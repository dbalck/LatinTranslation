<start> Litteris Gaius Caesaris consulibus redditis aegre ab his impetratum est summa tribunorum plebis contentione , ut in senatu recitarentur ; ut vero ex litteris ad senatum referretur , impetrari non potuit . <end>$$<start> When Caesar's letter was delivered to the consuls , they were with great difficulty , and a hard struggle of the tribunes , prevailed on to suffer it to be read in the senate ; but the tribunes could not prevail , that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the letter . <end>
<start> Referunt consules de re publica in civitate . <end>$$<start> The consuls put the question on the regulation of the state . <end>
<start> Incitat Lucius Lentulus consul senatu rei publicae se non defuturum pollicetur , si audacter ac fortiter sententias dicere velint ; sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam sequantur , ut superioribus fecerint temporibus , se sibi consilium capturum neque senatus auctoritati obtemperaturum : habere se quoque ad Caesaris gratiam atque amicitiam receptum . <end>$$<start> Lucius Lentulus the consul promises that he will not fail the senate and republic , if they declared their sentiments boldly and resolutely , but if they turned their regard to Caesar , and courted his favor , as they did on former occasions , he would adopt a plan for himself , and not submit to the authority of the senate : that he too had a means of regaining Caesar's favor and friendship . <end>
<start> In eandem sententiam loquitur Scipio : Pompeio esse in animo rei publicae non deesse , si senatus sequatur ; si cunctetur atque agat lenius , nequiquam eius auxilium , si postea velit , senatum imploraturum . <end>$$<start> Scipio spoke to the same purport , that it was Pompey's intention not to abandon the republic , if the senate would support him ; but if they should hesitate and act without energy , they would in vain implore his aid , if they should require it hereafter . <end>
<start> Haec Scipionis oratio , quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque aberat , ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur . <end>$$<start> This speech of Scipio's , as the senate was convened in the city , and Pompey was near at hand , seemed to have fallen from the lips of Pompey himself . <end>
<start> Dixerat aliquis leniorem sententiam , ut primo Marcus Marcellus , ingressus in eam orationem , non oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri , quam dilectus tota Italia habiti et exercitus conscripti essent , quo praesidio tuto et libere senatus , quae vellet , decernere auderet ; ut Marcus Calidius , qui censebat , ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficieceretur , ne qua esset armorum causa : timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus , ne ad eius periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur ; ut Marcus Rufus , qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus sequebatur . <end>$$<start> Some delivered their sentiments with more moderation , as Marcellus first , who in the beginning of his speech , said , that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter , till levies were made throughout all Italy , and armies raised under whose protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as they thought proper ; as Marcus Calidius afterward , who was of opinion , that Pompey should set out for his province , that there might be no cause for arms ; that Caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced from him , that Pompey was retaining those troops , and keeping them near the city to do him injury : as Marcus Rufus , who followed Calidius almost word for word . <end>
<start> Hi omnes convicio Lucius Lentuli consulis correpti exagitabantur . <end>$$<start> They were all harshly rebuked by Lentulus , who peremptorily refused to propose Calidius's motion . <end>
<start> Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnina negavit . <end>$$<start> Marcellus , overawed by his reproofs , retracted his opinion . <end>
<start> Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia discessit Sic vocibus consulis , terrore praesentis exercitus , minis amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis sententiam sequuntur : uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat ; si non faciat , eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri . <end>$$<start> Thus most of the senate , intimidated by the expressions of the consul , by the fears of a present army , and the threats of Pompey's friends , unwillingly and reluctantly adopted Scipio's opinion , that Caesar should disband his army by a certain day , and should he not do so , he should he considered as acting against the state . <end>
<start> Intercedit Marcus Antonius , Quintus Cassius , tribuni plebis . <end>$$<start> Marcus Antonius , and Quintus Cassius , tribunes of the people , interposed . <end>
<start> Refertur confestim de intersessione tribunorum . <end>$$<start> The question was immediately put on their interposition . <end>
<start> Dicuntur sententiae graves ; ut quisque acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit , ita quam maxime ab inimicis Caesaris collaudatur . <end>$$<start> Violent opinions were expressed ; whoever spoke with the greatest acrimony and cruelty was most highly commended by Caesar's enemies . <end>
<start> Misso ad vesperum senatu omnes , qui sunt eius ordinis , a Pompeio evocantur . <end>$$<start> The senate having broken up in the evening , all who belonged to that order were summoned by Pompey . <end>
<start> Laudat promptos Pompeius atque in posterum confirmat , segniores castigat atque incitat . <end>$$<start> Many veterans , from all parts , who had served in Pompey's armies , were invited to his standard by the hopes of rewards and promotions . <end>
<start> Multi undique ex veteribus Pompei exercitibus spe praemiorum atque ordinum evocantur , multi ex duabus legionibus , quae sunt traditae a Caesare , arcessuntur . <end>$$<start> Several officers belonging to the two legions , which had been delivered up by Caesar , were sent for . <end>
<start> Omnes amici consulum , necessarii Pompei atque eorum , qui veteres inimicitias cum Caesare gerebant , in senatum coguntur ; quorum vocibus et concursu terrentur infirmiores , dubii confirmantur , plerisque vero libere decernendi potestas eripitur . <end>$$<start> By their concourse and declarations the timid were awed , the irresolute confirmed , and the greater part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments with freedom . <end>
<start> Pollicetur Lucius Piso censor sese iturum ad Caesarem , item Lucius Roscius praetor , qui de his rebus eum doceant : sex dies ad eam rem conficiendam spatii postulant . <end>$$<start> Lucius Piso , the censor , offered to go to Caesar : as did likewise Lucius Roscius , the praetor , to inform him of these affairs , and require only six days' time to finish the business . <end>
<start> Omnibus his resistitur , omnibusque oratio consulis , Scipionis , Catonis opponitur . <end>$$<start> All these proposals were rejected , and opposition made to them all , in the speeches of the consul , Scipio , and Cato . <end>
<start> Lentulus aeris alieni magnitudine et spe exercitus ac provinciarum et regum appellandorum largitionibus movetur , seque alterum fore Sullam inter suos gloriatur , ad quem summa imperii redeat . <end>$$<start> Similar hopes of a province and armies , which he expected to share with Pompey on account of his connection with him , urged on Scipio ; and moreover he was influenced by the fear of being called to trial , and the adulation and an ostentatious display of himself and his friends in power , who at that time had great influence in the republic , and courts of judicature . <end>
<start> Scipionem eadem spes provinciae atque exercituum impellit , quos se pro necessitudine partiturum cum Pompeio arbitratur , simul iudiciorum metus , adulatio atque ostentatia sui et potentium , qui in re publica iudiciisque tum plurimum pollebant . <end>$$<start> Pompey himself , incited by Caesar's enemies , because he was unwilling that any person should bear an equal degree of dignity , had wholly alienated himself from Caesar's friendship , and procured a reconciliation with their common enemies ; the greatest part of whom he had himself brought upon Caesar during his affinity with him . <end>
<start> His de causis aguntur omnia raptim atque turbate Nec docendi Caesaris propinquis eius spatium datur , nec tribunis plebis sui periculi deprecandi neque etiam extremi iuris intercessione retinendi , quod Lucius Sulla reliquerat , facultas tribuitur , sed de sua salute septimo die cogitare coguntur , quod illi turbulentissimi superioribus temporibus tribuni plebis octavo denique mense suarum actionum respicere ac timere consuerant . <end>$$<start> For these reasons every thing was done in a hasty and disorderly manner , and neither was time given to Caesar's relations to inform him of the state of affairs nor liberty to the tribunes of the people to deprecate their own danger , nor even to retain the last privilege , which Sylla had left them , the interposing their authority ; but on the seventh day they were obliged to think of their own safety , which the most turbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to , nor to fear being called to an account for their actions , till the eighth month . <end>
<start> Decurritur ad illud extremum atque ultimum senatus consultum , quo nisi paene in ipso urbis incendio atque in desperatione omnium salutis sceleratorum audacia numquam ante descensum est : dent operam consules , praetores , tribuni plebis , quique pro consulibus sint ad urbem , ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat . <end>$$<start> Recourse is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate (which was never resorted to even by daring proposers except when the city was in danger of being set on fire , or when the public safety was despaired of) . <end>
<start> Haec senatusconsulto perscribuntur ad VII Id Ian Itaque V primis diebus , quibus haberi senatus potuit , qua ex die consulatum iniit Lentulus , biduo excepto comitiali et de imperio Caesaris et de amplissimis viris , tribunis plebis , gravissime acerbissimeque decernitur . <end>$$<start> That the consuls , praetors , tribunes of the people , and proconsuls in the city , should take care that the state received no injury . <end>
<start> Is eo tempore erat Ravennae exspectabatque suis lenissimis postulatis responsa , si qua hominum aequitate res ad otium deduci posset . <end>$$<start> The latter immediately made their escape from the city , and withdrew to Caesar , who was then at Ravenna , awaiting an answer to his moderate demands ; to see if matters could be brought to a peaceful termination by any equitable act on the part of his enemies . <end>
<start> Proximis diebus habetur extra urbem senatus . <end>$$<start> During the succeeding days the senate is convened outside the city . <end>
<start> Statim de reliquis rebus ad senatum refertur : tota Italia delectus habeatur ; Faustus Sulla propere in Mauretaniam mittatur ; pecunia uti ex aerario Pompeio detur . <end>$$<start> He applauded the courage and firmness of the senate , acquainted them with his force , and told them that he had ten legions ready ; that he was moreover informed and assured that Caesar's soldiers were disaffected , and that he could not persuade them to defend or even follow him . <end>
<start> De reliquis rebus senatusconsulta perscribuntur . <end>$$<start> But Marcellus said that he would not allow this motion for the present . <end>
<start> Provinciae privatis decernuntur duae consulares , reliquae praetoriae . <end>$$<start> Philip , one of the tribunes , stopped the appointment of Sylla ; the resolutions respecting the other matters passed . <end>
<start> Scipioni obvenit Syria , Lucius Domitio Gallia ; Philippus et Cotta privato consilio praetereuntur , neque eorum sortes deiciuntur . <end>$$<start> The provinces , two of which were consular , the remainder praetorian , were decreed to private persons ; Scipio got Syria , Lucius Domitius Gaul : Philip and Marcellus were omitted , from a private motive , and their lots were not even admitted . <end>
<start> Neque exspectant , quod superioribus annis acciderat , ut de eorum imperio ad popullim feratur paludatique votis nuncupatis exeant . <end>$$<start> Both the consuls leave the city , and private men had lictors in the city and capital , contrary to all precedents of former times . <end>
<start> Consules , quod ante id tempus accidit nunquam , ex urbe proficiscuntur , lictoresque habent in urbe et Capitolio privati contra omnia vetustatis exempla . <end>$$<start> Levies were made throughout Italy , arms demanded , and money exacted from the municipal towns , and violently taken from the temples . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar apud milites contionatur Omnium temporum iniurias inimicorum in se commemorat ; a quibus deductum ac depravatum Pompeium queritur invidia atque obtrectatione laudis suae , cuius ipse honori et dignitati semper faverit adiutorque fuerit . <end>$$<start> These things being made known to Caesar , he harangued his soldiers ; he reminded them of the wrongs done to him at all times by his enemies , and complained that Pompey had been alienated from him and led astray by them through envy and a malicious opposition to his glory , though he had always favored and promoted Pompey's honor and dignity . <end>
<start> Cognita militum voluntate Ariminum cum ea legione proficiscitur ibique tribunos plebis , qui ad eum profugerant , convenit ; reliquas legiones ex hibernis evocat et subsequi iubet . <end>$$<start> Having made himself acquainted with the disposition of his soldiers , Caesar set off with that legion to Ariminum , and there met the tribunes , who had fled to him for protection ; he called his other legions from winter quarters ; and ordered them to follow him . <end>
<start> Eo Lucius Caesar adulescens venit , cuius pater Caesaris erat legatus . <end>$$<start> Thither came Lucius Caesar , a young man , whose father was a lieutenant-general under Caesar . <end>
<start> Is reliquo sermone confecto , cuius rei causa venerat , habere se a Pompeio ad eum privati officii mandata demonstrat : velle Pompeium se Caesari purgatum , ne ea , quae rei publicae causa egerit , in suam contumeliam vertat Semper se rei publicae commoda privatis necessitudinibus habuisse potiora Caesarem quoque pro sua dignitate debere et studium et iracundiam suam rei publicae dimittere neque adeo graviter irasci inimicis , ut , cum illis nocere se speret , rei publicae noceat . <end>$$<start> He , after concluding the rest of his speech , and stating for what purpose he had come , told Caesar that he had commands of a private nature for him from Pompey ; that Pompey wished to clear himself to Caesar , lest he should impute those actions which he did for the republic , to a design of affronting him ; that he had ever preferred the interest of the state to his own private connections ; that Caesar , too , for his own honor , ought to sacrifice his desires and resentment to the public good , and not vent his anger so violently against his enemies , lest in his hopes of injuring them , he should injure the republic . <end>
<start> Pauca eiusdem generis addit cum excusatione Pompei coniuncta . <end>$$<start> He spoke a few words to the same purport from himself , in addition to Pompey's apology . <end>
<start> Eadem fere atque eisdem verbis praetor Roscius agit cum Caesare sibique Pompeium commemorasse demonstrat . <end>$$<start> Roscius , the praetor , conferred with Caesar almost in the same words , and on the same subject , and declared that Pompey had empowered him to do so . <end>
<start> Quae res etsi nihil ad levandas iniurias pertinere videbantur , tamen idoneos nactus homines , per quos ea , quae vellet , ad eum perferrentur , petit ab utroque , quoniam Pompei mandata ad se detulerint , ne graventur sua quoque ad eum postulata deferre , si parvo labore magnas controversias tollere atque omnem Italiam metu liberare possint . <end>$$<start> Though these things seemed to have no tendency toward redressing his injuries , yet having got proper persons by whom he could communicate his wishes to Pompey ; he required of them both , that , as they had conveyed Pompey's demands to him , they should not refuse to convey his demands to Pompey ; if by so little trouble they could terminate a great dispute , and liberate all Italy from her fears . <end>
<start> Sibi semper primam rei publicae fuisse dignitatem vitaque potiorem Doluisse se , quod populi Romani beneficium sibi per contumeliam ab inimicis extorqueretur , ereptoque semenstri imperio in urbem retraheretur , cuius absentis rationem haberi proximis comitiis populus iussisset Tamen hanc iacturam honoris sui rei publicae causa aequo animo tulisse ; cum litteras ad senatum miserit , ut omnes ab exercitibus discederent , ne id quidem impetravisse . <end>$$<start> That the honor of the republic had ever been his first object , and dearer to him than life ; that he was chagrined , that the favor of the Roman people was wrested from him by the injurious reports of his enemies ; that he was deprived of a half-year's command , and dragged back to the city , though the people had ordered that regard should be paid to his suit for the consulate at the next election , though he was not present ; that , however , he had patiently submitted to this loss of honor , for the sake of the republic ; that when he wrote letters to the senate , requiring that all persons should resign the command of their armies , he did not obtain even that request ; that levies were made throughout Italy ; that the two legions which had been taken from him , under the pretense of the Parthian war , were kept at home , and that the state was in arms . <end>
<start> Tota Italia delectus haberi , retineri legiones II , quae ab se simulatione Parthici belli sint abductae , civitatem esse in armis . <end>$$<start> To what did all these things tend , unless to his ruin ? But , nevertheless , he was ready to condescend to any terms , and to endure every thing for the sake of the republic . <end>
<start> Quonam haec omnia nisi ad suam perniciem pertinere ? Sed tamen ad omnia se descendere paratum atque omnia pati rei publicae causa Proficiscatur Pompeius in suas provincias , ipsi exercitus dimittant , discedant in Italia omnes ab armis , metus e civitate tollatur , libera comitia atque omnis res publica senatui populoque Romano permittatur . <end>$$<start> Let Pompey go to his own province ; let them both disband their armies ; let all persons in Italy lay down their arms ; let all fears be removed from the city ; let free elections , and the whole republic be resigned to the direction of the senate and Roman people . <end>
<start> Haec quo facilius certisque condicionibus fiant et iureiurando sanciantur , aut ipse propius accedat aut se patiatur accedere : fore uti per colloquia omnes controversiae componantur . <end>$$<start> That these things might be the more easily performed , and conditions secured and confirmed by oath , either let Pompey come to Caesar , or allow Caesar to go to him ; it might be that all their disputes would be settled by an interview . <end>
<start> Acceptis mandatis Roscius cum Lucius Caesare Capuam pervenit ibique consules Pompeiumque invenit ; postulata Caesaris renuntiat . <end>$$<start> Roscius and Lucius Caesar , having received this message , went to Capua , where they met the consuls and Pompey , and declared to them Caesar's terms . <end>
<start> Illi deliberata re respondent scriptaque ad eum mandata per eos remittunt ; quorum haec erat summa : Caesar in Galliam reverteretur , Arimino excederet , exercitus dimitteret ; quae si fecisset , Pompeium in Hispanias iturum . <end>$$<start> Having deliberated on the matter , they replied , and sent written proposals to him by the same persons , the purport of which was , that Caesar should return into Gaul , leave Ariminum , and disband his army : if he complied with this , that Pompey would go to Spain . <end>
<start> Interea , quoad fides esset data Caesarem facturum , quae polliceretur , non intermissuros consules Pompeiumque delectus . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , until security was given that Caesar would perform his promises , that the consuls and Pompey would not give over their levies . <end>
<start> Erat iniqua condicio postulare , ut Caesar Arimino excederet atque in provinciam reverteretur , ipsum et provincias et legiones alienas tenere ; exercitum Caesaris velle dimitti , delectus habere ; polliceri se in provineiam iturum neque , ante quem diem iturus sit , definire , ut , si peracto consulatu Caesar profectus esset , nulla tamen mendacii religione obstrictus videretur ; tempus vero colloquio non dare neque accessurum polliceri magnam pacis desperationem afferebat . <end>$$<start> It was not an equitable proposal , to require that Caesar should quit Ariminum and return to his province ; but that he Pompey should himself retain his province and the legions that belonged to another , and desire that Caesar's army should be disbanded , while he himself was making new levies : and that he should merely promise to go to his province , without naming the day on which he would set out ; so that if he should not set out till after Caesar's consulate expired , yet he would not appear bound by any religious scruples about asserting a falsehood . <end>
<start> Interea certior factus Iguium Thermum praetorem cohortibus V tenere , oppidum munire , omniumque esse Iguvinorum optimam erga se voluntatem , Curionem cum tribus cohortibus , quas Pisauri et Arimini habebat , mittit . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , being informed that Thermus the praetor was in possession of Iguvium , with five cohorts , and was fortifying the town , but that the affections of all the inhabitants were very well inclined toward himself , he detached Curio with three cohorts , which he had at Ariminum and Pisaurus . <end>

<start> Curio summa omnium voluntate Iguvium recepit . <end>$$<start> Curio recovered Iguvium , with the cheerful concurrence of all the inhabitants . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis confisus municipiorum voluntatibus Caesar cohortes legionis XIII ex praesidiis deducit Auximumque proficiscitur ; quod oppidum Attius cohortibus introductis tenebat delectumque toto Piceno circummissis senatoribus habebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having received an account of this , and relying on the affections of the municipal towns , drafted all the cohorts of the thirteenth legion from the garrison , and set out for Auximum , a town into which Attius had brought his cohorts , and of which he had taken possession , and from which he had sent senators round about the country of Picenum , to raise new levies . <end>
<start> Adventu Caesaris cognito decuriones Auximi ad Attium Varum frequentes conveniunt ; docent sui iudicii rem non esse ; neque se neque reliquos municipes pati posse Gaius Caesarem imperatorem , bene de re publica meritum , tantis rebus gestis oppido moenibusque prohiberi ; proinde habeat rationem posteritatis et periculi sui . <end>$$<start> Upon news of Caesar's approach , the senate of Auximum went in a body to Attius Varus ; and told him that it was not a subject for them to determine upon : yet neither they , nor the rest of the freemen would suffer Caius Caesar , a general , who had merited so well of the republic , after performing such great achievements , to be excluded from their town and walls ; wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion of posterity , and his own danger . <end>
<start> Quorum oratione permotus Varus praesidium , quod introduxerat , ex oppido educit ac profugit . <end>$$<start> Alarmed at this declaration , Attius Varus drew out of the town the garrison which he had introduced , and fled . <end>
<start> At Caesar milites Attianos collaudat , Pupium dimittit , Auximatibus agit gratias seque eorum facti memorem fore pollicetur . <end>$$<start> But Caesar applauded the soldiers of Attius , set Pupius at liberty , returned thanks to the people of Auximum , and promised to be grateful for their conduct . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus Romam nuntiatis tantus repente terror invasit , ut cum Lentulus consul ad aperiendum aerarium venisset ad pecuniamque Pompeio ex senatusconsulto proferendam , protinus aperto sanctiore aerario ex urbe profugeret . <end>$$<start> Intelligence of this being brought to Rome , so great a panic spread on a sudden that when Lentulus , the consul , came to open the treasury , to deliver money to Pompey by the senate's decree , immediately on opening the hallowed door he fled from the city . <end>
<start> Caesar enim adventare iam iamque et adesse eius equites falso nuntiabantur . <end>$$<start> For it was falsely rumored that Caesar was approaching , and that his cavalry were already at the gates . <end>
<start> Hunc Marcellus collega et plerique magistratus consecuti sunt . <end>$$<start> Marcellus , his colleague , followed him , and so did most of the magistrates . <end>
<start> Gnaeus Pompeius pridie eius diei ex urbe profectus iter ad legiones habebat , quas a Caesare acceptas in Apulia hibernorum causa disposuerat . <end>$$<start> Cneius Pompey had left the city the day before , and was on his march to those legions which he had received from Caesar , and had disposed in winter quarters in Apulia . <end>
<start> Delectus circa urbem intermittuntur ; nihil citra Capuam tutum esse omnibus videtur . <end>$$<start> The levies were stopped within the city No place on this side of Capua was thought secure . <end>
<start> Capuae primum se confirmant et colligunt delectumque colonorum , qui lege Iulia Capuam deducti erant , habere instituunt ; gladiatoresque , quos ibi Caesar in ludo habebat , ad forum productos Lentulus spe libertatis confirmat atque iis equos attribuit et se sequi iussit ; quos postea monitus ab suis , quod ea res omnium iudicio reprehendebatur , circum familias conventus Campani custodiae causa distribuit . <end>$$<start> At Capua they first began to take courage and to rally , and determined to raise levies in the colonies , which had been sent thither by the Julian law : and Lentulus brought into the public market place the gladiators which Caesar maintained there for the entertainment of the people , and confirmed them in their liberty , and gave them horses and ordered them to attend him ; but afterward , being warned by his friends that this action was censured by the judgment of all , he distributed them among the slaves of the district of Campania , to keep guard there . <end>

<start> Mittit eo Marcus Antonium cum legionis XIII cohortibus V Sulmonenses simulatque signa nostra viderunt , portas aperuerunt universique , et oppidani et milites , obviam gratulantes Antonio exierunt . <end>$$<start> He sent Marcus Antonius thither , with five cohorts of the eighth legion The inhabitants , as soon as they saw our standards , threw open their gates , and all the people , both citizens and soldiers , went out to meet and welcome Antonius . <end>
<start> Lucretius et Attius de muro se deiecerunt . <end>$$<start> Lucretius and Attius leaped off the walls . <end>
<start> Attius ad Antonium deductus petit ut ad Caesarem mitteretur . <end>$$<start> Attius , being brought before Antonius , begged that he might be sent to Caesar . <end>
<start> Antonius cum cohortibus et Attio eodem die , quo profectus erat , revertitur . <end>$$<start> Antonius returned the same day on which he had set out with the cohorts and Attius . <end>
<start> Caesar eas cohortes cum exercitu suo coniunxit Attiumque incolumem dimisit . <end>$$<start> Caesar added these cohorts to his own army , and sent Attius away in safety . <end>
<start> Caesar primis diebus castra magnis operibus munire et ex finitimis municipiis frumentum comportare reliquasque copias exspectare instituit . <end>$$<start> The three first days Caesar employed in fortifying his camp with strong works , in bringing in corn from the neighboring free towns , and waiting for the rest of his forces . <end>
<start> Eo triduo legio VIII ad eum venit cohortesque ex novis Galliae dilectibus XXII equitesque ab rege Norico circiter CCC . <end>$$<start> Within the three days the eighth legion came to him , and twenty-two cohorts of the new levies in Gaul , and about three hundred horse from the king of Noricum . <end>
<start> Quorum adventu altera castra ad alteram oppidi partem ponit ; his castris Curionem praefecit . <end>$$<start> On their arrival he made a second camp on another part of the town , and gave the command of it to Curio . <end>
<start> Reliquis diebus oppidum vallo castellisque circummunire instituit . <end>$$<start> He determined to surround the town with a rampart and turrets during the remainder of the time . <end>
<start> Cuius operis maxima parte effecta eodem fere tempore missi a Pompeio revertuntur . <end>$$<start> Nearly at the time when the greatest part of the work was completed , all the messengers sent to Pompey returned . <end>
<start> Litteris perlectis Domitius dissimulans in consilio pronuntiat Pompeium celeriter subsidio venturum hortaturque eos , ne animo deficiant quaeque usui ad defendendum oppidum sint parent . <end>$$<start> Having read Pompey's letter , Domitius , concealing the truth , gave out in council that Pompey would speedily come to their assistance ; and encouraged them not to despond , but to provide every thing necessary for the defense of the town . <end>
<start> Ipse arcano cum paucis familiaribus suis colloquitur consiliumque fugae capere constituit . <end>$$<start> He held private conferences with a few of his most intimate friends , and determined on the design of fleeing . <end>
<start> Cum vultus Domiti cum oratione non consentiret , atque omnia trepidantius timidiusque ageret , quam superioribus diebus consuesset , multumque cum suis consiliandi causa secreto praeter consuetudinem colloqueretur , concilia conventusque hominum fugeret , res diutius tegi dissimularique non potuit . <end>$$<start> As Domitius's countenance did not agree with his words , and he did every thing with more confusion and fear than he had shown on the preceding days , and as he had several private meetings with his friends , contrary to his usual practice , in order to take their advice , and as he avoided all public councils and assemblies of the people , the truth could be no longer hid nor dissembled ; for Pompey had written back in answer , That he would not put matters to the last hazard ; that Domitius had retreated into the town of Corfinium without either his advice or consent . <end>
<start> Id ne fieri posset , obsidione atque oppidi circummunitione fiebat . <end>$$<start> But the blockade and works round the town prevented his escape . <end>
<start> Divulgato Domiti consilio milites , qui erant Corfinii , prima vesperi secessionem faciunt atque ita inter se per tribunos militum centurionesque atque honestissimos sui generis colloquuntur : obsideri se a Caesare , opera munitionesque prope esse perfectas ; ducem suum Domitium , cuius spe atque fiducia permanserint , proiectis omnibus fugae consilium capere : debere se suae salutis rationem habere . <end>$$<start> Domitius's design being noised abroad , the soldiers in Corfinium early in the evening began to mutiny , and held a conference with each other by their tribunes and centurions , and the most respectable among themselves : that they were besieged by Caesar ; that his works and fortifications were almost finished ; that their general , Domitius , on whose hopes and expectations they had confided , had thrown them off , and was meditating his own escape ; that they ought to provide for their own safety . <end>
<start> Ab his primo Marsi dissentire incipiunt eamque oppidi partem , quae munitissima videretur , occupant , tantaque inter eos dissensio exsistit , ut manum conserere atque armis dimicare conentur ; post paulo tamen internuntiis ultro citroque missis quae ignorabant , de Lucius Domiti fuga , cognoscunt . <end>$$<start> However , in a little time , by messengers sent from one side to the other , they were informed of Domitius's meditated flight , of which they were previously ignorant . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar , etsi magni interesse arbitrabatur quam primum oppido potiri cohortesque ad se in castra traducere , ne qua aut largitionibus aut animi confirmatione aut falsis nuntiis commutatio fieret voluntatis , quod saepe in bello parvis momentis magni casus intercederent , tamen veritus , ne militum introitu et nocturni temporis licentia oppidum diriperetur , eos , qui venerant , collaudat atque in oppidum dimittit , portas murosque adservari iubet . <end>$$<start> Upon intelligence of these matters , though Caesar thought it of great consequence to become master of the town as soon as possible , and to transfer the cohorts to his own camp , lest any change should be wrought on their inclinations by bribes , encouragement , or ficticious messages , because in war great events are often brought about by trifling circumstances ; yet , dreading lest the town should be plundered by the soldiers entering into it , and taking advantage of the darkness of the night , he commended the persons who came to him , and sent them back to the town , and ordered the gates and walls to be secured . <end>
<start> Ipse eis operibus , quae facere instituerat , milites disponit non certis spatiis intermissis , ut erat superiorum dierum consuetudo , sed perpetuis vigiliis stationibusque , ut contingant inter se atque omnem munitionem expleant ; tribunos militum et praefectos circummittit atque hortatur , non solum ab eruptionibus caveant , sed etiam singulorum hominum occultos exitus adservent . <end>$$<start> He disposed his soldiers on the works which he had begun , not at certain intervals , as was his practice before , but in one continued range of sentinels and stations , so that they touched each other , and formed a circle round the whole fortification ; he ordered the tribunes and general officers to ride round ; and exhorted them not only to be on their guard against sallies from the town , but also to watch that no single person should get out privately . <end>
<start> Neque vero tam remisso ac languido animo quisquam omnium fuit , qui ea nocte conquieverit . <end>$$<start> Nor was any man so negligent or drowsy as to sleep that night . <end>
<start> Tanta erat summae rerum exspectatio , ut alius in aliam partem mente atque animo traheretur , quid ipsis Corfiniensibus , quid Domitio , quid Lentulo , quid reliquis accideret , qui quosque eventus exciperent . <end>$$<start> To so great height was their expectation raised , that they were carried away , heart and soul , each to different objects , what would become of the Corfinians , what of Domitius , what of Lentulus , what of the rest ; what event would be the consequence of another . <end>
<start> Quarta vigilia circiter Lentulus Spinther de muro cum vigiliis custodibusque nostris colloquitur ; velle , si sibi fiat potestas , Caesarem convenire . <end>$$<start> About the fourth watch , Lentulus Spinther said to our sentinels and guards from the walls , that he desired to have an interview with Caesar , if permission were given him . <end>
<start> Facta potestate ex oppido mittitur , neque ab eo prius Domitiani milites discedunt , quam in conspectum Caesaris deducatur . <end>$$<start> Having obtained it , he was escorted out of town ; nor did the soldiers of Domitius leave him till they brought him into Caesar's presence . <end>
<start> Cum eo de salute sua agit , orat atque obsecrat , ut sibi parcat , veteremque amicitiam commemorat Caesarisque in se beneficia exponit ; quae erant maxima : quod per eum in collegium pontificum venerat , quod provinciam Hispaniam ex praetura habuerat , quod in petitione consulatus erat sublevatus . <end>$$<start> He pleaded with Caesar for his life , and entreated him to spare him , and reminded him of their former friendship ; and acknowledged that Caesar's favors to him were very great ; in that through his interest he had been admitted into the college of priests ; in that after his praetorship he had been appointed to the government of Spain ; in that he had been assisted by him in his suit for the consulate . <end>
<start> Cuius orationem Caesar interpellat : se non maleficii causa ex provincia egressum , sed uti se a contumeliis inimicorum defenderet , ut tribunos plebis in ea re ex civitate expulsos in suam dignitatem restitueret , ut se et populum Romanum factione paucorum oppressum in libertatem vindicaret . <end>$$<start> Caesar interrupted him in his speech , and told him , that he had not left his province to do mischief to any man , but to protect himself from the injuries of his enemies ; to restore to their dignity the tribunes of the people who had been driven out of the city on his account , and to assert his own liberty , and that of the Roman people , who were oppressed by a few factious men . <end>
<start> Cuius oratione confirmatus Lentulus , ut in oppidum reverti liceat , petit : quod de sua salute impetraverit , fore etiam reliquis ad suam spem solatio ; adeo esse perterritos nonnullos , ut suae vitae durius consulere cogantur . <end>$$<start> Encouraged by this address , Lentulus begged leave to return to the town , that the security which he had obtained for himself might be an encouragement to the rest to hope for theirs ; saying that some were so terrified that they were induced to make desperate attempts on their own lives . <end>
<start> Facta potestate discedit . <end>$$<start> Leave being granted him , he departed . <end>
<start> Caesar , ubi luxit , omnes senatores senatorumque liberos , tribunos militum equitesque Romanos ad se produci iubet . <end>$$<start> When day appeared , Caesar ordered all the senators and their children , the tribunes of the soldiers , and the Roman knights to be brought before him . <end>
<start> Quintilius Varus quaestor , Lucius Rubrius ; praeterea filius Domiti aliique complures adulescentes et magnus numerus equitum Romanorum et decurionum , quos ex municipiis Domitius evocaverat . <end>$$<start> When they were brought before him he protected them from the insolence and taunts of the soldiers ; told them in few words that they had not made him a grateful return , on their part , for his very extraordinary kindness to them , and dismissed them all in safety . <end>
<start> Hos omnes productos a contumeliis militum conviciisque prohibet ; pauca apud eos loquitur , queritur quod sibi a parte eorum gratia relata non sit pro suis in eos maximis beneficiis ; dimittit omnes incolumes . <end>$$<start> Sixty sestertia , which Domitius had brought with him and lodged in the public treasury , being brought to Caesar by the magistrates of Corfinium , he gave them back to Domitius , that he might not appear more moderate with respect to the life of men than in money matters , though he knew that it was public money , and had been given by Pompey to pay his army . <end>
<start> Milites Domitianos sacramentum apud se dicere iubet atque eo die castra movet iustumque iter conficit VII omnino dies ad Corfinium commoratus , et per fines Marrucinorum , Frentranorum , Larinatium in Apuliam pervenit . <end>$$<start> He staid only seven days before Corfinium , and marched into Apulia through the country of the Marrucinians , Frentanian's and Larinates . <end>
<start> Pompeius his rebus cognitis , quae erant ad Corfinium gestae , Luceria proficiscitur Canusium atque inde Brundisium . <end>$$<start> Pompey , being informed of what had passed at Corfinium , marches from Luceria to Canusium , and thence to Brundusium . <end>
<start> Copias undique omnes ex novis dilectibus ad se cogi iubet ; servos , pastores armat atque eis equos attribuit ; ex his circiter CCC equites conficit . <end>$$<start> He orders all the forces raised every where by the new levies to repair to him . <end>
<start> Lucius Manlius praetor Alba cum cohortibus sex profugit , Rutilius Lupus praetor Tarracina cum tribus ; quae procul equitatum Caesaris conspicatae , cui praeerat Vibius Curius , relicto praetore signa ad Curium transferunt atque ad eum transeunt . <end>$$<start> He gives arms to the slaves that attended the flocks , and appoints horses for them Of these he made up about three hundred horse . <end>
<start> Item reliquis itineribus nonnullae cohortes in agmen Caesaris , aliae in equites incidunt . <end>$$<start> Lucius , the praetor , fled from Alba , with six cohorts : Rutilus , Lupus , the praetor , from Tarracina , with three . <end>
<start> Quem Caesar ad eum remittit cum mandatis : quoniam ad id tempus facultas colloquendi non fuerit , atque ipse Brundisium sit venturus , interesse rei publicae et communis salutis se cum Pompeio colloqui ; neque vero idem profici longo itineris spatio , cum per alios condiciones ferantur , ac si coram de omnibus condicionibus disceptetur . <end>$$<start> Cneius Magius , from Cremona , engineer-general to Pompey , was taken prisoner on the road and brought to Caesar , but sent back by him to Pompey with this message : As hitherto he had not been allowed an interview , and was now on his march to him at Brundusium , that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and general safety that he should have an interview with Pompey ; and that the same advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the proposals were conveyed to them by others , as if terms were argued by them both in person . <end>
<start> His datis mandatis Brundisium cum legionibus VI pervenit , veteranis III et reliquis , quas ex novo dilectu confecerat atque in itinere compleverat ; Domitianas enim cohortes protinus a Corfinio in Siciliam miserat . <end>$$<start> Having delivered this message he marched to Brundusium with six legions , four of them veterans : the rest those which he had raised in the late levy and completed on his march , for he had sent all Domitius's cohorts immediately from Corfinium to Sicily . <end>
<start> Reperit consules Dyrrachium profectos cum magna parte exercitus , Pompeium remanere Brundisii cum cohortibus viginti ; neque certum inveniri poterat , obtinendine Brundisii causa ibi remansisset , quo facilius omne Hadriaticum mare ex ultimis Italiae partibus regionibusque Graeciae in potestate haberet atque ex utraque parte bellum administrare posset , an inopia navium ibi restitisset , veritusque ne ille Italiam dimittendam non existimaret , exitus administrationesque Brundisini portus impedire instituit . <end>$$<start> He discovered that the consuls were gone to Dyrrachium with a considerable part of the army , and that Pompey remained at Brundusium with twenty cohorts ; but could not find out , for a certainty , whether Pompey staid behind to keep possession of Brundusium , that he might the more easily command the whole Adriatic sea , with the extremities of Italy and the coast of Greece , and be able to conduct the war on either side of it , or whether he remained there for want of shipping ; and , being afraid that Pompey would come to the conclusion that he ought not to relinquish Italy , he determined to deprive him of the means of communication afforded by the harbor of Brundusium . <end>
<start> Quorum operum haec erat ratio Qua fauces erant angustissimae portus , moles atque aggerem ab utraque parte litoris iaciebat , quod his locis erat vadosum mare . <end>$$<start> The plan of his work was as follows : Where the mouth of the port was narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on either side , because in these places the sea was shallow . <end>
<start> Longius progressus , cum agger altiore aqua contineri non posset , rates duplices quoquo versus pedum XXX e regione molis collocabat . <end>$$<start> Having gone out so far that the mole could not be continued in the deep water , he fixed double floats , thirty feet on either side , before the mole . <end>
<start> Has quaternis ancoris ex IIII angulis destinabat , ne fluctibus moverentur . <end>$$<start> These he fastened with four anchors at the four corners , that they might not be carried away by the waves . <end>
<start> His perfectis collocatisque alias deinceps pari magnitudine rates iungebat . <end>$$<start> Having completed and secured them , he then joined to them other floats of equal size . <end>
<start> Has terra atque aggere integebat , ne aditus atque incursus ad defendendum impediretur A fronte atque ab utroque latere cratibus ac pluteis protegebat ; in quarta quaque earum turres binorum tabulatorum excitabat , quo commodius ab impetu navium incendiisque defenderet . <end>$$<start> These he covered over with earth and mold , that he might not be prevented from access to them to defend them , and in the front and on both sides he protected them with a parapet of wicker work ; and on every fourth one raised a turret , two stories high , to secure them the better from being attacked by the shipping and set on fire . <end>
<start> Contra haec Pompeius naves magnas onerarias , quas in portu Brundisino deprehenderat , adornabat Ibi turres cum ternis tabulatis erigebat easque multis tormentis et omni genere telorum completas ad opera Caesaris adpellebat , ut rates perrumperet atque opera disturbaret . <end>$$<start> To counteract this , Pompey fitted out large merchant ships , which he found in the harbor of Brundusium : on them he erected turrets three stories high , and , having furnished them with several engines and all sorts of weapons , drove them among Caesar's works , to break through the floats and interrupt the works ; thus there happened skirmishes every day at a distance with slings , arrows , and other weapons . <end>
<start> Sic cotidie utrimque eminus fundis , sagittis reliquisque telis pugnabatur . <end>$$<start> Caesar conducted matters as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not yet to be given up . <end>
<start> Atque haec Caesar ita administrabat , ut condiciones pacis dimittendas non existimaret ; ac tametsi magnopere admirabatur Magium , quem ad Pompeium cum mandatis miserat , ad se non remitti , atque ea res saepe temptata etsi impetus eius consiliaque tardabat , tamen omnibus rebus in eo perseverandum putabat . <end>$$<start> And though he was very much surprised that Magius , whom he had sent to Pompey with a message , was not sent back to him ; and though his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous prosecution of his plans , yet he thought that he ought by all means to persevere in the same line of conduct . <end>
<start> Cuius rei magnam partem laudis atque existimationis ad Libonem perventuram , si illo auctore atque agente ab armis sit discessum . <end>$$<start> He charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace , but , above all things , requires that he should be admitted to an interview with Pompey . <end>
<start> Ita saepius rem frustra temptatam Caesar aliquando dimittendam sibi iudicat et de bello agendum . <end>$$<start> Caesar therefore thought it time at length to give over the attempt which he had often made in vain , and act with energy in the war . <end>
<start> Prope dimidia parte operis a Caesare effecta diebusque in ea re consumptis VIIII naves a consulibus Dyrrachio remissae , quae priorem partem exercitus eo deportaverant , Brundisium revertuntur . <end>$$<start> When Caesar's works were nearly half finished , and after nine days were spent in them , the ships which had conveyed the first division of the army to Dyrrachium being sent back by the consuls , returned to Brundusium . <end>
<start> Pompeius sive operibus Caesaris permotus sive etiam quod ab initio Italia excedere constituerat , adventu navium profectionem parare incipit et , quo facilius impetum Caesaris tardaret , ne sub ipsa profectione milites oppidum irrumperent , portas obstruit , vicos plateasque inaedificat , fossas transversas viis praeducit atque ibi sudes stipitesque praeacutos defigit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , either frightened at Caesar's works or determined from the beginning to quit Italy , began to prepare for his departure on the arrival of the ships ; and the more effectually to retard Caesar's attack , lest his soldiers should force their way into the town at the moment of his departure , he stopped up the gates , built walls across the streets and avenues , sunk trenches across the ways , and in them fixed palisadoes and sharp stakes , which he made level with the ground by means of hurdles and clay . <end>
<start> Haec levibus cratibus terraque inaequat ; aditus autem atque itinera duo , quae extra murum ad portum ferebant , maximis defixis trabibus atque eis praeacutis praesepit . <end>$$<start> But he barricaded with large beams fastened in the ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads without the walls , which led to the port . <end>
<start> His paratis rebus milites silentio naves conscendere iubet , expeditos autem ex evocatis , sagittariis funditoribusque raros in muro turribusque disponit . <end>$$<start> After making these arrangements , he ordered his soldiers to go on board without noise , and disposed here and there , on the wall and turrets , some light-armed veterans , archers and slingers . <end>
<start> Hos certo signo revocare constituit , cum omnes milites naves conscendissent , atque eis expedito loco actuaria navigia relinquit . <end>$$<start> These he designed to call off by a certain signal , when all the soldiers were embarked , and left row-galleys for them in a secure place . <end>
<start> Brundisini Pompeianorum militum iniuriis atque ipsius Pompei contumeliis permoti Caesaris rebus favebant . <end>$$<start> The people of Brundusium , irritated by the insolence of Pompey's soldiers , and the insults received from Pompey himself , were in favor of Caesar's party . <end>
<start> Itaque cognita Pompei profectione concursantibus illis atque in ea re occupatis vulgo ex tectis significabant Per quos re cognita Caesar scalas parari militesque armari iubet , ne quam rei gerendae facultatem dimittat . <end>$$<start> Therefore , as soon as they were aware of Pompey's departure , while his men were running up and down , and busied about their voyage , they made signs from the tops of the houses : Caesar , being apprised of the design by them , ordered scaling-ladders to be got ready , and his men to take arms , that he might not lose any opportunity of coming to an action . <end>
<start> Pompeius sub noctem naves solvit . <end>$$<start> Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall . <end>
<start> Qui erant in muro custodiae causa collocati , eo signo , quod convenerat , revocantur notisque itineribus ad naves decurrunt . <end>$$<start> The soldiers who had been posted on the wall to guard it , were called off by the signal which had been agreed on , and knowing the roads , ran down to the ships . <end>
<start> Milites positis scalis muros ascendunt , sed moniti a Brundisinis , ut vallum caecum fossasque caveant , subsistunt et longo itinere ab his circumducti ad portum perveniunt duasque naves cum militibus , quae ad moles Caesaris adhaeserant , scaphis lintribusque reprehendunt , reprehensas excipiunt . <end>$$<start> Caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls : but being cautioned by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered trenches , they halted , and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long circuit , they reached the port , and captured with their long boats and small craft two of Pompey's ships , full of soldiers , which had struck against Caesar's moles . <end>
<start> Caesar etsi ad spem conficiendi negotii maxime probabat coactis navibus mare transire et Pompeium sequi , priusquam ille sese transmarinis auxiliis confirmaret , tamen eius rei moram temporisque longinquitatem timebat , quod omnibus coactis navibus Pompeius praesentem facultatem insequendi sui ademerat . <end>$$<start> Though Caesar highly approved of collecting a fleet , and crossing the sea , and pursuing Pompey before he could strengthen himself with his transmarine auxiliaries , with the hope of bringing the war to a conclusion , yet he dreaded the delay and length of time necessary to effect it : because Pompey , by collecting all his ships , had deprived him of the means of pursuing him at present . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur , ut ex longinquioribus regionibus Galliae Picenique et a freto naves essent exspectandae . <end>$$<start> The only resource left to Caesar , was to wait for a fleet from the distant regions of Gaul , Picenum , and the straits of Gibraltar . <end>
<start> Id propter anni tempus longum atque impeditum videbatur . <end>$$<start> But this , on account of the season of the year , appeared tedious and troublesome . <end>
<start> Interea veterem exercitum , duas Hispanias confirmari , quarum erat altera maximis beneficiis Pompei devincta , auxilia , equitatum parari , Galliam Italiamque temptari se absente nolebat . <end>$$<start> He was unwilling that , in the mean time , the veteran army , and the two Spains , one of which was bound to Pompey by the strongest obligations , should be confirmed in his interest ; that auxiliaries and cavalry should be provided , and Gaul and Italy reduced in his absence . <end>
<start> Itaque in praesentia Pompei sequendi rationem omittit , in Hispaniam proficisci constituit : duumviris municipiorum omnium imperat , ut naves conquirant Brundisiumque deducendas curent . <end>$$<start> Therefore , for the present he relinquished all intention of pursuing Pompey , and resolved to march to Spain , and commanded the magistrates of the free towns to procure him ships , and to have them convoyed to Brundusium . <end>
<start> Mittit in Sardiniam cum legione una Valerium legatum , in Siciliam Curionem pro praetore cum legionibus duabus ; eundem , cum Siciliam recepisset , protinus in Africam traducere exercitum iubet . <end>$$<start> He detached Valerius , his lieutenant , with one legion to Sardinia ; Curio , the propraetor , to Sicily with three legions ; and ordered him , when he had recovered Sicily , to immediately transport his army to Africa . <end>
<start> Sardiniam obtinebat Marcus Cotta , Siciliam Marcus Cato ; Africam sorte Tubero obtinere debebat . <end>$$<start> Marcus Cotta was at this time governor of Sardinia : Marcus Cato , of Sicily : and Tubero , by the lots , should have had the government of Africa . <end>
<start> Caralitani , simul ad se Valerium mitti audierunt , nondum profecto ex Italia sua sponte Cottam ex oppido eiciunt Ille perterritus , quod omnem provinciam consentire intellegebat , ex Sardinia in Africam profugit . <end>$$<start> The Caralitani , as soon as they heard that Valerius was sent against them , even before he left Italy , of their own accord drove Cotta out of the town ; who , terrified because he understood that the whole province was combined against him , fled from Sardinia to Africa . <end>
<start> Cato in Sicilia naves longas veteres reficiebat , novas civitatibus imperabat . <end>$$<start> Cato was in Sicily , repairing the old ships of war , and demanding new ones from the states , and these things he performed with great zeal . <end>
<start> Haec magno studio agebat In Lucanis Brutiisque per legatos suos civium Romanorum delectus habebat , equitum peditumque certum numerum a civitatibus Siciliae exigebat . <end>$$<start> He was raising levies of Roman citizens , among the Lucani and Brutii , by his lieutenants , and exacting a certain quota of horse and foot from the states of Sicily . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus paene perfectis adventu Curionis cognito queritur in contione sese proiectum ac proditum a Gnaeus Pompeio , qui omnibus rebus imparatissimis non necessarium bellum suscepisset et ab se reliquisque in senatu interrogatus omnia sibi esse ad bellum apta ac parata confirmavisset . <end>$$<start> When these things were nearly completed , being informed of Curio's approach , he made a complaint that he was abandoned and betrayed by Pompey , who had undertaken an unnecessary war , without making any preparation , and when questioned by him and other members in the senate , had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for the war . <end>
<start> Haec in contione questus ex provincia fugit . <end>$$<start> After having made these complaints in a public assembly , he fled from his province . <end>
<start> Nacti vacuas ab imperiis Sardiniam Valerius , Curio Siciliam , cum exercitibus eo perveniunt . <end>$$<start> Valerius found Sardinia , and Curio , Sicily , deserted by their governors when they arrived there with their armies . <end>
<start> Tubero cum in Africam venisset , invenit in provincia cum imperio Attium Varum ; qui ad Auximum , ut supra demonstravimus , amissis cohortibus protinus ex fuga in Africam pervenerat atque eam sua sponte vacuam occupaverat delectuque habito duas legiones effecerat , hominum et locorum notitia et usu eius provinciae nactus aditus ad ea conanda , quod paucis ante annis ex praetura eam provinciam obtinuerat . <end>$$<start> From his acquaintance with the people and country , and his knowledge of that province , he found the means of effecting this ; because a few years before , at the expiration of his praetorship , he had obtained that province . <end>
<start> His rebus confectis Caesar , ut reliquum tempus a labore intermitteretur , milites in proxima municipia deducit ; ipse ad urbem proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> When these affairs were dispatched , Caesar , that there might be an intermission from labor for the rest of the season , drew off his soldiers to the nearest municipal towns , and set off in person for Rome . <end>
<start> Coacto senatu iniurias inimicorum commemorat Docet se nullum extraordinarium honorem appetisse , sed exspectato legitimo tempore consulatus eo fuisse contentum , quod omnibus civibus pateret . <end>$$<start> Having assembled the senate , he reminded them of the injustice of his enemies ; and told them , That he aimed at no extraordinary honor , but had waited for the time appointed by law , for standing candidate for the consulate , being contented with what was allowed to every citizen . <end>
<start> Latum ab X tribunis plebis contradicentibus inimicis , Catone vero acerrime repugnante et pristina consuetudine dicendi mora dies extrahente , ut sui ratio absentis haberetur , ipso consule Pompeio ; qui si improbasset , cur ferri passus esset ? Si probasset , cur se uti populi beneficio prohibuisset ? Patientiam proponit suam , cum de exercitibus dimittendis ultro postulavisset ; in quo iacturam dignitatis atque honoris ipse facturus esset . <end>$$<start> That a bill had been carried by the ten tribunes of the people (notwithstanding the resistance of his enemies , and a very violent opposition from Cato , who in his usual manner , consumed the day by a tedious harangue) that he should be allowed to stand candidate , though absent , even in the consulship of Pompey ; and if the latter disapproved of the bill , why did he allow it to pass ? if he approved of it , why should he debar him Caesar from the people's favor ? He made mention of his own patience , in that he had freely proposed that all armies should be disbanded , by which he himself would suffer the loss both of dignity and honor . <end>
<start> Acerbitatem inimicorum docet , qui , quod ab altero postularent , in se recusarent , atque omnia permisceri mallent , quam imperium exercitusque dimittere . <end>$$<start> He urged the virulence of his enemies , who refused to comply with what they required from others , and had rather that all things should be thrown into confusion , than that they should lose their power and their armies . <end>
<start> Iniuriam in eripiendis legionibus praedicat , crudelitatem et insolentiam in circumscribendis tribunis plebis ; condiciones a se latas , expetita colloquia et denegata commemorat . <end>$$<start> He expatiated on their injustice , in taking away his legions : their cruelty and insolence in abridging the privileges of the tribunes ; the proposals he had made , and his entreaties of an interview which had been refused him . <end>
<start> Pro quibus rebus hortatur ac postulat , ut rem publicam suscipiant atque una secum administrent . <end>$$<start> For which reasons , he begged and desired that they would undertake the management of the republic , and unite with him in the administration of it . <end>
<start> Sin timore defugiant , illis se oneri non futurum et per se rem publicam administraturum . <end>$$<start> But if through fear they declined it , he would not be a burden to them , but take the management of it on himself . <end>
<start> Legatos ad Pompeium de compositione mitti oportere , neque se reformidare , quod in senatu Pompeius paulo ante dixisset , ad quos legati mitterentur , his auctoritatem attribui timoremque eorum , qui mitterent significari . <end>$$<start> That deputies ought to be sent to Pompey , to propose a reconciliation ; as he did not regard what Pompey had lately asserted in the senate , that authority was acknowledged to be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were sent , and fear implied in those that sent them . <end>
<start> Tenuis atque infirmi haec animi videri Se vero , ut operibus anteire studuerit , sic iustitia et aequitate velle superare . <end>$$<start> That these were the sentiments of low , weak minds : that for his part , as he had made it his study to surpass others in glory , so he was desirous of excelling them in justice and equity . <end>
<start> Probat rem senatus de mittendis legatis : sed , qui mitterentur , non reperiebantur , maximeque timoris causa pro se quisque id munus legationis recusabat . <end>$$<start> The senate approved of sending deputies , but none could be found fit to execute the commission : for every person , from his own private fears , declined the office . <end>
<start> Pompeius enim discedens ab urbe in senatu dixerat eodem se habiturum loco , qui Romae remansissent et qui in castris Caesaris fuissent . <end>$$<start> For Pompey , on leaving the city , had declared in the open senate , that he would hold in the same degree of estimation , those who staid in Rome and those in Caesar's camp . <end>
<start> Sic triduum disputationibus excusationibusque extrahitur . <end>$$<start> Thus three days were wasted in disputes and excuses . <end>
<start> Subicitur etiam Lucius Metellus , tribunus plebis , ab inimicis Caesaris , qui hanc rem distrahat , reliquasque res , quascumque agere instituerit , impediat . <end>$$<start> Besides , Lucius Metellus , one of the tribunes , was suborned by Caesar's enemies , to prevent this , and to embarrass every thing else which Caesar should propose . <end>
<start> Cuius cognito consilio Caesar frustra diebus aliquot consumptis , ne reliquum tempus amittat , infectis eis , quae agere destinaverat , ab urbe proficiscitur atque in ulteriorem Galliam pervenit . <end>$$<start> Caesar having discovered his intention , after spending several days to no purpose , left the city , in order that he might not lose any more time , and went to Transalpine Gaul , without effecting what he had intended . <end>
<start> Quo cum venisset , cognoscit missum a Pompeio Vibullium Rufum , quem paucis ante diebus Corfinio captum ipse dimiserat ; profectum item Domitium ad occupandam Massiliam navibus actuariis septem , quas Igilii et in Cosano a privatis coactas servis , libertis , colonis suis compleverat ; praemissos etiam legatos Massilienses domum , nobiles adulescentes , quos ab urbe discedens Pompeius erat adhortatus , ne nova Caesaris officia veterum suorum beneficiorum in eos memoriam expellerent . <end>$$<start> On his arrival there , he was informed that Vibullius Rufus , whom he had taken a few days before at Corfinium , and set at liberty , was sent by Pompey into Spain ; and that Domitius also was gone to seize Massilia with seven row-galleys , which were fitted up by some private persons at Igilium and Cosa , and which he had manned with his own slaves , freedmen , and colonists : and that some young noble men of Massilia had been sent before him ; whom Pompey , when leaving Rome had exhorted , that the late services of Caesar should not erase from their minds the memory of his former favors . <end>
<start> Quibus mandatis acceptis Massilienses portas Caesari clauserant ; Albicos , barbaros homines , qui in eorum fide antiquitus erant montesque supra Massiliam incolebant , ad se vocaverant ; frumentum ex finitimis regionibus atque ex omnibus castellis in urbem convexerant ; armorum officinas in urbe instituerant ; muros portas classem reficiebant . <end>$$<start> On receiving this message , the Massilians had shut their gates against Caesar , and invited over to them the Albici , who had formerly been in alliance with them , and who inhabited the mountains that overhung Massilia : they had likewise conveyed the corn from the surrounding country , and from all the forts into the city ; had opened armories in the city ; and were repairing the walls , the fleet , and the gates . <end>
<start> Quare paribus eorum beneficiis parem se quoque voluntatem tribuere debere et neutrum eorum contra alterum iuvare aut urbe aut portibus recipere . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , having received equal favors from both , they ought to show equal affection to both , and assist neither against the other , nor admit either into their city or harbors . <end>
<start> Haec dum inter eos aguntur , Domitius navibus Massiliam pervenit atque ab eis receptus urbi praeficitur ; summa ei belli administrandi permittitur . <end>$$<start> While this treaty was going forward , Domitius arrived at Massilia with his fleet , and was received into the city , and made governor of it . <end>
<start> Quibus iniuriis permotus Caesar legiones tres Massiliam adducit ; turres vineasque ad oppugnationem urbis agere , naves longas Arelate numero XII facere instituit . <end>$$<start> At his command they send the fleet to all parts ; they seize all the merchantmen they could meet with , and carry them into the harbor ; they apply the nails , timber , and rigging , with which they were furnished to rig and refit their other vessels . <end>
<start> Quibus effectis armatisque diebus XXX , a qua die materia caesa est , adductisque Massiliam his D . <end>$$<start> They lay up in the public stores , all the corn that was found in the ships , and reserve the rest of their lading and convoy for the siege of the town , should such an event take place . <end>
<start> Dum haec parat atque administrat , Gaius Fabium legatum cum legionibus III , quas Narbone circumque ea loca hiemandi causa disposuerat , in Hispaniam praemittit celeriterque saltus Pyrenaeos occupari iubet , qui eo tempore ab Lucius Afranio legato praesidiis tenebantur . <end>$$<start> While he was preparing and getting these things in readiness , he sent Caius Fabius one of his lieutenants into Spain with three legions , which he had disposed to winter quarters in Narbo , and the neighboring country ; and ordered him immediately to seize the passes of the Pyrenees , which were at that time occupied by detachments from Lucius Afranius , one of Pompey's lieutenants . <end>
<start> Reliquas legiones , quae longius hiemabant , subsequi iubet . <end>$$<start> He desired the other legions , which were passing the winter at a great distance , to follow close after him . <end>
<start> Fabius , ut erat imperatum , adhibita celeritate praesidium ex saltu deiecit magnisque itineribus ad exercitum Afrani contendit . <end>$$<start> Fabius , according to his orders , by using expedition , dislodged the party from the hills , and by hasty marches came up with the army of Afranius . <end>

<start> His rebus constitutis equites auxiliaque toti Lusitaniae a Petreio , Celtiberiae , Cantabris barbarisque omnibus , qui ad Oceanum pertinent , ab Afranio imperantur . <end>$$<start> These matters being settled , reinforcements of horse and foot were demanded from Lusitania , by Petreius ; from the Celtiberi , Cantabri , and all the barbarous nations which border on the ocean , by Afranius . <end>
<start> Quibus coactis celeriter Petreius per Vettones ad Afranium pervenit , constituuntque communi consilio bellum ad Ilerdam propter ipsius opportunitatem gerere . <end>$$<start> They resolved by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity of Herba , on account of the advantages of its situation . <end>
<start> Erant , ut supra demonstratum est , legiones Afranii tres , Petreii duae , praeterea scutatae citerioris provinciae et caetratae ulterioris Hispaniae cohortes circiter LXXX equitumque utriusque provinciae circiter V milia . <end>$$<start> Afranius , as above mentioned , had three legions , Petreius two There were besides about eighty cohorts raised in Hither and Further Spain (of which , the troops belonging to the former province had shields , those of the latter targets) , and about five thousand horse raised in both provinces . <end>
<start> Audierat Pompeium per Mauretaniam cum legionibus iter in Hispaniam facere confestimque esse venturum . <end>$$<start> He had been informed that Pompey was marching through Mauritania with his legions to Spain , and would shortly arrive . <end>
<start> Simul a tribunis militum centurionibusque mutuas pecunias sumpsit ; has exercitui distribuit . <end>$$<start> He at the same time borrowed money from the tribunes and centurions , which he distributed among his soldiers . <end>
<start> Fabius finitimarum civitatum animos litteris nuntiisque temptabat . <end>$$<start> Fabius sounded the inclinations of the neighboring states by letters and messengers . <end>
<start> In Sicori flumine pontes effecerat duos distantes inter se milia passuum IIII . <end>$$<start> He had made two bridges over the river Segre , at the distance of four miles from each other . <end>
<start> His pontibus pabulatum mittebat , quod ea quae citra flumen fuerant , superioribus diebus consumpserat . <end>$$<start> He sent foraging parties over these bridges , because he had already consumed all the forage that was on his side of the river . <end>
<start> Hoc idem fere atque eadem de causa Pompeiani exercitus duces faciebant , crebroque inter se equestribus proeliis contendebant . <end>$$<start> The generals of Pompey's army did almost the same thing , and for the same reason : and the horse had frequent skirmishes with each other . <end>
<start> Huc cum cotidiana consuetudine congressae pabulatoribus praesidio propiore ponte legiones Fabianae duae flumen transissent , impedimentaque et omnis equitatus sequeretur , subito vi ventorum et aquae magnitudine pons est interruptus et reliqua multitudo equitum interclusa Quo cognito a Petreio et Afranio ex aggere atque cratibus , quae flumine ferebantur , celeriter suo ponte Afranius , quem oppido castrisque coniunctum habebat , legiones IIII equitatumque omnem traiecit duabusque Fabianis occurrit legionibus . <end>$$<start> When two of Fabius's legions had , as was their constant practice , gone forth as the usual protection to the foragers , and had crossed the river , and the baggage , and all the horse were following them , on a sudden , from the weight of the cattle , and the mass of water , the bridge fell , and all the horse were cut off from the main army , which being known to Petreius and Afranius , from the timber and hurdles that were carried down the river , Afranius immediately crossed his own bridge , which communicated between his camp and the town , with four legions and all the cavalry , and marched against Fabius's two legions . <end>
<start> Cuius adventu nuntiato Lucius Plancus , qui legionibus praeerat , necessaria re coactus locum capit superiorem diversamque aciem in duas partes constituit , ne ab equitatu circumveniri posset . <end>$$<start> When his approach was announced , Lucius Plancus , who had the command of those legions , compelled by the emergency , took post on a rising ground ; and drew up his army with two fronts , that it might not be surrounded by the cavalry . <end>
<start> Ita congressus impari numero magnos impetus legionum equitatusque sustinet . <end>$$<start> Thus , though engaged with superior numbers , he sustained the furious charge of the legions and the horse . <end>
<start> Commisso ab equitibus proelio signa legionum duarum procul ab utrisque conspiciuntur , quas Gaius Fabius ulteriore ponte subsidio nostris miserat suspicatus fore id , quod accidit , ut duces adversariorum occasione et beneficio fortunae ad nostros opprimendos uterentur . <end>$$<start> When the battle was begun by the horse , there were observed at a distance by both sides the colors of two legions , which Caius Fabius had sent round by the further bridge to reinforce our men , suspecting , as the event verified , that the enemy's generals would take advantage of the opportunity which fortune had put in their way , to attack our men . <end>
<start> Quarum adventu proelium dirimitur , ac suas uterque legiones reducit in castra . <end>$$<start> Their approach put an end to the battle , and each general led back his legions to their respective camps . <end>
<start> Eo biduo Caesar cum equitibus DCCCC , quos sibi praesidio reliquerat , in castra pervenit . <end>$$<start> In two days after Caesar came to the camp with nine hundred horse , which he had retained for a body guard . <end>
<start> Pons , qui fuerat tempestate interruptus , paene erat refectus ; hunc noctu perfici iussit . <end>$$<start> The bridge which had been broken down by the storm was almost repaired , and he ordered it to be finished in the night . <end>
<start> Ipse cognita locorum natura ponti castrisque praesidio sex cohortes reliquit atque omnia impedimenta et postero die omnibus copiis triplici instructa acie ad Ilerdam proficiscitur et sub castris Afranii constitit et ibi paulisper sub armis moratus facit aequo loco pugnandi potestatem . <end>$$<start> Being acquainted with the nature of the country , he left behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge , the camp , and all his baggage , and the next day set off in person for Ilerda , with all his forces drawn up in three lines , and halted just before the camp of Afranius , and having remained there a short time under arms , he offered him battle on equal terms . <end>
<start> Potestate facta Afranius copias educit et in medio colle sub castris constituit . <end>$$<start> When this affair was made , Afranius drew out his forces , and posted them on the middle of a hill , near his camp . <end>
<start> Caesar , ubi cognovit per Afranium stare , quo minus proelio dimicaretur , ab infimis radicibus montis intermissis circiter passibus CCCC castra facere constituit et , ne in opere faciundo milites repentino hostium incursu exterrerentur atque opere prohiberentur , vallo muniri vetuit , quod eminere et procul videri necesse erat , sed a fronte contra hostem pedum XV fossam fieri iussit . <end>$$<start> When Caesar perceived that Afranius declined coming to an engagement , he resolved to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile's distance from the very foot of the mountain ; and that his soldiers while engaged in their works , might not be terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy , or disturbed in their work , he ordered them not to fortify it with a wall , which must rise high , and be seen at a distance , but draw , on the front opposite the enemy , a trench fifteen feet broad . <end>
<start> Prima et secunda acies in armis , ut ab initio constituta erat , permanebat ; post has opus in occulto a III acie fiebat . <end>$$<start> The first and second lines confined under arms , as was from the first appointed . <end>
<start> Sic omne prius est perfectum , quam imtellegeretur ab Afranio castra muniri Sub vesperum Caesar intra hanc fossam legiones reducit atque ibi sub armis proxima nocte conquiescit . <end>$$<start> Behind them the third line was carrying on the work without being seen ; so that the whole was completed before Afranius discovered that the camp was being fortified . <end>
<start> Postero die omnem exercitum intra fossam continet et , quod longius erat agger petendus , in praesentia similem rationem operis instituit singulaque latera castrorum singulis attribuit legionibus munienda fossasque ad eandem magnitudinem perfici iubet ; reliquas legiones in armis expeditas contra hostem constituit . <end>$$<start> In the evening Caesar drew his legions within this trench , and rested them under arms the next night The day following he kept his whole army within it , and as it was necessary to bring materials from a considerable distance , he for the present pursued the same plan in his work ; and to each legion , one after the other , he assigned one side of the camp to fortify , and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be cut : he kept the rest of the legions under arms without baggage to oppose the enemy . <end>
<start> Afranius Petreiusque terrendi causa atque operis impediendi copias suas ad infimas montis radices producunt et proelio lacessunt , neque idcirco Caesar opus intermittit confisus praesidio legionum trium et munitione fossae . <end>$$<start> Caesar , however , did not interrupt his work , relying on the protection of the three legions , and the strength of the fosse . <end>
<start> Illi non diu commorati nec longius ab infimo colle progressi copias in castra reducunt . <end>$$<start> After staying for a short time , and advancing no great distance from the bottom of the hill , they led back their forces to their camp . <end>
<start> Erat inter oppidum Ilerdam et proximum collem , ubi castra Petreius atque Afranius habebant , planities circiter passuum CCC , atque in hoc fere medio spatio tumulus erat paulo editior ; quem si occupavisset Caesar et communisset , ab oppido et ponte et commeatu omni , quem in oppidum contulerant , se interclusurum adversarios confidebat . <end>$$<start> Between the town of Ilerda and the next hill , on which Afranius and Petreius were encamped , there was a plain about three hundred paces broad , and near the middle of it an eminence somewhat raised above the level : Caesar hoped that if he could get possession of this and fortify it , he should be able to cut off the enemy from the town , the bridge , and all the stores which they had laid up in the town . <end>
<start> Hoc sperans legiones III ex castris educit acieque in locis idoneis instructa unius legionis antesignanos procurrere atque eum tumulum occupare iubet . <end>$$<start> In expectation of this he led three legions out of the camp , and , drawing up his army in an advantageous position , he ordered the advanced men of one legion to hasten forward and seize the eminence . <end>
<start> Qua re cognita celeriter quae in statione pro castris erant Afranii cohortes breviore itinere ad eundem occupandum locum mittuntur . <end>$$<start> Upon intelligence of this the cohorts which were on guard before Afranius's camp were instantly sent a nearer way to occupy the same post . <end>
<start> Contenditur proelio , et quod prius in tumulum Afraniani venerant , nostri repelluntur atque aliis submissis subsidiis terga vertere seque ad signa legionum recipere coguntur . <end>$$<start> The two parties engage , and as Afranius's men had reached the eminence first , our men were repulsed , and , on a reinforcement being sent , they were obliged to turn their backs and retreat to the standards of legions . <end>
<start> Genus erat pugnae militum illorum , ut magno impetu primo procurrerent , audacter locum caperent , ordines suos non magnopere servarent , rari dispersique pugnarent ; si premerentur , pedem referre et loco excedere non turpe existimarent cum Lusitanis reliquisque barbaris barbaro genere quodam pugnae assuefacti ; quod fere fit , quibus quisque in locis miles inveteraverit , ut multum earum regionum consuetudine moveatur . <end>$$<start> The manner of fighting of those soldiers was to run forward with great impetuosity and boldly take a post , and not to keep their ranks strictly , but to fight in small scattered parties : if hard pressed they thought it no disgrace to retire and give up the post , being accustomed to this manner of fighting among the Lusitanians and other barbarous nations ; for it commonly happens that soldiers are strongly influenced by the customs of those countries in which they have spent much time . <end>
<start> Haec tum ratio nostros perturbavit insuetos huius generis pugnae : circumiri enim sese ab aperto latere procurrentibus singulis arbitrabantur ; ipsi autem suos ordines servare neque ab signis discedere neque sine gravi causa eum locum , quem ceperant , dimitti censuerant oportere . <end>$$<start> This method , however , alarmed our men , who were not used to such a description of warfare For they imagined that they were about to be surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who ran forward from their ranks ; and they thought it their duty to keep their ranks , and not to quit their colors , nor , without good reason to give up the post which they had taken . <end>
<start> Itaque perturbatis antesignanis legio , quae in eo cornu constiterat , locum non tenuit atque in proximum collem sese recepit . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , when the advanced guard gave way , the legion which was stationed on that wing did not keep its ground , but retreated to the next hill . <end>
<start> Caesar paene omni acie perterrita , quod praeter opinionem consuetudinemque acciderat , cohortatus suos legionem nonam subsidio ducit ; hostem insolenter atque acriter nostros insequentem supprimit rursusque terga vertere seque ad oppidum Ilerdam recipere et sub muro consistere cogit . <end>$$<start> Almost the whole army being daunted at this , because it had occurred contrary to their expectations and custom , Caesar encouraged his men and led the ninth legion to their relief , and checked the insolent and eager pursuit of the enemy , and obliged them , in their turn , to show their backs , and retreat to Ilerda , and take post under the walls . <end>
<start> Sed nonae legionis milites elati studio , dum sarcire acceptum detrimentum volunt , temere insecuti longius fugientes in locum iniquum progrediuntur et sub montem , in quo erat oppidum positum Ilerda , succedunt . <end>$$<start> But the soldiers of the ninth legion , being over zealous to repair the dishonor which had been sustained , having rashly pursued the fleeing enemy , advanced into disadvantageous ground and went up to the foot of the mountain on which the town Ilerda was built . <end>
<start> Hinc se recipere cum vellent , rursus illi ex loco superiore nostros premebant . <end>$$<start> And when they wished to retire they were again attacked by the enemy from the rising ground . <end>
<start> Praeruptus locus erat utraque ex parte derectus ac tantum in latitudinem patebat , ut tres instructae cohortes eum locum explerent , ut neque subsidia ab lateribus submitti neque equites laborantibus usui esse possent . <end>$$<start> The place was craggy in the front and steep on either side , and was so narrow that even three cohorts , drawn up in order of battle , would fill it ; but no relief could be sent on the flanks , and the horse could be of no service to them when hard pressed . <end>
<start> Ab oppido autem declivis locus tenui fastigio vergebat in longitudinem passuum circiter CCCC . <end>$$<start> From the town , indeed , the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near four hundred paces . <end>
<start> Augebatur illis copia , atque ex castris cohortes per oppidum crebro submittebantur , ut integri defessis succederent . <end>$$<start> The enemy's forces were increasing , and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from the camp through the town , that fresh men might relieve the weary . <end>
<start> Hoc idem Caesar facere cogebatur , ut submissis in eundem locum cohortibus defessos reciperet . <end>$$<start> Caesar was obliged to do the same , and relieve the fatigued by sending cohorts to that post . <end>
<start> Hoc cum esset modo pugnatum continenter horis quinque nostrique gravius a multitudine premerentur , consumptis omnibus telis gladiis destrictis impetum adversus montem in cohortes faciunt , paucisque deiectis reliquos sese convertere cogunt . <end>$$<start> After the battle had in this manner continued incessantly for five hours , and our men had suffered much from superior numbers , having spent all their javelins , they drew their swords and charged the enemy up the hill , and , having killed a few , obliged the rest to fly . <end>
<start> Submotis sub murum cohortibus ac nonnullam partem propter terrorem in oppidum compulsis facilis est nostris receptus datus . <end>$$<start> The cohorts being beaten back to the wall , and some being driven by their fears into the town , an easy retreat was afforded to our men . <end>
<start> Equitatus autem noster ab utroque latere , etsi deiectis atque inferioribus locis constiterat , tamen summa in iugum virtute connititur atque inter duas acies perequitans commodiorem ac tutiorem nostris receptum dat . <end>$$<start> Our cavalry also , on either flank , though stationed on sloping or low ground , yet bravely struggled up to the top of the hill , and , riding between the two armies , made our retreat more easy and secure . <end>
<start> Ita vario certamine pugnatum est . <end>$$<start> Such were the various turns of fortune in the battle . <end>
<start> Nostri in primo congressu circiter LXX ceciderunt , in his Quintus Fulginius ex primo hastato legionis XIIII , qui propter eximiam virtutem ex inferioribus ordinibus in eum locum pervenerat ; vulnerantur amplius DC . <end>$$<start> In the first encounter about seventy of our men fell : among them Quintus Fulgenius , first centurion of the second line of the fourteenth legion , who , for his extraordinary valor , had been promoted from the lower ranks to that post . <end>
<start> Ex Afranianis interficiuntur Titus Caecilius , primi pili centurio , et praeter eum centuriones IIII , milites amplius CC . <end>$$<start> About six hundred were wounded Of Afranius's party there were killed Titus Caecilius , principal centurion , and four other centurions , and above two hundred men . <end>
<start> Sed haec eius diei praefertur opinio , ut se utrique superiores discessisse existimarent : Afraniani , quod , cum esse omnium iudicio inferiores viderentur , comminus tam diu stetissent et nostrorum impetum sustinuissent et initio locum tumulumque tenuissent , quae causa pugnandi fuerat , et nostros primo congressu terga vertere coegissent ; nostri autem , quod iniquo loco atque impari congressi numero quinque horis proelium sustinuissent , quod montem gladiis destrictis ascendissent , quod ex loco superiore terga vertere adversarios coegissent atque in oppidum compulissent . <end>$$<start> But this opinion is spread abroad concerning this day , that each party thought that they came off conquerors Afranius's soldiers , because , though they were esteemed inferior in the opinion of all , yet they had stood our attack and sustained our charge , and , at first , had kept the post on the hill which had been the occasion of the dispute ; and , in the first encounter , had obliged our men to fly : but ours , because , notwithstanding the disadvantage of the ground and the disparity of numbers , they had maintained the battle for five hours , had advanced up the hill sword in hand , and had forced the enemy to fly from the higher ground and driven them into the town . <end>
<start> Illi eum tumulum , pro quo pugnatum est , magnis operibus munierunt praesidiumque ibi posuerunt . <end>$$<start> The enemy fortified the hill , about which the contest had been , with strong works and posted a garrison on it . <end>
<start> Accidit etiam repentinum incommodum biduo , quo haec gesta sunt . <end>$$<start> In two days after this transaction , there happened an unexpected misfortune . <end>
<start> Tanta enim tempestas cooritur , ut numquam illis locis maiores aquas fuisse constaret Tum autem ex omnibus montibus nives proluit ac summas ripas fluminis superavit pontesque ambo , quos Gaius Fabius fecerat , uno die interrupit . <end>$$<start> For so great a storm arose , that it was agreed that there were never seen higher floods in those countries ; it swept down the snow from all the mountains , and broke over the banks of the river , and in one day carried away both the bridges which Fabius had built- a circumstance which caused great difficulties to Caesar's army . <end>
<start> Castra enim , ut supra demonstratum est , cum essent inter flumina duo , Sicorim et Cingam , spatio milium XXX , neutrum horum transiri poterat , necessarioque omnes his angustiis continebantur . <end>$$<start> Neither could the states , which had espoused Caesar's cause , furnish him with corn , nor the troops , which had gone far to forage , return , as they were stopped by the waters : nor could the convoys , coming from Italy and Gaul , make their way to the camp . <end>
<start> Neque civitates , quae ad Caesaris amicitiam accesserant , frumentum supportare , neque ei , qui pabulatum longius progressi erant , interclusi fluminibus reverti neque maximi commeatus , qui ex Italia Galliaque veniebant , in castra pervenire poterant . <end>$$<start> Besides , it was the most distressing season of the year , when there was no corn in the blade , and it was nearly ripe : and the states were exhausted , because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn , before Caesar's arrival , into Ilerda , and whatever he had left , had been already consumed by Caesar . <end>
<start> Qui erant pabulandi aut frumentandi causa progressi , hos levis armaturae Lusitani peritique earum regionum cetrati citerioris Hispaniae consectabantur ; quibus erat proclive tranare flumen , quod consuetudo eorum omnium est , ut sine utribus ad exercitum non eant . <end>$$<start> They who had gone out to get forage or corn , were chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians , and the targeteers of Hither Spain , who were well acquainted with the country , and could readily swim across the river , because it is the custom of all those people not to join their armies without bladders . <end>
<start> At exercitus Afranii omnium rerum abundabat copia Multum erat frumentum provisum et convectum superioribus temporibus , multum ex omni provincia comportabatur ; magna copia pabuli suppetebat . <end>$$<start> But Afranius's army had abundance of everything ; a great stock of corn had been provided and laid in long before , a large quantity was coming in from the whole province : they had a good store of forage . <end>
<start> Harum omnium rerum facultates sine ullo periculo pons Ilerdae praebebat et loca trans flumen integra , quo omnino Caesar adire non poterat . <end>$$<start> The bridge of Ilerda afforded an opportunity of getting all these without any danger , and the places beyond the bridge , to which Caesar had no access , were as yet untouched . <end>
<start> Hae permanserunt aquae dies complures . <end>$$<start> Those floods continued several days . <end>
<start> Conatus est Caesar reficere pontes ; sed nec magnitudo fluminis permittebat , neque ad ripam dispositae cohortes adversariorum perfici patiebantur Quod illis prohibere erat facile cum ipsius fluminis natura atque aquae magnitudine , tum quod ex totis ripis in unum atque angustum locum tela iaciebantur ; atque erat difficile eodem tempore rapidissimo flumine opera perficere et tela vitare . <end>$$<start> Caesar endeavored to repair the bridges , but the height of the water did not allow him : and the cohorts disposed along the banks did not suffer them to be completed ; and it was easy for them to prevent it , both from the nature of the river and the height of the water , but especially because their darts were thrown from the whole course of the bank on one confined spot ; and it was no easy matter at one and the same time to execute a work in a very rapid flood , and to avoid the darts . <end>
<start> Nuntiatur Afranio magnos commeatus , qui iter habebant ad Caesarem , ad flumen constitisse . <end>$$<start> Intelligence was brought to Afranius that the great convoys , which were on their march to Caesar , had halted at the river . <end>
<start> Venerant eo sagittarii ex Rutenis , equites ex Gallia cum multis carris magnisque impedimentis , ut fert Gallica consuetudo Erant praeterea cuiusque generis hominum milia circiter VI cum servis liberisque ; sed nullus ordo , nullum imperium certum , cum suo quisque consilio uteretur atque omnes sine timore iter facerent usi superiorum temporum atque itinerum licentia . <end>$$<start> Archers from the Rutheni , and horse from the Gauls , with a long train of baggage , according to the Gallic custom of traveling , had arrived there ; there were besides about six thousand people of all descriptions , with slaves and freed men . <end>
<start> Erant complures honesti adulescentes , senatorum filii et ordinis equestris ; erant legationes civitatum ; erant legati Caesaris . <end>$$<start> But there was no order , or regular discipline , as every one followed his own humor , and all traveled without apprehension , taking the same liberty as on former marches . <end>
<start> Ei , dum pari certamine res geri potuit , magnum hostium numerum pauci sustinuere ; sed ubi signa legionum appropinquare coeperunt , paucis amissis sese in proximos montes conferunt . <end>$$<start> Though but few , they withstood the vast number of the enemy , as long as they fought on equal terms ; but when the legions began to approach , having lost a few men , they retreated to the next mountains . <end>
<start> Hoc pugnae tempus magnum attulit nostris ad salutem momentum ; nacti enim spatium se in loca superiora receperunt . <end>$$<start> The delay occasioned by this battle was of great importance to the security of our men ; for having gained time , they retired to the higher grounds . <end>
<start> Desiderati sunt eo die sagittarii circiter CC , equites pauci , calonum atque impedimentorum non magnus numerus . <end>$$<start> There were missing that day about two hundred bow-men , a few horse , and an inconsiderable number of servants and baggage . <end>
<start> His tamen omnibus annona crevit ; quae fere res non solum inopia praesentis , sed etiam futuri temporis timore ingravescere consuevit . <end>$$<start> However , by all these things , the price of provisions was raised , which is commonly a disaster attendant , not only on a time of present scarcity , but on the apprehension of future want . <end>
<start> Haec Afranius Petreiusque et eorum amici pleniora etiam atque uberiora Romam ad suos perscribebant ; multa rumor affingebat , ut paene bellum confectum videretur . <end>$$<start> Afranius and Petreius , and their friends , sent fuller and more circumstantial accounts of these things to Rome , to their acquaintances . <end>
<start> Quibus litteris nuntiisque Romam perlatis magni domum concursus ad Afranium magnaeque gratulationes fiebant ; multi ex Italia ad Gnaeus Pompeium proficiscebantur , alii , ut principes talem nuntium attulisse , alii ne eventum belli exspectasse aut ex omnibus novissimi venisse viderentur . <end>$$<start> Report exaggerated them so that the war appeared to be almost at an end When these letters and dispatches were received at Rome , a great concourse of people resorted to the house of Afranius , and congratulations ran high ; several went out of Italy to Cneius Pompey ; some of them , to be the first to bring him the intelligence ; others , that they might not be thought to have waited the issue of the war , and to have come last of all . <end>
<start> Cum in his angustiis res esset , atque omnes viae ab Afranianis militibus equitibusque obsiderentur , nec pontes perfici possent , imperat militibus Caesar , ut naves faciant , cuius generis eum superioribus annis usus Britanniae docuerat . <end>$$<start> When Caesar's affairs were in this unfavorable position , and all the passes were guarded by the soldiers and horse of Afranius , and the bridges could not be prepared , Caesar ordered his soldiers to make ships of the kind that his knowledge of Britain a few years before had taught him . <end>
<start> Carinae ac prima statumina ex levi materia fiebant ; reliquum corpus navium viminibus contextum coriis integebatur . <end>$$<start> First , the keels and ribs were made of light timber , then , the rest of the hulk of the ships was wrought with wicker work , and covered over with hides . <end>
<start> Has perfectas carris iunctis devehit noctu milia passuum a castris XXII militesque his navibus flumen transportat continentemque ripae collem improviso occupat . <end>$$<start> When these were finished , he drew them down to the river in wagons in one night , a distance of twenty-two miles from his camp , and transported in them some soldiers across the river , and on a sudden took possession of a hill adjoining the bank . <end>
<start> Hunc celeriter , priusquam ab adversariis sentiatur , communit . <end>$$<start> This he immediately fortified , before he was perceived by the enemy . <end>
<start> Huc legionem postea traicit atque ex utraque parte pontem instituit , biduo perficit . <end>$$<start> To this he afterward transported a legion : and having begun a bridge on both sides , he finished it in two days . <end>
<start> Ita commeatus et qui frumenti causa processerant tuto ad se recipit et rem frumentariam expedire incipit . <end>$$<start> By this means , he brought safe to his camp , the convoys , and those who had gone out to forage ; and began to prepare a conveyance for the provisions . <end>
<start> Eodem die equitum magnam partem flumen traiecit Qui inopinantes pabulatores et sine ullo dissipatos timore aggressi magnum numerum iumentorum atque hominum intercipiunt cohortibusque cetratis subsidio missis scienter in duas partes sese distribuunt , alii ut praedae praesidio sint , alii ut venientibus resistant atque eos propellant , unamque cohortem , quae temere ante ceteras extra aciem procurrerat , seclusam ab reliquis circumveniunt atque interficiunt incolumesque cum magna praeda eodem ponte in castra revertuntur . <end>$$<start> The same day he made a great part of his horse pass the river , who , falling on the foragers by surprise as they were dispersed without any suspicions , intercepted an incredible number of cattle and people ; and when some Spanish light-armed cohorts were sent to reinforce the enemy , our men judiciously divided themselves into two parts , the one to protect the spoil , the other to resist the advancing foe , and to beat them back , and they cut off from the rest and surrounded one cohort , which had rashly ventured out of the line before the others , and after putting it to the sword , returned safe with considerable booty to the camp over the same bridge . <end>
<start> Dum haec ad Ilerdam geruntur , Massilienses usi Lucius Domitii consilio naves longas expediunt numero XVII , quarum erant XI tectae . <end>$$<start> While these affairs are going forward at Ilerda , the Massilians , adopting the advice of Domitius , prepared seventeen ships of war , of which eleven were decked . <end>
<start> Multa huc minora navigia addunt , ut ipsa multitudine nostra classis terreatur Magnum numerum sagittariorum , magnum Albicorum , de quibus supra demonstratum est , imponunt atque hos praemiis pollicitationibusque incitant . <end>$$<start> To these they add several smaller vessels , that our fleet might be terrified by numbers ; they man them with a great number of archers and of the Albici , of whom mention has been already made , and these they incited by rewards and promises . <end>
<start> Certas sibi deposcit naves Domitius atque has colonis pastoribusque , quos secum adduxerat , complet . <end>$$<start> Domitius required certain ships for his own use , which he manned with colonists and shepherds , whom he had brought along with him . <end>
<start> Sic omnibus rebus instructa classe magna fiducia ad nostras naves procedunt , quibus praeerat D . <end>$$<start> A fleet being thus furnished with every necessary , he advanced with great confidence against our ships , commanded by Decimus Brutus . <end>
<start> Brutus Hae ad insulam , quae est contra Massiliam , stationes obtinebant . <end>$$<start> It was stationed at an island opposite to Massilia . <end>
<start> Erat multo inferior numero navium Brutus ; sed electos ex omnibus legionibus fortissimos viros , antesignanos , centuriones , Caesar ei classi attribuerat , qui sibi id muneris depoposcerant . <end>$$<start> Brutus was much inferior in number of ships ; but Caesar had appointed to that fleet the bravest men selected from all his legions , antesignani and centurions , who had requested to be employed in that service . <end>
<start> Hi manus ferreas atque harpagones paraverant magnoque numero pilorum , tragularum reliquorumque telorum se instruxerant . <end>$$<start> They had provided iron hooks and harpoons , and had furnished themselves with a vast number of javelins , darts , and missiles . <end>
<start> Ita cognito hostium adventu suas naves ex portu educunt , cum Massiliensibus confligunt . <end>$$<start> Thus prepared , and being apprised of the enemy's approach , they put out from the harbor , and engaged the Massilians . <end>
<start> Pugnatum est utrimque fortissime atque acerrime ; neque multum Albici nostris virtute cedebant , homines asperi et montani , exercitati in armis ; atque hi modo digressi a Massiliensibus recentem eorum pollicitationem animis continebant , pastoresque Domitii spe libertatis excitati sub oculis domini suam probare operam studebant . <end>$$<start> Both sides fought with great courage and resolution ; nor did the Albici , a hardy people , bred on the highlands and inured to arms , fall much short of our men in valor : and being lately come from the Massilians , they retained in their minds their recent promises : and the wild shepherds , encouraged by the hope of liberty , were eager to prove their zeal in the presence of their masters . <end>
<start> Ipsi Massilienses et celeritate navium et scientia gubernatorum confisi nostros eludebant impetusque eorum excipiebant et , quoad licebat latiore uti spatio , producta longius acie circumvenire nostros aut pluribus navibus adoriri singulas aut remos transcurrentes detergere , si possent , contendebant ; cum propius erat necessario ventum , ab scientia gubernatorum atque artificiis ad virtutem montanorum confugiebant . <end>$$<start> The Massilians themselves , confiding in the quickness of their ships , and the skill of their pilots , eluded ours , and evaded the shock , and as long as they were permitted by clear space , lengthening their line they endeavored to surround us , or to attack single ships with several of theirs , or to run across our ships , and carry away our oars , if possible ; but when necessity obliged them to come nearer , they had recourse , from the skill and art of the pilots , to the valor of the mountaineers . <end>
<start> Nostri cum minus exercitatis remigibus minusque peritis gubernatoribus utebantur , qui repente ex onerariis navibus erant producti neque dum etiam vocabulis armamentorum cognitis , tum etiam tarditate et gravitate navium impediebantur ; factae enim subito ex humida materia non eundem usum celeritatis habebant . <end>$$<start> But our men , not having such expert seamen , or skillful pilots , for they had been hastily drafted from the merchant ships , and were not yet acquainted even with the names of the rigging , were moreover impeded by the heaviness and slowness of our vessels , which having been built in a hurry and of green timber , were not so easily maneuvered . <end>
<start> Itaque , dum locus comminus pugnandi daretur , aequo animo singulas binis navibus obiciebant atque iniecta manu ferrea et retenta utraque nave diversi pugnabant atque in hostium naves transcendebant et magno numero Albicorum et pastorum interfecto partem navium deprimunt , nonnullas cum hominibus capiunt , reliquas in portum compellunt . <end>$$<start> Therefore , when Caesar's men had an opportunity of a close engagement , they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of theirs And throwing in the grappling-irons , and holding both ships fast , they fought on both sides of the deck , and boarded the enemy's ; and having killed numbers of the Albici and shepherds , they sank some of their ships , took others with the men on board , and drove the rest into the harbor . <end>
<start> Eo die naves Massiliensium cum eis , quae sunt captae , intereunt VIIII . <end>$$<start> That day the Massilians lost nine ships , including those that were taken . <end>
<start> Hoc primum Caesari ad Ilerdam nuntiatur ; simul perfecto ponte celeriter fortuna mutatur . <end>$$<start> When news of this battle was brought to Caesar at Ilerda , the bridge being completed at the same time , fortune soon took a turn . <end>
<start> Interim Oscenses et Calagurritani , qui erant Oscensibus contributi , mittunt ad eum legatos seseque imperata facturos pollicentur . <end>$$<start> In the mean time the Oscenses and the Calagurritani , who were under the government of the Oscenses , send embassadors to Caesar , and offer to submit to his orders . <end>
<start> Hos Tarraconenses et Iacetani et Ausetani et paucis post diebus Illurgavonenses , qui flumen Hiberum attingunt , insequuntur . <end>$$<start> They are followed by the Tarraconenses , Jacetani , and Ausetani , and in a few days more by the Illurgavonenses , who dwell near the river Ebro . <end>
<start> Petit ab his omnibus , ut se frumento iuvent Pollicentur atque omnibus undique conquisitis iumentis in castra deportant . <end>$$<start> He requires of them all , to assist him with corn , to which they agreed , and having collected all the cattle in the country , they convey them into his camp . <end>
<start> Transit etiam cohors Illurgavonensis ad eum cognito civitatis consilio et signa ex statione transfert . <end>$$<start> One entire cohort of the Illurgavonenses , knowing the design of their state , came over to Caesar , from the place where they were stationed , and carried their colors with them . <end>
<start> Magna celeriter commutatio rerum . <end>$$<start> A great change is shortly made in the face of affairs . <end>
<start> Perfecto ponte , magnis quinque civitatibus ad amicitiam adiunctis , expedita re frumentaria , exstinctis rumoribus de auxiliis legionum , quae cum Pompeio per Mauritaniam venire dicebantur , multae longinquiores civitates ab Afranio desciscunt et Caesaris amicitiam sequuntur . <end>$$<start> The bridge being finished , five powerful states being joined to Caesar , a way opened for the receiving of corn , and the rumors of the assistance of legions which were said to be on their march , with Pompey at their head , through Mauritania , having died away , several of the more distant states revolt from Afranius , and enter into league with Caesar . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus perterritis animis adversariorum Caesar , ne semper magno circuitu per pontem equitatus esset mittendus , nactus idoneum locum fossas pedum XXX in latitudinem complures facere instituit , quibus partem aliquam Sicoris averteret vadumque in eo flumine efficeret . <end>$$<start> While the spirits of the enemy were dismayed at these things , Caesar , that he might not be always obliged to send his horse a long circuit round by the bridge , having found a convenient place , began to sink several drains , thirty feet deep , by which he might draw off a part of the river Segre , and make a ford over it . <end>
<start> His paene effectis magnum in timorem Afranius Petreiusque perveniunt , ne omnino frumento pabuloque intercluderentur , quod multum Caesar equitatu valebat . <end>$$<start> When these were almost finished , Afranius and Petreius began to be greatly alarmed , lest they should be altogether cut off from corn and forage , because Caesar was very strong in cavalry . <end>
<start> Itaque constituunt illis locis excedere et in Celtiberiam bellum transferre . <end>$$<start> They therefore resolved to quit their posts , and to transfer the war to Celtiberia . <end>
<start> Huic consilio suffragabatur etiam illa res , quod ex duobus contrariis generibus , quae superiore bello cum Sertorio steterant civitates , victae nomen atque imperium absentis Pompei timebant , quae in amicitia manserant , magnis affectae beneficiis eum diligebant ; Caesaris autem erat in barbaris nomen obscurius . <end>$$<start> There was , moreover , a circumstance that confirmed them in this resolution : for of the two adverse parties , that , which had stood by Sertorius in the late war , being conquered by Pompey , still trembled at his name and sway , though absent : the other which had remained firm in Pompey's interest , loved him for the favors which they had received : but Caesar's name was not known to the barbarians . <end>
<start> Hic magnos equitatus magnaque auxilia exspectabant et suis locis bellum in hiemem ducere cogitabant . <end>$$<start> From these they expected considerable aid , both of horse and foot , and hoped to protract the war till winter , in a friendly country . <end>
<start> Hoc inito consilio toto flumine Hibero naves conquiri et Octogesam adduci iubent Id erat oppidum positum ad Hiberum miliaque passuum a castris aberat XXX . <end>$$<start> Having come to this resolution , they gave orders to collect all the ships in the river Ebro , and to bring them to Octogesa , a town situated on the river Ebro , about twenty miles distant from their camp . <end>
<start> Ad eum locum fluminis navibus iunctis pontem imperant fieri legionesque duas flumen Sicorim traducunt , castraque muniunt vallo pedum XII . <end>$$<start> At this part of the river , they ordered a bridge to be made of boats fastened together , and transported two legions over the river Segre , and fortified their camp with a rampart , twelve feet high . <end>
<start> Qua re per exploratores cognita summo labore militum Caesar continuato diem noctemque opere in flumine avertendo huc iam rem deduxerat , ut equites , etsi difficulter atque aegre fiebat , possent tamen atque auderent flumen transire , pedites vero tantummodo umeris ac summo pectore exstarent et cum altitudine aquae tum etiam rapiditate fluminis ad transeundum impedirentur . <end>$$<start> Notice of this being given by the scouts , Caesar continued his work day and night , with very great fatigue to the soldiers , to drain the river , and so far effected his purpose , that the horse were both able and bold enough , though with some difficulty and danger , to pass the river ; but the foot had only their shoulders and upper part of their breast above the water , so that their fording it was retarded , not only by the depth of the water , but also by the rapidity of the current . <end>
<start> Sed tamen eodem fere tempore pons in Hibero prope effectus nuntiabatur , et in Sicori vadum reperiebatur . <end>$$<start> However , almost at the same instant , news was received of the bridge being nearly completed over the Ebro , and a ford was found in the Segre . <end>
<start> Iam vero eo magis illi maturandum iter existimabant . <end>$$<start> Now indeed the enemy began to think that they ought to hasten their march . <end>
<start> Itaque duabus auxiliaribus cohortibus Ilerdae praesidio relictis omnibus copiis Sicorim transeunt et cum duabus legionibus , quas superioribus diebus traduxerant , castra coniungunt . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , leaving two auxiliary cohorts in the garrison at Ilerda , they crossed the Segre with their whole force , and formed one camp with the two legions which they had led across a few days before . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur Caesari nihil , nisi uti equitatu agmen adversariorum male haberet et carperet Pons enim ipsius magnum circuitum habebat , ut multo breviore itinere illi ad Hiberum pervenire possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar had no resource , but to annoy and cut down their rear ; since with his cavalry to go by the bridge , required him to take a long circuit ; so that they would arrive at the Ebro by a much shorter route . <end>
<start> Equites ab eo missi flumen transeunt et , cum de tertia vigilia Petreius atque Afranius castra movissent , repente sese ad novissimum agmen ostendunt et magna multitudine circumfusa morari atque iter impedire incipiunt . <end>$$<start> The horse , which he had detached , crossed the ford , and when Afranius and Petreius had broken up their camp about the third watch , they suddenly appeared on their rear , and spreading round them in great numbers , retard and impede their march . <end>
<start> Prima luce ex superioribus locis , quae Caesaris castris erant coniuncta , cernebatur equitatus nostri proelio novissimos illorum premi vehementer ac nonnumquam sustineri extremum agmen atque interrumpi , alias inferri signa et universarum cohortium impetu nostros propelli , dein rursus conversos insequi . <end>$$<start> At break of day , it was perceived from the rising grounds which joined Caesar's camp , that their rear was vigorously pressed by our horse ; that the last line sometimes halted and was broken ; at other times , that they joined battle and that our men were beaten back by a general charge of their cohorts , and , in their turn , pursued them when they wheeled about : but through the whole camp the soldiers gathered in parties , and declared their chagrin that the enemy had been suffered to escape from their hands and that the war had been unnecessarily protracted . <end>
<start> Totis vero castris milites circulari et dolere hostem ex manibus dimitti , bellum non necessario longius duci ; centuriones tribunosque militum adire atque obsecrare , ut per eos Caesar certior fieret , ne labori suo neu periculo parceret ; paratos esse sese , posse et audere ea transire flumen , qua traductus esset equitatus . <end>$$<start> They applied to their tribunes and centurions , and entreated them to inform Caesar that he need not spare their labor or consider their danger ; that they were ready and able , and would venture to ford the river where the horse had crossed . <end>
<start> Quorum studio et vocibus excitatus Caesar , etsi timebat tantae magnitudini fluminis exercitum obicere , conandum tamen atque experiendum iudicat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , encouraged by their zeal and importunity , though he felt reluctant to expose his army to a river so exceedingly large , yet judged it prudent to attempt it and make a trial . <end>
<start> Itaque infirmiores milites ex omnibus centuriis deligi iubet , quorum aut animus aut vires videbantur sustinere non posse Hos cum legione una praesidio castris relinquit ; reliquas legiones expeditas educit magnoque numero iumentorum in flumine supra atque infra constituto traducit exercitum . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , he ordered all the weaker soldiers , whose spirit or strength seemed unequal to the fatigue , to be selected from each century , and left them , with one legion besides , to guard the camp : the rest of the legions he drew out without any baggage , and , having disposed a great number of horses in the river , above and below the ford , he led his army over . <end>
<start> Pauci ex his militibus abrepti vi fluminis ab equitatu excipiuntur ac sublevantur ; interit tamen nemo . <end>$$<start> A few of his soldiers being carried away by the force of the current , were stopped by the horse and taken up , and not a man perished . <end>
<start> Traducto incolumi exercitu copias instruit triplicemque aciem ducere incipit Ac tantum fuit in militibus studii , ut milium sex ad iter addito circuitu magnaque ad vadum fluminis mora interposita eos , qui de tertia vigilia exissent , ante horam diei VIIII consequerentur . <end>$$<start> His army being safe on the opposite bank , he drew out his forces and resolved to lead them forward in three battalions : and so great was the ardor of the soldiers that , notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six miles and a considerable delay in fording the river , before the ninth hour of the day they came up with those who had set out at the third watch . <end>
<start> Quos ubi Afranius procul visos cum Petreio conspexit , nova re perterritus locis superioribus constitit aciemque instruit . <end>$$<start> When Afranius , who was in company with Petreius , saw them at a distance , being affrighted at so unexpected a sight , he halted on a rising ground and drew up his army . <end>
<start> Illi necessario maturius , quam constituerant , castra ponunt Suberant enim montes , atque a milibus passuum V itinera difficilia atque angusta excipiebant . <end>$$<start> Caesar refreshed his army on the plain that he might not expose them to battle while fatigued ; and when the enemy attempted to renew their march , he pursued and stopped them . <end>
<start> Hos montes intrasse cupiebant , ut equitatum effugerent Caesaris praesidiisque in angustiis collocatis exercitum itinere prohiberent , ipsi sine periculo ac timore Hiberum copias traducerent . <end>$$<start> They were obliged to pitch their camp sooner than they had intended , for there were mountains at a small distance ; and difficult and narrow roads awaited them about five miles off . <end>
<start> Quod fuit illis conandum atque omni ratione efficiendum ; sed totius diei pugna atque itineris labore defessi rem in posterum diem distulerunt . <end>$$<start> They retired behind these mountains that they might avoid Caesar's cavalry , and , placing parties in the narrow roads , stop the progress of his army and lead their own forces across the Ebro without danger or apprehension . <end>
<start> Media circiter nocte eis , qui aquandi causa longius a castris processerant , ab equitibus correptis fit ab his certior Caesar duces adversariorum silentio copias castris educere . <end>$$<start> About midnight a few of their men who had gone some distance from the camp to fetch water , being taken by our horse , Caesar is informed by them that the generals of the enemy were drawing their troops out of the camp without noise . <end>
<start> Postero die Petreius cum paucis equitibus occulte ad exploranda loca proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> A similar movement was made from Caesar's camp . <end>
<start> Disputatur in consilio a Petreio atque Afranio et tempus profectionis quaeritur . <end>$$<start> There was a debate in the council between Afranius and Petreius , and the time of marching was the subject . <end>
<start> Quare omni ratione esse interdiu perrumpendum : etsi aliquo accepto detrimento , tamen summa exercitus salva locum , quem petant , capi posse . <end>$$<start> Wherefore they should , by all means , attempt to force their way by day ; for , though a trifling loss might be sustained , yet the post which they desired might be secured with safety to the main body of the army . <end>
<start> Nam quae itinera ad Hiberum atque Octogesam pertinebant castris hostium oppositis tenebantur . <end>$$<start> His soldiers were obliged to cross extensive and difficult valleys . <end>
<start> Ipsi erant transcendendae valles maximae ac difflcillimae ; saxa multis locis praerupta iter impediebant , ut arma per manus necessario traderentur , militesque inermes sublevatique alii ab aliis magnam partem itineris conficerent . <end>$$<start> Craggy cliffs , in several places , interrupted their march , insomuch that their arms had to be handed to one another , and the soldiers were forced to perform a great part of their march unarmed , and were lifted up the rocks by each other . <end>
<start> Sed hunc laborem recusabat nemo , quod eum omnium laborum finem fore existimabant , si hostem Hibero intercludere et frumento prohibere potuissent . <end>$$<start> But not a man murmured at the fatigue , because they imagined that there would be a period to all their toils , if they could cut off the enemy from the Ebro and intercept their convoys . <end>
<start> Ac primo Afraniani milites visendi causa laeti ex castris procurrebant contumeliosisque vocibus prosequebantur nostros : necessarii victus inopia coactos fugere atque ad Ilerdam reverti . <end>$$<start> At first , Afranius's soldiers ran in high spirits from their camp to look at us , and in contumelious language upbraided us , that we were forced , for want of necessary subsistence , to run away , and return to Ilerda . <end>
<start> Erat enim iter a proposito diversum , contrariamque in partem iri videbatur . <end>$$<start> For our route was different from what we proposed , and we appeared to be going a contrary way . <end>
<start> Duces vero eorum consilium suum laudibus efferebant , quod se castris tenuissent ; multumque eorum opinionem adiuvabat , quod sine iumentis impedimentisque ad iter profectos videbant , ut non posse inopiam diutius sustinere confiderent . <end>$$<start> But their generals applauded their own prudence in keeping within their camp , and it was a strong confirmation of their opinion , that they saw we marched without wagons or baggage , which made them confident that we could not long endure want . <end>
<start> Sed , ubi paulatim retorqueri agmen ad dextram conspexerunt iamque primos superare regionem castrorum animum adverterunt , nemo erat adeo tardus aut fugiens laboris , quin statim castris exeundum atque occurrendum putaret . <end>$$<start> But when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right , and observed our van was already passing the line of their camp , there was nobody so stupid , or averse to fatigue , as not to think it necessary to march from the camp immediately , and oppose us . <end>
<start> Conclamatur ad arma , atque omnes copiae paucis praesidio relictis cohortibus exeunt rectoque ad Hiberum itinere contendunt . <end>$$<start> The cry to arms was raised , and all the army , except a few which were left to guard the camp , set out and marched the direct road to the Ebro . <end>
<start> Erat in celeritate omne positum certamen , utri prius angustias montesque occuparent ; sed exercitum Caesaris viarum difficultates tardabant , Afranii copias equitatus Caesaris insequens morabatur . <end>$$<start> The contest depended entirely on dispatch , which should first get possession of the defile and the mountains . <end>
<start> Afranius , cum ab equitatu novissimum agmen premeretur , ante se hostem videret , collem quendam nactus ibi constitit . <end>$$<start> Caesar first accomplished the march , and having found a plain behind large rocks , drew up his army there in order of battle and facing the enemy . <end>
<start> Ex eo loco IIII cetratorum cohortes in montem , qui erat in conspectu omnium excelsissimus , mittit . <end>$$<start> Afranius , perceiving that his rear was galled by our cavalry , and seeing the enemy before him , having come to a hill , made a halt on it . <end>
<start> Hunc cum obliquo itinere cetrati peterent , conspicatus equitatus Caesaris in cohortes impetum fecit ; nec minimam partem temporis equitum vim cetrati sustinere potuerunt omnesque ab eis circumventi in conspectu utriusque exercitus interficiuntur . <end>$$<start> As the Spaniards were making toward it in an oblique direction , Caesar's horse espied them and attacked them , nor were they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment , but were all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the two armies . <end>
<start> Erat occasio bene gerendae rei Neque vero id Caesarem fugiebat , tanto sub oculis accepto detrimento perterritum exercitum sustinere non posse , praesertim circumdatum undique equitatu , cum in loco aequo atque aperto confligeretur ; idque ex omnibus partibus ab eo flagitabatur . <end>$$<start> There was now an opportunity for managing affairs successfully , nor did it escape Caesar , that an army daunted at suffering such a loss before their eyes , could not stand , especially as they were surrounded by our horse , and the engagement would take place on even and open ground . <end>
<start> Quod si iniquitatem loci timeret , datum iri tamen aliquo loco pugnandi facultatem , quod certe inde decedendum esset Afranio nec sine aqua permanere posset . <end>$$<start> But if he had any apprehensions from the disadvantage of the ground , that an opportunity would be given him of coming to battle in some other place : for that Afranius must certainly come down , and would not be able to remain there for want of water . <end>
<start> Caesar in eam spem venerat , se sine pugna et sine vulnere suorum rem conficere posse , quod re frumentaria adversarios interclusisset . <end>$$<start> Caesar had conceived hopes of ending the affair without an engagement , or without striking a blow , because he had cut off the enemy's supplies . <end>
<start> Cur etiam secundo proelio aliquos ex suis amitteret ? cur vulnerari pateretur optime de se meritos milites ? cur denique fortunam periclitaretur ? praesertim cum non minus esset imperatoris consilio superare quam gladio . <end>$$<start> Why should he hazard the loss of any of his men , even in a successful battle ? Why should he expose soldiers to be wounded , who had deserved so well of him ? Why , in short , should he tempt fortune ? especially when it was as much a general's duty to conquer by tactics as by the sword . <end>
<start> Movebatur etiam misericordia civium , quos interficiendos videbat ; quibus salvis atque incolumibus rem obtinere malebat . <end>$$<start> Besides , he was moved with compassion for those citizens , who , he foresaw , must fall : and he had rather gain his object without any loss or injury to them . <end>
<start> Hoc consilium Caesaris plerisque non probabatur : milites vero palam inter se loquebantur , quoniam talis occasio victoriae dimitteretur , etiam cum vellet Caesar , sese non esse pugnaturos . <end>$$<start> This resolution of Caesar was not generally approved of ; but the soldiers openly declared to each other that since such an opportunity of victory was let pass , they would not come to an engagement , even when Caesar should wish it . <end>
<start> Ille in sua sententia perseverat et paulum ex eo loco digreditur , ut timorem adversariis minuat . <end>$$<start> He persevered however in his resolution , and retired a little from that place to abate the enemy's fears . <end>
<start> Petreius atque Afranius oblata facultate in castra sese referunt . <end>$$<start> Petreius and Afranius , having got this opportunity , retired to their camp . <end>
<start> Caesar praesidiis montibus dispositis omni ad Hiberum intercluso itinere quam proxime potest hostium castris castra communit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having disposed parties on the mountains , and cut off all access to the Ebro , fortified his camp as close to the enemy as he could . <end>
<start> Postero die duces adversariorum perturbati , quod omnem rei frumentariae fluminisque Hiberi spem dimiserant , de reliquis rebus consultabant . <end>$$<start> The day following , the generals of his opponents , being alarmed that they had lost all prospect of supplies , and of access to the Ebro , consulted as to what other course they should take . <end>
<start> Erat unum iter , Ilerdam si reverti vellent ; alterum , si Tarraconem peterent . <end>$$<start> There were two roads , one to Ilerda , if they chose to return , the other to Tarraco , if they should march to it . <end>
<start> Haec consiliantibus eis nuntiantur aquatores ab equitatu premi nostro Qua re cognita crebras stationes disponunt equitum et cohortium alariarum legionariasque intericiunt cohortes vallumque ex castris ad aquam ducere incipiunt , ut intra munitionem et sine timore et sine stationibus aquari possent . <end>$$<start> While they were deliberating on these matters , intelligence was brought them that their watering parties were attacked by our horse : upon which information , they dispose several parties of horse and auxiliary foot along the road , and intermix some legionary cohorts , and begin to throw up a rampart from the camp to the water , that they might be able to procure water within their lines , both without fear , and without a guard . <end>
<start> Id opus inter se Petreius atque Afranius partiuntur ipsique perficiundi operis causa longius progrediuntur . <end>$$<start> Petreius and Afranius divided this task between themselves , and went in person to some distance from their camp for the purpose of seeing it accomplished . <end>
<start> Quorum discessu liberam nacti milites colloquiorum facultatem vulgo procedunt , et quem quisque in castris notum aut municipem habebat conquirit atque evocat . <end>$$<start> The soldiers having obtained by their absence a free opportunity of conversing with each other , came out in great numbers , and inquired each for whatever acquaintance or fellow-citizen he had in our camp , and invited him to him . <end>
<start> Primum agunt gratias omnibus , quod sibi perterritis pridie pepercissent : eorum se beneficio vivere Deinde de imperatoris fide quaerunt , rectene se illi sint commissuri , et quod non ab initio fecerint armaque cum hominibus necessariis et consanguineis contulerint , queruntur . <end>$$<start> First they returned them general thanks for sparing them the day before , when they were greatly terrified , and acknowledged that they were alive through their kindness ; then they inquired about the honor of our general , and whether they could with safety intrust themselves to him ; and declared their sorrow that they had not done so in the beginning , and that they had taken up arms against their relations and kinsmen . <end>
<start> His provocati sermonibus fidem ab imperatore de Petreii atque Afranii vita petunt , ne quod in se scelus concepisse neu suos prodidisse videantur . <end>$$<start> Encouraged by these conferences , they desired the general's parole for the lives of Petreius and Afranius , that they might not appear guilty of a crime , in having betrayed their generals . <end>
<start> Quibus confirmatis rebus se statim signa translaturos confirmant legatosque de pace primorum ordinum centuriones ad Caesarem mittunt . <end>$$<start> When they were assured of obtaining their demands , they promised that they would immediately remove their standards , and sent centurions of the first rank as deputies to treat with Caesar about a peace . <end>
<start> Interim alii suos in castra invitandi causa adducunt , alii ab suis abducuntur , adeo ut una castra iam facta ex binis viderentur ; compluresque tribuni militum et centuriones ad Caesarem veniunt seque ei commendant . <end>$$<start> In the mean time some of them invite their acquaintances , and bring them to their camp , others are brought away by their friends , so that the two camps seemed to be united into one , and several of the tribunes and centurions came to Caesar , and paid their respects to him . <end>
<start> Idem hoc fit a principibus Hispaniae , quos evocaverant et secum in castris habebant obsidum loco . <end>$$<start> The same was done by some of the nobility of Spain , whom they summoned to their assistance , and kept in their camp as hostages . <end>
<start> Hi suos notos hospitesque quaerebant , per quem quisque eorum aditum commendationis haberet ad Caesarem . <end>$$<start> They inquired after their acquaintance and friends , by whom each might have the means of being recommended to Caesar . <end>
<start> Afranii etiam filius adulescens de sua ac parentis sui salute cum Caesare per Sulpicium legatum agebat . <end>$$<start> Even Afranius's son , a young man , endeavored , by means of Sulpitius the lieutenant , to make terms for his own and his father's life . <end>
<start> Erant plena laetitia et gratulatione omnia , eorum , qui tanta pericula vitasse , et eorum , qui sine vulnere tantas res confecisse videbantur , magnumque fructum suae pristinae lenitatis omnium iudicio Caesar ferebat , consiliumque eius a cunctis probabatur . <end>$$<start> Every place was filled with mirth and congratulations ; in the one army , because they thought they had escaped so impending danger ; in the other , because they thought they had completed so important a matter without blows ; and Caesar , in every man's judgment , reaped the advantage of his former lenity , and his conduct was applauded by all . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus nuntiatis Afranius ab instituto opere discedit seque in castra recipit , sic paratus , ut videbatur , ut , quicumque accidisset casus , hunc quieto et aequo animo ferret . <end>$$<start> When these circumstances were announced to Afranius , he left the work which he had begun , and returned to his camp , determined as it appeared , whatever should be the event , to bear it with an even and steady mind . <end>
<start> Petreius vero non deserit sese Armat familiam ; cum hac et praetoria cohorte cetratorum barbarisque equitibus paucis , beneficiariis suis , quos suae custodiae causa habere consuerat , improviso ad vallum advolat , colloquia militum interrumpit , nostros repellit a castris , quos deprendit interficit . <end>$$<start> Petreius did not neglect himself ; he armed his domestics ; with them and the praetorian cohort of Spaniards , and a few foreign horse , his dependents , whom he commonly kept near him to guard his person , he suddenly flew to the rampart , interrupted the conferences of the soldiers , drove our men from the camp , and put to death as many as he caught . <end>
<start> Reliqui coeunt inter se et repentino periculo exterriti sinistras sagis involvunt gladiosque destringunt atque ita se a cetratis equitibusque defendunt castrorum propinquitate confisi seque in castra recipiunt et ab eis cohortibus , quae erant in statione ad portas , defenduntur . <end>$$<start> The rest formed into a body , and being alarmed by the unexpected danger , wrapped their left arms in their cloaks , and drew their swords , and in this manner , depending on the nearness of their camp , defended themselves against the Spaniards , and the horse , and made good their retreat to the camp , where they were protected by the cohorts which were on guard . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus confectis flens Petreius manipulos circumit militesque appellat , neu se neu Pompeium , imperatorem suum , adversariis ad supplicium tradant , obsecrat . <end>$$<start> Petreius , after accomplishing this , went round every maniple , calling the soldiers by their names , and entreating with tears that they would not give up him and their absent general Pompey , as a sacrifice to the vengeance of their enemies . <end>
<start> Fit celeriter concursus in praetorium Postulat , ut iurent omnes se exercitum ducesque non deserturos neque prodituros neque sibi separatim a reliquis consilium capturos . <end>$$<start> Immediately they ran in crowds to the general's pavilion , when he required them all to take an oath that they would not desert nor betray the army nor the generals , nor form any design distinct from the general interest . <end>
<start> Princeps in haec verba iurat ipse ; idem iusiurandum adigit Afranium ; subsequuntur tribuni militum centurionesque ; centuriatim producti milites idem iurant . <end>$$<start> He himself swore first to the tenor of those words , and obliged Afranius to take the same oath . <end>
<start> Edicunt , penes quem quisque sit Caesaris miles , ut producatur : productos palam in praetorio interficiunt . <end>$$<start> The tribunes and centurions followed their example ; the soldiers were brought out by centuries , and took the same oath . <end>
<start> Sic terror oblatus a ducibus , crudelitas in supplicio , nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit . <end>$$<start> Thus the terror raised by the generals , the cruelty of the punishments , the new obligation of an oath , removed all hopes of surrender for the present , changed the soldiers' minds , and reduced matters to the former state of war . <end>
<start> Caesar , qui milites adversariorum in castra per tempus colloquii venerant , summa diligentia conquiri et remitti iubet . <end>$$<start> Caesar ordered the enemy's soldiers , who had come into his camp to hold a conference , to be searched for with the strictest diligence , and sent back . <end>
<start> Sed ex numero tribunorum militum centurionumque nonnulli sua voluntate apud eum remanserunt . <end>$$<start> But of the tribunes and centurions , several voluntarily remained with him , and he afterward treated them with great respect . <end>
<start> Quos ille postea magno in honore habuit ; centuriones in priores ordines , equites Romanos in tribunicium restituit honorem . <end>$$<start> The centurions he promoted to higher ranks , and conferred on the Roman knights the honor of tribunes . <end>
<start> Premebantur Afraniani pabulatione , aquabantur aegre . <end>$$<start> Afranius's men were distressed in foraging , and procured water with difficulty . <end>
<start> Frumenti copiam legionarii nonnullam habebant , quod dierum XXII ab Ilerda frumentum iussi erant efferre , cetrati auxiliaresque nullam , quorum erant et facultates ad parandum exiguae et corpora insueta ad onera portanda . <end>$$<start> The legionary soldiers had a tolerable supply of corn , because they had beef ordered to bring from Ilerda sufficient to last twenty-two days ; the Spanish and auxiliary forces had none , for they had but few opportunities of procuring any , and their bodies were not accustomed to bear burdens ; and therefore a great number of them came over to Caesar every day . <end>
<start> Itaque magnus eorum cotidie numerus ad Caesarem perfugiebat In his erat angustiis res Sed ex propositis consiliis duobus explicitius videbatur Ilerdam reverti , quod ibi paulum frumenti reliquerant . <end>$$<start> Their affairs were under these difficulties ; but of the two schemes proposed , the most expedient seemed to be to return to Ilerda , because they had left some corn there ; and there they hoped to decide on a plan for their future conduct . <end>
<start> Ibi se reliquum consilium explicaturos confidebant Tarraco aberat longius ; quo spatio plures rem posse casus recipere intellegebant . <end>$$<start> Tarraco lay at a greater distance ; and in such a space they knew affairs might admit of many changes . <end>
<start> Hoc probato consilio ex castris proficiscuntur . <end>$$<start> Their design having met with approbation , they set out from their camp . <end>
<start> Caesar equitatu praemisso , qui novissimum agmen carperet atque impediret , ipse cum legionibus subsequitur . <end>$$<start> Caesar having sent forward his cavalry , to annoy and retard their rear , followed close after with his legions . <end>
<start> Nullum intercedebat tempus , quin extremi cum equitibus proeliarentur . <end>$$<start> Not a moment passed in which their rear was not engaged with our horse . <end>
<start> Si mons erat ascendendus , facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat , quod ex locis superioribus , qui antecesserant , suos ascendentes protegebant ; cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat , neque ei , qui antecesserant , morantibus opem ferre poterant , equites vero ex loco superiore in aversos tela coniciebant , tum magno erat in periculo res . <end>$$<start> When they approached a valley or declivity , and the advanced men could not impart assistance to the tardy , our horse threw their darts at them from the rising grounds with advantage ; then their affairs were in a perilous situation ; the only plan left was , that whenever they came near such places , they should give orders to the legions to halt , and by a violent effort repulse our horse ; and these being forced to give way , they should suddenly , with the utmost speed , run all together down to the valley , and having passed it , should face about again on the next hill . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur , ut , cum eiusmodi locis esset appropinquatum , legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum repellerent , eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in valles universi demitterent atque ita transgressi rursus in locis superioribus consisterent . <end>$$<start> For so far were they from deriving any assistance from their horse (of which they had a large number) , that they were obliged to receive them into the center of their army , and themselves protect them , as they were daunted by former battles . <end>
<start> Tali dum pugnatur modo , lente atque paulatim proceditur , crebroque , ut sint auxilio suis , subsistunt ; ut tum accidit . <end>$$<start> While skirmishes were fought in this manner , they advanced but slowly and gradually , and frequently halted to help their rear , as then happened . <end>
<start> Milia enim progressi IIII vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu montem excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra muniunt neque iumentis onera deponunt . <end>$$<start> For having advanced four miles , and being very much harassed by our horse , they took post on a high mountain , and there in trenched themselves on the front only , facing the enemy ; and did not take their baggage off their cattle . <end>
<start> Ubi Caesaris castra posita tabernaculaque constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa animum adverterunt , sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta eiusdem diei et spem nacti morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter facere incipiunt . <end>$$<start> When they perceived that Caesar's camp was pitched , and the tents fixed up , and his horse sent out to forage , they suddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day , and , having hopes that we should be delayed by the absence of our horse , they began to march , which Caesar perceiving , followed them with the legions that remained . <end>
<start> Qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis legionibus subsequitur , praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortes relinquit ; hora x subsequi pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet . <end>$$<start> He left a few cohorts to guard his baggage , and ordered the foragers to be called home at the tenth hour , and the horse to follow him . <end>
<start> Celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur Pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen , adeo ut paene terga convertant , compluresque milites , etiam nonnulli centuriones , interficiuntur . <end>$$<start> The horse shortly returned to their daily duty on march , and charged the rear so vigorously , that they almost forced them to fly ; and several privates and some centurions were killed . <end>
<start> Instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum imminebat . <end>$$<start> The main body of Caesar's army was at hand , and universal ruin threatened them . <end>
<start> Tum vero neque ad explorandum idoneum locum castris neque ad progrediendum data facultate consistunt necessario et procul ab aqua et natura iniquo loco castra ponunt . <end>$$<start> Then indeed , not having opportunity either to choose a convenient position for their camp , or to march forward , they were obliged to halt , and to encamp at a distance from water , and on ground naturally unfavorable . <end>
<start> Sed isdem de causis Caesar , quae supra sunt demonstratae , proelio non lacessit et eo die tabernacula statui passus non est , quo paratiores essent ad insequendum omnes , sive noctu sive interdiu erumperent . <end>$$<start> But for the reasons already given , Caesar did not attack them , nor suffer a tent to be pitched that day , that his men might be the readier to pursue them whether they attempted to run off by night or by day . <end>
<start> Illi animadverso vitio castrorum tota nocte munitiones proferunt castraque castris convertunt . <end>$$<start> Observing the defect in their position , they spent the whole night in extending their work , and turning their camp to ours . <end>
<start> Prima nocte aquandi causa nemo egreditur ex castris ; proximo die praesidio in castris relicto universas ad aquam copias educunt , pabulatum emittitur nemo . <end>$$<start> The next day , they left a guard in the camp , and led out all their forces to water : but not a person was sent to look for forage . <end>
<start> His eos suppliciis male haberi Caesar et necessariam subire deditionem quam proelio decertare malebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar was more desirous that they should be humbled by these means , and forced to come to terms , than decide the contest by battle . <end>
<start> Conatur tamen eos vallo fossaque circummunire , ut quam maxime repentinas eorum eruptiones demoretur ; quo necessario descensuros existimabat . <end>$$<start> Yet he endeavored to surround them with a wall and trench , that he might be able to check their most sudden sally , to which he imagined that they must have recourse . <end>
<start> Illi et inopia pabuli adducti et , quo essent expeditiores , omnia sarcinaria iumenta interfici iubent . <end>$$<start> Hereupon , urged by want of fodder , that they might be the readier for a march , they killed all their baggage cattle . <end>
<start> In his operibus consiliisque biduum consumitur ; tertio die magna iam pars operis Caesaris processerat . <end>$$<start> In this work , and the deliberations on it , two days were spent . <end>
<start> Illi impediendae reliquae munitionis causa hora circiter VIIII signo dato legiones educunt aciemque sub castris instruunt . <end>$$<start> To interrupt his progress , they drew out their legions about the eighth hour , by a certain signal , and placed them in order of battle before their camp . <end>
<start> Caesar ab opere legiones revocat , equitatum omnem convenire iubet , aciem instruit ; contra opinionen enim militum famamque omnium videri proelium defugisse magnum detrimentum afferebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar calling his legions off from their work , and ordering the horse to hold themselves in readiness , marshaled his army : for to appear to decline an engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldiers and the general voice , would have been attended with great disadvantage . <end>
<start> Sed eisdem de causis , quae sunt cognitae , quo minus dimicare vellet , movebatur , atque hoc etiam magis , quod spatii brevitate etiam in fugam coniectis adversariis non multum ad summam victoria iuvare poterat . <end>$$<start> But for the reasons already known , he was dissuaded from wishing to engage , and the more especially , because the short space between the camps , even if the enemy were put to flight , would not contribute much to a decisive victory ; for the two camps were not distant from each other above two thousand feet . <end>
<start> Non enim amplius pedum milibus duobus ab castris castra distabant ; hinc duas partes acies occupabant duae ; tertia vacabat ad incursum atque impetum militum relicta . <end>$$<start> Two parts of this were occupied by the armies , and one third left for the soldiers to charge and make their attack . <end>
<start> Si proelium committeretur , propinquitas castrorum celerem superatis ex fuga receptum dabat . <end>$$<start> If a battle should be begun , the nearness of the camps would afford a ready retreat to the conquered party in the flight . <end>
<start> Acies erat Afraniana duplex legionum V ; tertium in subsidiis locum alariae cohortes obtinebant ; Caesaris triplex ; sed primam aciem quaternae cohortes ex V legionibus tenebant , has subsidiariae ternae et rursus aliae totidem suae cuiusque legionis subsequebantur ; sagittarii funditoresque media continebantur acie , equitatus latera cingebat . <end>$$<start> Afranius's five legions were drawn up in two lines , the auxiliary cohorts formed the third line , and acted as reserves Caesar had three lines , four cohorts out of each of the five legions formed the first line . <end>
<start> Tali instructa acie tenere uterque propositum videbatur : Caesar , ne nisi coactus proelium committeret ; ille , ut opera Caesaris impediret . <end>$$<start> The slingers and archers were stationed in the center of the line ; the cavalry closed the flanks . <end>
<start> Qua re animadversa Caesar Germanos levis armaturae equitumque partem flumen traicit crebrasque in ripis custodias disponit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having perceived this , sent some light armed Germans and a party of horse across the river , and disposed several parties along the banks to guard them . <end>
<start> Tandem omnibus rebus obsessi , quartum iam diem sine pabulo retentis iumentis , aquae , lignorum , frumenti inopia colloquium petunt et id , si fieri possit , semoto a militibus loco . <end>$$<start> At length , beset on all sides , their cattle having been four days without fodder , and having no water , wood , or corn , they beg a conference ; and that , if possible , in a place remote from the soldiers . <end>
<start> Ubi id a Caesare negatum et , palam si colloqui vellent , concessum est , datur obsidis loco Caesari filius Afranii . <end>$$<start> When this was refused by Caesar , but a public interview offered if they chose it , Afranius's son was given as a hostage to Caesar . <end>
<start> Venitur in eum locum , quem Caesar delegit . <end>$$<start> They met in the place appointed by Caesar . <end>
<start> Audiente utroque exercitu loquitur Afranius : non esse aut ipsis aut militibus succensendum , quod fidem erga imperatorem suum Gnaeus Pompeium conservare voluerint . <end>$$<start> In the hearing of both armies Afranius spoke thus : That Caesar ought not to be displeased either with him or his soldiers , for wishing to preserve their attachment to their general , Cneius Pompey . <end>
<start> Sed satis iam fecisse officio satisque supplicii tulisse perpessos omnium rerum inopiam ; nunc vero paene ut feras circummunitos prohiberi aqua , prohiberi ingressu , neque corpore dolorem neque animo ignominiam ferre posse Itaque se victos confiteri ; orare atque obsecrare , si qui locus misericordiae relinquatur , ne ad ultimum supplicium progredi necesse habeat . <end>$$<start> That they had now sufficiently discharged their duty to him , and had suffered punishment enough , in having endured the want of every necessary : but now , pent up almost like wild beasts , they were prevented from procuring water , and prevented from walking abroad ; and were not able to bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace : but confessed themselves vanquished : and begged and entreated , if there was any room left for mercy , that they should not be necessitated to suffer the most severe penalties . <end>
<start> Haec quam potest demississime et subiectissime exponit . <end>$$<start> These sentiments were delivered in the most submissive and humble language . <end>
<start> Ad ea Caesar respondit : nulli omnium has partes vel querimoniae vel miserationis minus convenisse Reliquos enim omnes officium suum praestitisse : se , qui etiam bona condicione , et loco et tempore aequo , confligere noluerit , ut quam integerrima essent ad pacem omnia ; exercitum suum , qui iniuria etiam accepta suisque interfectis , quos in sua potestate habuerit , conservarit et texerit ; illius denique exercitus milites , qui per se de concilianda pace egerint ; qua in re omnium suorum vitae consulendum putarint . <end>$$<start> Caesar replied , That either to complain or sue for mercy became no man less than him : for that every other person had done their duty : himself , in having declined to engage on favorable terms , in an advantageous situation and time , that all things tending to a peace might be totally unembarrassed : his army , in having preserved and protected the men whom they had in their power , notwithstanding the injuries which they had received , and the murder of their comrades ; and even Afranius's soldiers , who of themselves treated about concluding a peace , by which they thought that they would secure the lives of all . <end>
<start> Sic omnium ordinum partes in misericordia constitisse : ipsos duces a pace abhorruisse ; eos neque colloquii neque indutiarum iura servasse et homines imperitos et per colloquium deceptos crudelissime interfecisse Accidisse igitur his , quod plerumque hominum nimia pertinacia atque arrogantia accidere soleat , uti eo recurrant et id cupidissime petant , quod paulo ante contempserint . <end>$$<start> Thus , that the parties on both sides inclined to mercy : that the generals only were averse to peace : that they paid no regard to the laws either of conference or truce ; and had most inhumanly put to death ignorant persons , who were deceived by a conference : that therefore , they had met that fate which usually befalls men from excessive obstinacy and arrogance ; and were obliged to have recourse , and most earnestly desire that which they had shortly before disdained . <end>
<start> Neque nunc se illorum humilitate neque aliqua temporis opportunitate postulare , quibus rebus opes augeantur suae ; sed eos exercitus , quos contra se multos iam annos aluerint , velle dimitti Neque enim sex legiones alia de causa missas in Hispaniam septimamque ibi conscriptam neque tot tantasque classes paratas neque submissos duces rei militaris peritos Nihil horum ad pacandas Hispanias , nihil ad usum provinciae provisum , quae propter diuturnitatem pacis nullum auxilium desiderarit Omnia haec iam pridem contra se parari ; in se novi generis imperia constitui , ut idem ad portas urbanis praesideat rebus et duas bellicosissimas provincias absens tot annis obtineat ; in se iura magistratuum commutari , ne ex praetura et consulatu , ut semper , sed per paucos probati et electi in provincias mittantur ; in se etiam aetatis excusationem nihil valere , cum superioribus bellis probati ad obtinendos exercitus evocentur ; in se uno non servari , quod sit omnibus datum semper imperatoribus , ut rebus feliciter gestis aut cum honore aliquo aut certe sine ignominia domum revertantur exercitumque dimittant . <end>$$<start> That for his part , he would not avail himself of their present humiliation , or his present advantage , to require terms by which his power might be increased , but only that those armies , which they had maintained for so many years to oppose him , should be disbanded : for six legions had been sent into Spain , and a seventh raised there , and many and powerful fleets provided , and generals of great military experience sent to command them , for no other purpose than to oppose him : that none of these measures were adopted to keep the Spains in peace , or for the use of the province , which , from the length of the peace , stood in need of no such aid ; that all these things were long since designed against him ; that against him a new sort of government was established , that the same person should be at the gates of Rome , to direct the affairs of the city ; and though absent , have the government of two most warlike provinces for so many years : that against him the laws of the magistrates had been altered ; that the late praetors and consuls should not be sent to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom , but persons approved of and chosen by a faction . <end>
<start> Id vero militibus fuit pergratum et iucundum , ut ex ipsa significatione cognosci potuit , ut , qui aliquid iusti incommodi exspectavissent , ultro praemium missionis ferrent . <end>$$<start> It was very acceptable and agreeable to Afranius's soldiers , as might be easily known from their signs of joy , that they who expected some injury after this defeat , should obtain without solicitation the reward of a dismissal . <end>
<start> Nam cum de loco et tempore eius rei controversia inferretur , et voce et manibus universi ex vallo , ubi constiterant , significare coeperunt , ut statim dimitterentur , neque omni interposita fide firmum esse posse , si in aliud tempus differretur . <end>$$<start> After a short debate on either side , it was brought to this issue : that those who had any settlement or possession in Spain , should be immediately discharged : the rest at the river Var . <end>
<start> Caesar ex eo tempore , dum ad flumen Varum veniatur , se frumentum daturum pollicetur . <end>$$<start> Caesar promised to supply them with corn from the present time till they arrived at the river Var . <end>
<start> Addit etiam , ut , quod quisque eorum in bello amiserit , quae sint penes milites suos , eis , qui amiserint , restituatur ; militibus aequa facta aestimatione pecuniam pro his rebus dissolvit . <end>$$<start> He further adds , that whatever any of them lost in the war , which was in the possession of his soldiers , should be restored to those that lost them . <end>
<start> Quascumque postea controversias inter se milites habuerunt , sua sponte ad Caesarem in ius adierunt . <end>$$<start> To his soldiers he made a recompense in money for those things , a just valuation being made . <end>
<start> Petreius atque Afranius cum stipendium ab legionibus paene seditione facta flagitarentur , cuius illi diem nondum venisse dicerent , Caesar ut cognosceret , postulatum est , eoque utrique , quod statuit , contenti fuerunt . <end>$$<start> Whatever disputes Afranius's soldiers had afterward among themselves , they voluntarily submitted to Caesar's decision . <end>
<start> Parte circiter tertia exercitus eo biduo dimissa duas legiones suas antecedere , reliquas subsequi iussit , ut non longo inter se spatio castra facerent , eique negotio Quintus Fufium Calenum legatum praeficit . <end>$$<start> Afranius and Petreius , when pay was demanded by the legions , a sedition almost breaking out , asserted that the time had not yet come , and required that Caesar should take cognizance of it ; and both parties were content with his decision . <end>
<start> Hoc eius praescripto ex Hispania ad Varum flumen est iter factum , atque ibi reliqua pars exercitus dimissa est . <end>$$<start> About a third part of their army being dismissed in two days , Caesar ordered two of his legions , to go before , the rest to follow the vanquished enemy ; that they should encamp at a small distance from each other . <end>&&&&
