<start> Dum haec in Hispania geruntur , Gaius Trebonius legatus , qui ad oppugnationem Massiliae relictus erat , duabus ex partibus aggerrem , vineas turresque ad oppidum agere instituit Una erat proxima portui navalibusque , altera ad portam , qua est aditus ex Gallia atque Hispania , ad id mare , quod adiacet ad ostium Rhodani . <end>$$<start> While these things were going forward in Spain , Caius Trebonius , Caesar's lieutenant , who had been left to conduct the assault of Massilia , began to raise a mound , vineae , and turrets against the town , on two sides ; one of which was next the harbor and docks , the other on that part where there is a passage from Gaul and Spain to that sea which forces itself up the mouth of the Rhone . <end>
<start> Massilia enim fere tribus ex oppidi partibus mari alluitur ; reliqua quarta est , quae aditum habeat ab terra . <end>$$<start> For Massilia is washed almost on three sides by the sea , the remaining fourth part is the only side which has access by land . <end>
<start> Huius quoque spatii pars ea , quae ad arcem pertinet , loci natura et valle altissima munita longam et difficilem habet oppugnationem . <end>$$<start> A part even of this space , which reaches to the fortress , being fortified by the nature of the country , and a very deep valley , required a long and difficult siege . <end>
<start> Ad ea perficienda opera Gaius Trebonius magnam iumentorum atque hominum multitudinem ex omni provincia vocat ; vimina materiamque comportari iubet . <end>$$<start> To accomplish these works , Caius Trebonius sends for a great quantity of carriages and men from the whole Province , and orders hurdles and materials to be furnished . <end>
<start> Quibus comparatis rebus aggerem in altitudinem pedum LXXX exstruit . <end>$$<start> These things being provided , he raised a mound eighty feet in height . <end>
<start> Sed tanti erant antiquitus in oppido omnium rerum ad bellum apparatus tantaque multitudo tormentorum , ut eorum vim nullae contextae viminibus vineae sustinere possent . <end>$$<start> But so great a store of every thing necessary for a war had been a long time before laid up in the town , and so great a number of engines , that no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force . <end>
<start> Asseres enim pedum XII cuspidibus praefixi atque hi maximis bllistis missi per IIII ordines cratium in terra defigebantur . <end>$$<start> Therefore the arches of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot thick , fastened together , and under this the materials of the agger were handed from one to another . <end>
<start> Antecedebat testudo pedum LX aequandi loci causa facta item ex fortissimis lignis , convoluta omnibus rebus , quibus ignis iactus et lapides defendi possent . <end>$$<start> But the greatness of the works , the height of the wall and towers , and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works . <end>
<start> Sed magnitudo operum , altitudo muri atque turrium , multitudo tormentorum omnem administrationem tardabat . <end>$$<start> Besides , frequent sallies were made from the town by the Albici , and fire was thrown on our mound and turrets . <end>
<start> Interim L Nasidius , a Gnaeus Pompeio cum classe navium XVI , in quibus paucae erant aeratae , Lucius Domitio Massiliensibusque subsidio missus , freto Siciliae imprudente atque inopinante Curione pervehitur appulsisque Messanam navibus atque inde propter repentinum terrorem principum ac senatus fuga facta navem ex navalibus eorum deducit . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , Lucius Nasidius , being sent by Cneius Pompey with a fleet of sixteen sail , a few of which had beaks of brass , to the assistance of Lucius Domitius and the Massilians , passed the straits of Sicily without the knowledge or expectation of Curio , and , putting with his fleet into Messana , and making the nobles and senate take flight with the sudden terror , carried off one of their ships out of dock . <end>
<start> Hac adiuncta ad reliquas naves cursum Massiliam versus perficit praemissaque clam navicula Domitium Massiliensesque de suo adventu certiores facit eosque magnopere hortatur , ut rursus cum Bruti classe additis suis auxiliis confligant . <end>$$<start> Having joined this to his other ships , he made good his voyage to Massilia , and having sent in a galley privately , acquaints Domitius and the Massilians of his arrival , and earnestly encourages them to hazard another battle with Brutus's fleet with the addition of his aid . <end>
<start> Massilienses post superius incommodum veteres ad eundem numerum ex navalibus productas naves refecerant summaque industria armaverant (remigum , gubernatorum magna copia suppetebat) piscatoriasque adiecerant atque contexerant , ut essent ab ictu telorum remiges tuti ; has sagittariis tormentisque compleverunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians , since their former loss , had brought the same number of old ships from the docks , and had repaired and fitted them out with great industry : they had a large supply of seamen and pilots . <end>
<start> Tali modo instructa classe omnium seniorum , matrum familiae , virginum precibus et fletu excitati , extremo tempore civitati subvenirent , non minore animo ac fiducia , quam ante dimicaverant , naves conscendunt . <end>$$<start> They had got several fishing-smacks , and covered them over , that the seamen might be secure against darts : these they filled with archers and engines . <end>
<start> Communi enim fit vitio naturae , ut inusitatis atque incognitis rebus magis confidamus vehementiusque exterreamur ; ut tum accidit . <end>$$<start> With a fleet thus appointed , encouraged by the entreaties and tears of all the old men , matrons , and virgins to succor the state in this hour of distress , they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had fought before . <end>
<start> Nacti idoneum ventum ex portu exeunt et Tauroenta , quod est castellum Massilensium , ad Nasidium perveniunt ibique naves expediunt rursusque se ad confligendum animo confirmant et consilia communicant . <end>$$<start> Having got a fair wind , they sailed out of port and went to Nasidius to Taurois , which is a fort belonging to the Massilians , and there ranged their fleet and again encouraged each other to engage and communicated their plan of operation . <end>
<start> Dextra pars attribuitur Massiliensibus , sinistra Nasidio . <end>$$<start> The command of the right division was given to the Massilians , that of the left to Nasidius . <end>
<start> Eodem Brutus contendit aucto navium numero Nam ad eas , quae factae erant Arelate per Caesarem , captivae Massiliensium accesserant sex . <end>$$<start> Brutus sailed to the same place with an augmented fleet ; for to those made by Caesar at Arelas were added six ships taken from the Massilians , which he had refitted since the last battle and had furnished with every necessary . <end>
<start> Has superioribus diebus refecerat atque omnibus rebus instruxerat Itaque suos cohortatus , quos integros superarissent ut victos contemnerent , plenus spei bonae atque animi adversus eos proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , having encouraged his men to despise a vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken , he advanced against them full of confidence and spirit . <end>
<start> Facile erat ex castris Gaius Trebonii atque omnibus superioribus locis prospicere in urbem , ut omnis iuventus , quae in oppido remanserat , omnesque superioris aetatis cum liberis atque uxoribus ex publicis locis custodiisque aut e muro ad caelum manus tenderent , aut templa deorum immortalium adirent et ante simulacra proiecti victoriam ab diis ecerent . <end>$$<start> From Trebonius's camp and all the higher grounds it was easy to see into the town-how all the youth which remained in it , and all persons of more advanced years , with their wives and children , and the public guards , were either extending their hands from the wall to the heavens , or were repairing to the temples of the immortal gods , and prostrating themselves before their images , were entreating them to grant them victory . <end>
<start> Neque erat quisquam omnium , quin in eius diei casu suarum omnium fortunarum eventum consistere existimaret Nam et honesti ex iuventute et cuiusque aetatis amplissimi nominatim evocati atque obsecrati naves conscenderant ut , si quid adversi accidisset , ne ad conandum quidem sibi quicquam reliqui fore viderent ; si superavissent , vel domesticis opibus vel externis auxiliis de salute urbis confiderent . <end>$$<start> Nor was there a single person who did not imagine that his future fortune depended on the issue of that day ; for the choice of their youth and the most respectable of every age , being expressly invited and solicited , had gone on board the fleet , that if any adverse fate should befall them they might see that nothing was left for them to attempt , and , if they proved victorious , they might have hopes of preserving the city , either by their internal resources or by foreign assistance . <end>
<start> Commisso proelio Massiliensibus res nulla ad virtutem defuit ; sed memores eorum praeceptorum , quae paulo ante ab suis aeceperant , hoc animo decertabant , ut nullum aliud tempus ad conandum habituri viderentur , et quibus in pugna vitae periculum accideret , non ita multo se reliquorum civium fatum antecedere existimareut , quibus urbe capta eadem esset belli fortuna patienda . <end>$$<start> When the battle was begun , no effort of valor was wanting to the Massilians , but , mindful of the instructions which they had a little before received from their friends , they fought with such spirit as if they supposed that they would never have another opportunity to attempt a defense , and as if they believed that those whose lives should be endangered in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the citizens , who , if the city was taken , must undergo the same fortune of war . <end>
<start> Diductisque nostris paulatim navibus et artificio gubernatorum et mobilitati navium locus dabatur , et si quando nostri facultatem nacti ferreis manibus iniectis navem religaverant , undique suis laborantibus succurrebant . <end>$$<start> Our ships being at some distance from each other , room was allowed both for the skill of their pilots and the maueuvering of their ships ; and if at any time ours , gaining an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their ships , grappled with them , from all parts they assisted those who were distressed . <end>
<start> Neque vero coniuncti Albici comminus pugnando deficiebant neque multum cedebant virtute nostris . <end>$$<start> Nor , after being joined by the Albici , did they decline coming to close engagement , nor were they much inferior to our men in valor . <end>
<start> Simul ex minoribus navibus magna vis eminus missa telorum multa nostris de improviso imprudentibus atque impeditis vulnera inferebant Conspicataeque naves triremes duae navem D Bruti , quae ex insigni facile agnosci poterat , duabus ex partibus sese in eam incitaverant Sed tantum re provisa Brutus celeritate navis enisus est , ut parvo momento antecederet . <end>$$<start> At the same time , showers of darts , thrown from a distance from the lesser ships , suddenly inflicted several wounds on our men when off their guard and otherwise engaged ; and two of their three-decked galleys ; having descried the ship of Decimus Brutus , which could be easily distinguished by its flag , rowed up against him with great violence from opposite sides : but Brutus , seeing into their designs , by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with such address as to get clear , though only by a moment . <end>
<start> Illae adeo graviter inter se incitatae conflixerunt , ut vehementissime utraque ex concursu laborarent , altera vero praefracto rostro tota collabefieret Qua re animadversa , quae proximae ei loco ex Bruti classe naves erant , in eas impeditas impetum faciunt celeriterque ambas deprimunt . <end>$$<start> From the velocity of their motion they struck against each other with such violence that they were both excessively injured by the shock ; the beak , indeed , of one of them being broken off , the whole ship was ready to founder , which circumstance being observed , the ships of Brutus's fleet , which were nearest that station , attack them when in this disorder and sink them both . <end>
<start> Sed Nasidianae naves nullo usui fuerunt celeriterque pugna excesserunt ; non enim has aut conspectus patriae aut propinquorum praecepta ad extremum vitae periculum adire cogebant . <end>$$<start> But Nasidius's ships were of no use , and soon left the fight ; for the sight of their country , or the entreaties of their relations , did not urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives . <end>
<start> Itaque ex eo numero navium nulla desiderata est : ex Massiliensium classe V sunt depressae , IV captae , una cum Nasidianis profugit ; quae omnes citeriorem Hispaniam petiverunt At ex reliquis una praemissa Massiliam huius nuntii perferendi gratia cum iam appropinquaret urbi , omnis sese multitudo ad cognoscendum effudit , et re cognita tantus luctus excepit , ut urbs ab hostibus capta eodem vestigio videretur . <end>$$<start> Therefore , of the number of the ships not one was lost : of the fleet of the Massilians five were sunk , four taken , and one ran off with Nasidius : all that escaped made the best of their way to Hither Spain , but one of the rest was sent forward to Massilia for the purpose of bearing this intelligence , and when it came near the city , the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings , and , on being informed of the event , were so oppressed with grief , that one would have imagined that the city had been taken by an enemy at the same moment . <end>
<start> Massilienses tamen nihilo secius ad defensionem urbis reliqua apparare coeperunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians , however , began to make the necessary preparations for the defense of their city with unwearied energy . <end>
<start> Est animadveraum ab legionibus , qui dextram partem operis administrabant , ex crebris hostium eruptionibus magno sibi ease praesidio posse , si ibi pro castello ac receptaculo turrim ex latere sub muro fecissent Quam primo ad repentinos incursus humilem parvamque fecerunt . <end>$$<start> The legionary soldiers who had the management of the works on the right side , observed , from the frequent sallies of the enemy , that it might prove a great protection to them to build a turret of brick under the wall for a fort and place of refuge , which they at first built low and small , to guard them against sudden attacks . <end>
<start> Huc se referebant ; hinc , si qua maior oppresserat vis , propugnabant ; hinc ad repellendum et prosequendum hostem procurrebant . <end>$$<start> To it they retreated , and from it they made defense if any superior force attacked them ; and from it they sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy . <end>
<start> Ubi turris altitudo perducta est ad contabulationem , eam in parietes instruxerunt , ita ut capita tignorum extrema parietum structura tegerentur , ne quid emineret , ubi ignis hostium adhaeresceret . <end>$$<start> When the turret was raised to the height for flooring , they laid it on the walls in such a manner that the ends of the joists were covered by the outer face of the wall , that nothing should project to which the enemy's fire might adhere . <end>
<start> Ita tuto ac sine ullo vulnere ac periculo sex tabulata exstruxerunt fenestrasque , quibus in locis visum est , ad tormenta mittenda in struendo reliquerunt . <end>$$<start> In this manner , securely and without a blow or danger , they raised it six stories high , and in laying the materials left loop-holes in such places as they thought proper for working their engines . <end>
<start> Ubi ex ea turri , quae circum essent opera , tueri se posse confisi sunt , musculum pedes LX longum ex materia bipedali , quem a turri latericia ad hostium turrim murumque perducerent , facere instituerunt ; cuius musculi haec erat forma . <end>$$<start> When they were confident that they could protect the works which lay around from this turret , they resolved to build a musculus , sixty feet long , of timber , two feet square , and to extend it from the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall . <end>
<start> Duae primum trabes in solo aeque longae distantes inter se pedes IIII collocantur , inque eis columellae pedum in altitudinem V defiguntur Has inter se capreolis molli fastigio coniungunt , ubi tigna , quae musculi tegendi causa ponant , collocentur . <end>$$<start> This was the form of it : first , two beams of equal length were laid on the ground , at the distance of four feet from each other ; and in them were fastened small pillars , five feet high , which were joined together by braces , with a gentle slope , on which the timber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be laid : upon this were laid beams , two feet square , bound with iron plates and nails . <end>
<start> Ad extremum musculi tectum trabesque extremas quadratas regulas IIII patentes digitos defigunt , quae lateres , qui super musculo struantur , contineant . <end>$$<start> The roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in the same manner as the joists were laid on the braces , the musculus was covered with tiles and mortar , to secure it against fire , which might be thrown from the wall . <end>
<start> Ita fastigato atque ordinatim structo , ut trabes erant in capreolis collocatae , lateribus lutoque musculus , ut ab igni , qui ex muro iaceretur , tutus esset , contegitur . <end>$$<start> Over the tiles hides are spread , to prevent the water let in on them by spouts from dissolving the cement of the bricks . <end>
<start> Super lateres coria inducuntur , ne canalibus aqua immissa lateres diluere posset Coria autem , ne rursus igni ac lapidibus corrumpantur , centonibus conteguntur . <end>$$<start> Again , the hides were covered over with mattresses , that they might not be destroyed by fire or stones . <end>
<start> Hoc opus omne tectum vineis ad ipsam turrim perficiunt subitoque inopinantibus hostibus machinatione navali , phalangis subiectis , ad turrim hostium admovent , ut aedificio iungatur . <end>$$<start> The soldiers under the protection of the vineae , finish this whole work to the very tower ; and suddenly , before the enemy were aware of it , moved it forward by naval machinery , by putting rollers under it , close up to the enemy's turret , so that it even touched the building . <end>
<start> Quo malo perterriti subito oppidani saxa quam maxima possunt vectibus promovent praecipitataque muro in musculum devolvunt . <end>$$<start> The townsmen , affrighted at this unexpected stroke , bring forward with levers the largest stones they can procure , and pitching them from the wall , roll them down on the musculus . <end>
<start> Ictum firmitas materiae sustinet , et quicquid incidit fastigio musculi elabitur . <end>$$<start> The strength of the timber withstood the shock ; and whatever fell on it slid off , on account of the sloping roof . <end>
<start> Id ubi vident , mutant consilium : cupas taeda ac pice refertas incendunt easque de muro in musculum devolvunt . <end>$$<start> When they perceived this , they altered their plan , and set fire to barrels , filled with resin and tar , and rolled them down from the wall on the musculus . <end>
<start> Involutae labuntur , delapsae ab lateribus longuriis furcisque ab opere removentur . <end>$$<start> As soon as they fell on it , they slid off again , and were removed from its side by long poles and forks . <end>
<start> Interim sub musculo milites vectibus infima saxa turris hostium , quibus fundamenta continebantur , convellunt . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , the soldiers , under cover of the musculus , were rooting out with crow-bars the lowest stones of the enemy's turret , with which the foundation was laid . <end>
<start> Musculus ex turri latericia a nostris telis tormentisque defenditur ; hostes ex muro ac turibus submoventur : non datur libera muri defendendi facultas . <end>$$<start> The musculus was defended by darts , thrown from engines by our men from the brick tower , and the enemy were beaten off from the wall and turrets ; nor was a fair opportunity of defending the walls given them . <end>
<start> Compluribus iam lapidibus ex ea , quae suberat , turri subductis repentina ruina pars eius turris concidit , pars reliqua consequens procumbebat : cum hostes urbis direptione perterriti inermes cum infulis se porta foras universi proripiunt ad legatos atque exercitum supplices manus tendunt . <end>$$<start> At length several stones being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the musculus , part of it fell down suddenly , and the rest , as if following it , leaned forward . <end>
<start> Ubi hostes ad legatos exercitumque pervenerunt , universi se ad pedes proiciunt ; orant , ut adventus Caesaris exspectetur : captam suam urbem videre : opera perfecta , turrim subrutam ; itaque ab defensione desistere . <end>$$<start> At this uncommon occurrence , the whole progress of the war was stopped , and the soldiers , turning away from the battle , ran eagerly to hear and listen to them . <end>
<start> Docent , si omnino turris concidisset , non posse milites contineri , quin spe praedae in urbem irrumperent urbemque delerent . <end>$$<start> They inform them that , if the turret had entirely fallen down , the soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it , in hopes of getting spoil . <end>
<start> Haec atque eiusdem generis complura ut ab hominibus doctis magna cum misericordia fletuque pronuntiantur . <end>$$<start> These and several other arguments to the same effect were delivered , as they were a people of great learning , with great pathos and lamentations . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus commoti legati milites ex opere deducunt , oppuguatione desistunt ; operibus custodias relinquunt . <end>$$<start> The lieutenants moved with compassion , draw off the soldiers from the work , desist from the assault , and leave sentinels on the works . <end>
<start> Caesar enim per litteras Trebonio magnopere mandaverat , ne per vim oppidum expugnari pateretur , ne gravius permoti milites et defectionis odio et contemptione sui et diutino labore omnes puberes interficerent ; quod se facturos minabantur , aegreque tunc sunt retenti , quin oppidum irrumperent , graviterque cam rem tulerunt , quod stetisse per Treboninm , quo minus oppido potirentur , videbatur . <end>$$<start> And it was with difficulty that they were then restrained from breaking into the town , and they were much displeased , because they imagined that they were prevented by Trebonius from taking possession of it . <end>
<start> Nostri repentina fortuna permoti arma , quae possunt , arripiunt ; alii ex castris sese incitant . <end>$$<start> Our men , alarmed at such an unexpected turn of fortune , lay hold on such arms as they could find . <end>
<start> Fit in hostes impetus ; sed de muro sagittis tormentisque fugientes persequi prohibentur . <end>$$<start> Some rush from the camp ; an attack is made on the enemy : but they were prevented , by arrows and engines from the walls ; from pursuing them when they fled . <end>
<start> Illi sub murum se recipiunt ibique musculum turrimque latericiam libere incendunt . <end>$$<start> They retired to their walls , and there , without fear , set the musculus and brick tower on fire . <end>
<start> Ita multorum mensium labor hostium perfidia et vi tempestatis puncto temporis interiit . <end>$$<start> Thus , by the perfidy of the enemy and the violence of the storm , the labor of many months was destroyed in a moment . <end>
<start> Temptaverunt hoc idem Massilienses postero die . <end>$$<start> The Massilians made the same attempt the next day , having got such another storm . <end>
<start> Eandem nacti tempestatem maiore cum fiducia ad alteram turrim aggeremque eruptione pugnaverunt multumque ignem intulerunt . <end>$$<start> They sallied out against the other tower and agger , and fought with more confidence . <end>
<start> Sed ut superioris temporis contentionem nostri omnem remiserant , ita proximi diei casu admoniti omnia ad defensionem paraverant . <end>$$<start> But as our men had on the former occasion given up all thoughts of a contest , so , warned by the event of the preceding day , they had made every preparation for a defense . <end>
<start> Itaque multis interfectis reliquos infecta re in oppidum reppulerunt . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , they slew several , and forced the rest to retreat into the town without effecting their design . <end>
<start> Trebonius ea , quae sunt amissa , multo majore militum studio administrare et reficere instituit Nam ubi tantos suos labores et apparatus male cecidisse viderunt indutiisque per scelus violatis suam virtutem irrisui fore perdoluerunt , quod , unde agger omnino comportari posset , nihil erat reliquum , omnibus arboribus longe lateque in finibus Massiliensium excisis et convectis , aggerem novi generis atque inauditum ex latericiis duobus muris senum pedum crassitudine atque eorum murorum contignatione facere instituerunt aequa fere altitudine , atque ille congesticius ex materia fuerat agger . <end>$$<start> Trebonius began to provide and repair what had been destroyed , with much greater zeal on the part of the soldiers ; for when they saw that their extraordinary pains and preparations had an unfortunate issue , they were fired with indignation that , in consequence of the impious violation of the truce , their valor should be held in derision . <end>
<start> Ubi aut spatium inter muros aut imbecillitas materiae postulare videretur , pilae interponuntur , traversaria tigna iniciuntur , quae firmamento esse possint , et quicquid est contignatum cratibus consternitur , crates luto integuntur . <end>$$<start> There was no place left them from which the materials for their mound could be fetched , in consequence of all the timber , far and wide , in the territories of the Massilians , having been cut down and carried away ; they began therefore to make an agger of a new construction , never heard of before , of two walls of brick , each six feet thick , and to lay floors over them of almost the same breadth with the agger , made of timber . <end>
<start> Portae , quibus locis videtur , eruptionis causa in muro relinquuntur . <end>$$<start> Gates for making sallies were left in the wall in such places as they thought proper . <end>
<start> Quod ubi hostes viderunt , ea , quae vix longinquo spatio refici non posse sperassent , paucorum dierum opera et labore ita refecta , ut nullus perfidiae neque eruptioni locus esset nec quicquam omnino relinqueretur , qua aut telis militibus aut igni operibus noceri posset , eodemque exemplo sentiunt totam urbem , qua sit aditus ab terra , muro turribusque circumiri posse , sic ut ipsis consistendi in suis munitionibus locus non esset , cum paene inaedificata muris ab exercitu nostro moenia viderentur ac telum manu coniceretur , suorumque tormentorum usum , quibus ipsi magna speravissent , spatio propinquitatis interire parique condicione ex muro ac turribus bellandi data se virtute nostris adaequare non posse intellegunt , ad easdem deditionis condiciones recurrunt . <end>$$<start> But when the enemy perceived that those works , which they had hoped could not be replaced without a great length of time , were put into so thorough repair by a few day's labor and diligence , that there was no room for perfidy or sallies , and that no means were left them by which they could either hurt the men by resistance or the works by fire , and when they found by former examples that their town could be surrounded with a wall and turrets on every part by which it was accessible by land , in such a manner that they could not have room to stand on their own fortifications , because our works were built almost on the top of their walls by our army , and darts could be thrown from our hands , and when they perceived that all advantage arising from their engines , on which they had built great hopes , was totally lost , and that though they had an opportunity of fighting with us on equal terms from walls and turrets , they could perceive that they were not equal to our men in bravery , they had recourse to the same proposals of surrender as before . <end>
<start> Varro in ulteriore Hispania initio cognitis eis rebus , quae sunt in Italia gestae , diffidens Pompeianis rebus amicissime de Caesare loquebatur : pracoccupatum sese legatione ab Gnaeus Pompeio teneri obstrictum fide ; necessitudinem quidem sibi nihilo minorem cum Caesare intercedere , neque se ignorare , quod esset officium legati , qui fiduciariam operam obtineret , quae vires suae , quae voluntas erga Caesarem totius provinciae . <end>$$<start> That though , being pre-engaged to Cneius Pompey in quality of lieutenant , he was bound in honor to him , that , nevertheless , there existed a very intimate tie between him and Caesar ; that he was not ignorant of what was the duty of a lieutenant , who bore an office of trust ; nor of his own strength , nor of the disposition of the whole province to Caesar . <end>
<start> Haec omnibus ferebat sermonibus neque se in ullam partem movebat . <end>$$<start> These sentiments he constantly expressed in his ordinary conversation , and did not attach himself to either party . <end>
<start> Postea vero , cum Caesarem ad Massiliam detineri cognovit , copias Petreii cum exercitu Afranii esse coniunctas , magna auxilia convenisse , magna esse in spe atque exspectari et consentire omnem citeriorem provinciam , quaeque postea acciderant , de angustiis ad Ilerdam rei fumentariae , accepit , atque haec ad eum latius atque inflatius Afranius perscribebat , se quoque ad motus fortunae movere coepit . <end>$$<start> But afterward , when he found that Caesar was detained before Massilia , that the forces of Petreius had effected a junction with the army of Afranius , that considerable reinforcements had come to their assistance , that there were great hopes and expectations , and heard that the whole Hither province had entered into a confederacy , and of the difficulties to which Caesar was reduced afterward at Ilerda for want of provisions , and Afranius wrote to him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these matters , he began to regulate his movements by those of fortune . <end>
<start> Frumenti magnum numerum coegit , quod Massiliensibus , item quod Afranio Petreioque mitteret . <end>$$<start> He himself Varro made severe harangues against Caesar . <end>
<start> Naves longas X Gaditanis ut facerent imperavit , complures praeterea Hispali faciendas curavit . <end>$$<start> He often pronounced from his tribunal that Caesar had fought several unsuccessful battles , and that a great number of his men had deserted to Afranius . <end>
<start> Cognitis eis rebus , quae sunt gestae in citeriore Hispania , bellum parabat . <end>$$<start> He was to retire with his two legions to Gades , and to lay up all the shipping and provisions there . <end>
<start> Ratio autem haec erat belli , ut se cum II legionibus Gades conferret , naves frumentumque omne ibi contineret ; provinciam enim omnem Caesaris rebus favere cognoverat . <end>$$<start> For he had been informed that the whole province was inclined to favor Caesar's party . <end>
<start> In insula frumento navibusque comparatis bellum duci non difficile existimabat . <end>$$<start> He thought that the war might be easily protracted in an island , if he was provided with corn and shipping . <end>
<start> Caesar , etsi multis necessariisque rebus in Italiam revocabatur , tamen constituerat nullam partem belli in Hispaniis relinquere , quod magna esse Pompei beneficia et magnas clientelas in citeriore provincia sciebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , although called back to Italy by many and important matters , yet had determined to leave no dregs of war behind him in Spain , because he knew that Pompey had many dependents and clients in the hither province . <end>
<start> Itaque duabus legionibus missis in ulteriorem Hispaniam cum Quintus Cassio , tribuno plebis , ipse DC cum equitibus magnis itineribus progreditur edictumque praemittit , ad quam diem magistratus principesque omnium civitatum sibi esse praesto Cordubae vellet . <end>$$<start> Having therefore sent two legions into Further Spain under the command of Quintus Cassius , tribune of the people ; he himself advances with six hundred horse by forced marches , and issues a proclamation , appointing a day on which the magistrates and nobility of all the states should attend him at Corduba . <end>
<start> Quo edicto tota provincia pervulgato nulla fuit civitas , quin ad id tempus partem senatus Cordubam mitteret , non civis Romanus paulo notior , quin ad diem conveniret . <end>$$<start> This proclamation being published through the whole province , there was not a state that did not send a part of their senate to Corduba , at the appointed time ; and not a Roman citizen of any note but appeared that day . <end>
<start> Simul ipse Cordubae conventus per se portas Varroni clausit , custodias vigiliasque in turribus muroque disposuit , cohortes duas , quae colonicae appellabantur , cum eo casu venissent , tuendi oppidi causa apud se retinuit . <end>$$<start> At the same time the senate at Corduba shut the gates of their own accord against Varro , and posted guards and sentinels on the wall and in the turrets , and detained two cohorts (called Colonicae , which had come there accidentally) , for the defense of the town . <end>
<start> Eisdem diebus Carmo nenses , quae est longe firmissima totius provinciae civitas , deductis tribus in arcem oppidi cobortibus a Varrone praesidio , per se cohortes eiecit portasque praeclusit . <end>$$<start> About the same time the people of Carmona , which is by far the strongest state in the whole province , of themselves drove out of the town the cohorts , and shut the gates against them , although three cohorts had been detached by Varro to garrison the citadel . <end>
<start> Hoc vero magis properare Varro , ut cum legionibus quam primum Gades contenderet , ne itinere aut traiectu intercluderetur : tanta ac tam secunda in Caesarem voluntas provinciae reperiebatur . <end>$$<start> But Varro was in greater haste on this account to reach Gades with his legion as soon as possible , lest he should be stopped either on his march or on crossing over to the island . <end>
<start> Progresso ei paulo longius litterae Gadibus redduntur : simulatque sit cognitum de edicto Caesaris , consensisse Gaditanos principes eum tribunis cohortium , quae essent ibi in praesidio , ut Gallonium ex oppido expellerent , urbem insulamque Caesari servarent . <end>$$<start> The affection of the province to Caesar proved so great and so favorable , that he received a letter from Gades , before he was far advanced on his march : that as soon as the nobility of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation , they had combined with the tribune of the cohorts , which were in garrison there , to drive Gallonius out of the town , and to secure the city and island for Caesar . <end>
<start> Hoc inito consilio denuntiavisse Gallonio , ut sua sponte , dum sine periculo liceret , excederet Gadibus ; si id non fecisset , sibi consilium capturos . <end>$$<start> That having agreed on the design they had sent notice to Gallonius , to quit Gades of his own accord while he could do it with safety ; if he did not , they would take measures for themselves ; that for fear of this Gallonius had been induced to quit the town . <end>
<start> Hoc timore adductum Gallonium Gadibus excessisse His cognitis rebus altera ex duabus legionibus , quae vernacula appellabatur , ex castris Varronis adstante et inspectante ipso signa sustulit seseque Hispalim recepit atque in foro et porticibus sine maleficio consedit . <end>$$<start> When this was known , one of Varro's two legions , which was called Vernacula , carried off the colors from Varro's camp , he himself standing by and looking on , and retired to Hispalis , and took post in the market and public places without doing any injury , and the Roman citizens residing there approved so highly of this act , that every one most earnestly offered to entertain them in their houses . <end>
<start> Quod factum adeo eius conventus cives Romani comprobaverunt , ut domum ad se quisque hospitio cupidissime reciperet . <end>$$<start> When Varro , terrified at these things , having altered his route , proposed going to Italica , he was informed by his friends that the gates were shut against him . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus perterritus Varro , cum itinere converso sese Italicam venturum praemisisset , certior ab suis factus est praeclusas esse portas . <end>$$<start> Then indeed , when intercepted from every road , he sends word to Caesar , that he was ready to deliver up the legion which he commanded . <end>
<start> Tum vero omni interclusus itinere ad Caesarem mittit , paratum se esse legionem , cui iusserit , tradere . <end>$$<start> He sends to him Sextus Caesar , and orders him to deliver it up to him . <end>
<start> Ille ad eum Sextum Caesarem mittit atque huic tradi iubet Tradita legione Varro Cordubam ad Caesarem venit ; relatis ad eum publicis cum fide rationibus quod penes eum est pecuniae tradit et , quid ubique habeat frumenti et navium , ostendit . <end>$$<start> Varro , having delivered up the legion , went to Caesar to Corduba , and having laid before him the public accounts , handed over to him most faithfully whatever money he had , and told him what quantity of corn and shipping he had , and where . <end>
<start> Caesar contione habita Cordubae omnibus generatim gratias agit : civibus Romanis , quod oppidum in sua potestate studuissent habere ; Hispanis , quod praesidia expulissent ; Gaditanis , quod conatus adversariorum infregissent seseque in libertatem vindicassent ; tribunis militum centurionibusque , qui eo praesidii causa venerant , quod eorum consilia sua virtute confirmassent . <end>$$<start> Caesar made a public oration at Corduba , in which he returned thanks to all severally : to the Roman citizens , because they had been zealous to keep the town in their own power ; to the Spaniards , for having driven out the garrison ; to the Gaditani , for having defeated the attempts of his enemies , and asserted their own liberty ; to the Tribunes and Centurions who had gone there as a guard , for having by their valor confirmed them in their purpose . <end>
<start> Pecunias , quas erant in publicum Varroni cives Romani polliciti , remittit ; bona restituit eis , quos liberius locutos hanc poenam tulisse cognoverat Tributis quibusdam populis publicis privatisque praemiis reliquos in posterum bona spe complet biduumque Cordubae commoratus Gades proficiscitur ; pecunias monumentaque , quae ex fano Herculis collata erant in privatam domum , referri in templum iubet . <end>$$<start> He remitted the tax which the Roman citizens had promised to Varro for the public use : he restored their goods to those who he was informed had incurred that penalty by speaking too freely , having given public and private rewards to some he filled the rest with flattering hopes of his future intentions ; and having staid two days at Corduba , he set out for Gades ; he ordered the money and ornaments which had been carried away from the temple of Hercules , and lodged in the houses of private persons , to be replaced in the temple . <end>
<start> Provinciae Quintus Cassium praeficit ; huic III legiones attribuit . <end>$$<start> He made Quintus Cassius governor of the province , and assigned him four legions . <end>
<start> Eadem ratione privatim ac publice quibusdam civitatibus habitis honoribus Tarracone discedit pedibusque Narbonem atque inde Massiliam perverit , Ibi legem de dictatore latam seseque dictatorem dictum a Marcus Lepido praetore cognoscit . <end>$$<start> There he was informed that a law was passed for creating a dictator , and that he had been nominated dictator by Marcus Lepidus the praetor . <end>
<start> Massilienses omnibus defessi malis , rei frumentariae ad summam inopiam adducti , bis navali proelio superati , crebris eruptionibus fusi , gravi etiam pestilentia conflictati ex diutina conclusione et mutatione victus (panico enim vetere atque hordeo corrupto omnes alebantur , quod ad huiusmodi casus antiquitus paratum in publicum contulerant) deiecta turri , labefacta magna parte muri , auxiliis provinciarum et exercituum desperatis , quos in Caesaris potestatem venisse cognoverant , sese dedere sine fraude constituunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians , wearied out by misfortunes of every sort , reduced to the lowest ebb for want of corn , conquered in two engagements at sea , defeated in their frequent sallies , and struggling moreover with a fatal pestilence , from their long confinement and change of victuals (for they all subsisted on old millet and damaged barley , which they had formerly provided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency of this kind) , their turret being demolished , a great part of their wall having given way , and despairing of any aid , either from the provinces or their armies , for these they had heard had fallen into Caesar's power , resolved to surrender now without dissimulation . <end>
<start> Sed paucis ante diebus Lucius Domitius cognita Massiliensium voluntate navibus III comparatis , ex quibus duas familiaribus suis attribuerat , unam ipse conscenderat nactus turbidam tempestatem profectus est . <end>$$<start> But a few days before , Lucius Domitius , having discovered the intention of the Massilians , and having procured three ships , two of which he gave up to his friends , went on board the third himself , having got a brisk wind , put out to sea . <end>
<start> Hunc conspicatae naves , quae iussu Bruti consuetudine cotidiana ad portum excubabant , sublatis ancoris sequi coeperunt . <end>$$<start> Some ships , which by Brutus's orders were constantly cruising near the port , having espied him , weighed anchor , and pursued him . <end>
<start> Ex his unum ipsius navigium contendit et fugere perseveravit auxilioque tempestatis ex conspectu abiit , duo perterrita concursu nostrarum navium sese in portum receperunt . <end>$$<start> But of these , the ship on board of which he was , persevered itself , and continuing its flight , and by the aid of the wind got out of sight : the other two , affrighted by the approach of our galleys put back again into the harbor . <end>
<start> Massilienses arma tormentaque ex oppido , ut est imperatum , proferunt , naves ex portu navalibusque educunt , pecuniam ex publico tradunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians conveyed their arms and engines out of the town , as they were ordered : brought their ships out of the port and docks , and delivered up the money in their treasury . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus confectis Caesar magis eos pro nomine et vetustate , quam pro meritis in se civitatis conservans duas ibi legiones praesidio relinquit , ceteras in Italiam mittit ; ipse ad urbem proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> When these affairs were dispatched , Caesar , sparing the town more out of regard to their renown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to his favor , left two legions in garrison there , sent the rest to Italy , and set out himself for Rome . <end>
<start> Eisdem temporibus Gaius Curio in Africam profectus ex Sicilia et iam ab initio copias Publius Attii Vari despiciens duas legiones ex IIII , quas a Caesare acceperat , D equites transportabat biduoque et noctibus tribus navigatione consumptis appellit ad eum locum , qui appellatur Anquillaria . <end>$$<start> About the same time Caius Curio , having sailed from Sicily to Africa , and from the first despising the forces of Publius Attius Varus , transported only two of the four legions which he had received from Caesar , and five hundred horse , and having spent two days and three nights on the voyage , arrived at a place called Aquilaria , which is about twenty-two miles distant from Clupea , and in the summer season has a convenient harbor , and is inclosed by two projecting promontories . <end>
<start> Hic locus abest a Clupeis passuum XXII milia habetque non incommodam aestate stationem et duobus eminentibus promuntoriis continetur Huius adventum Lucius Caesar filius cum X longis navibus ad Clupea praestolans , quas naves Uticae ex praedonum bello subductas Publius Attius reficiendas huius belli causa curaverat , veritus navium multitudinem ex alto refugerat appulsaque ad proximum litus trireme constrata et in litore relicta pedibus Adrumetum perfugerat . <end>$$<start> Lucius Caesar the son , who was waiting his arrival near Clupea with ten ships which had been taken near Utica in a war with the pirates , and which Publius Attius had had repaired for this war , frightened at the number of our ships , fled the sea , and running his three-decked covered galley on the nearest shore , left her there and made his escape by land to Adrumetum . <end>
<start> Id oppidum Gaius Considius Longus unius legionis praesidio tuebatur . <end>$$<start> Caius Considius Longus , with a garrison of one legion , guarded this town . <end>
<start> Reliquae Caesaris naves eius fuga se Adrumetum receperunt . <end>$$<start> The rest of Caesar's fleet , after his flight , retired to Adrumetum . <end>
<start> Hunc secutus Marcius Rufas quaestor navibus XII , quas praesidio onerariis navibus Curio ex Sicilia eduxerat , postquam in litore relictam navem conspexit , hanc remulco abstraxit ; ipse ad Gaius Curionem cum classe redit . <end>$$<start> Marcus Rufus , the quaestor , pursued him with twelve ships , which Curio had brought from Sicily as convoy to the merchantmen , and seeing a ship left on the shore , he brought her off by a towing rope , and returned with his fleet to Curio . <end>
<start> Curio Marcium Uticam navibus praemittit ; ipse eodem cum exercitu proficiscitur biduique iter progressus ad flumen Bagradam pervenit . <end>$$<start> Curio detached Marcus before with the fleet to Utica , and marched thither with his army . <end>
<start> Ibi Gaius Caninium Rebilum legatum cum legionibus reliquit ; ipse cum equitatu antecedit ad castra exploranda Cornelia , quod is locus peridoneus castris habebatur . <end>$$<start> Having advanced two days , he came to the river Bagrada , and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus , the lieutenant , with the legions ; and went forward himself with the horse to view the Cornelian camp , because that was reckoned a very eligible position for encamping . <end>
<start> Id autem est iugum directum eminens in mare , utraque ex parte praeruptum atque asperum , sed tamen paulo leniore fastigio ab ea parte , quae ad Uticam vergit . <end>$$<start> It is a straight ridge , projecting into the sea , steep and rough on both sides , but the ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite Utica . <end>
<start> Abest directo itinere ab Utica paulo amplius passuum milibus III . <end>$$<start> It is not more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line . <end>
<start> Sed hoc itinere est fons , quo mare succedit longius , lateque is locus restagnat ; quem si qui vitare voluerit , sex milium circuitu in oppidum pervenit . <end>$$<start> But on this road there is a spring , to which the sea comes up , and overflows ; an extensive morass is thereby formed ; and if a person would avoid it , he must make a circuit of six miles to reach the town . <end>
<start> Hoc explorato loco Curio castra Vari conspicit muro oppidoque coniuncta ad portam , quae appellatur Belica , admodum munita natura loci , una ex parte ipso oppido Utica , altero a theatro , quod est ante oppidum , substructionibus eius operis maximis , aditu ad castra difficili et angusto . <end>$$<start> Having examined this place , Curio got a view of Varus's camp , joining the wall and town , at the gate called Bellica , well fortified by its natural situation , on one side by the town itself , on the other by a theater which is before the town , the approaches to the town being rendered difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of that structure . <end>
<start> Simul animadvertit multa undique portari atque agi plenissimis viis , quae repentini tumultus timore ex agris in urbem conferantur . <end>$$<start> At the same time he observed the roads very full of carriages and cattle , which they were conveying from the country into the town on the sudden alarm . <end>
<start> Huc equitatum mittit , ut diriperet atque haberet loco praedae ; eodemque tempore his rebus subsidio DC Numidae ex oppido peditesque CCCC mittuntur a Varo , quos auxilii causa rex Iuba paucis diebus ante Uticam miserat . <end>$$<start> He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the spoil And at the same time Varus had detached as a guard for them six hundred Numidian horse , and four hundred foot , which king Juba had sent to Utica as auxiliaries a few days before . <end>
<start> Huic et paternum hospitium cum Pompeio et simultas cum Curione intercedebat , quod tribunus plebis legem promulgaverat , qua lege regnum Iubae publicaverat . <end>$$<start> There was a friendship subsisting between his Juba's father and Pompey , and a feud between him and Curio , because he , when a tribune of the people , had proposed a law , in which he endeavored to make public property of the kingdom of Juba . <end>
<start> Concurrunt equites inter se ; neque vero primum impetum nostrorum Numidae ferre potuerunt , sed interfectis circiter CXX reliqui se in castra ad oppidum receperunt . <end>$$<start> The horse engaged ; but the Numidians were not able to stand our first charge ; but a hundred and twenty being killed , the rest retreated into their camp near the town . <end>
<start> Interim adventu longarum navium Curio pronuntiare onerariis navibus iubet , quae stabant ad Uticam numero circiter CC , se in hostium habiturum loco , qui non e vestigio ad castra Cornelia naves traduxisset . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , on the arrival of his men of war , Curio ordered proclamation to be made to the merchant ships , which lay at anchor before Utica , in number about two hundred , that he would treat as enemies all that did not set sail immediately for the Cornelian camp . <end>
<start> Qua pronuntiatione facta temporis puncto sublatis ancoris omnes Uticam relinquunt et quo imperatum est transeunt . <end>$$<start> As soon as the proclamation was made , in an instant they all weighed anchor and left Utica , and repaired to the place commanded them . <end>
<start> Quae res omnium rerum copia complevit exercitum . <end>$$<start> This circumstance furnished the army with plenty of every thing . <end>
<start> His rebus gestis Curio se in castra ad Bagradam recipit atque universi exercitus conclamatione imperator appellatur posteroque die exercitum Uticam ducit et prope oppidum castra ponit . <end>$$<start> After these transactions , Curio returned to his camp to Bragada ; and by a general shout of the whole army was saluted imperator . <end>
<start> Nondum opere castrorum perfecto equites ex statione nuntiant magna auxilia equitum peditumque ab rege missa Uticam venire ; eodemque tempore vis magna pulveris cernebatur , et vestigio temporis primum agmen erat in conspectu . <end>$$<start> The next day he led his army to Utica , and encamped near the town Before the works of the camp were finished , the horse upon guard brought him word that a large supply of horse and foot sent by king Juba were on their march to Utica , and at the same time a cloud of dust was observed , and in a moment the front of the line was in sight . <end>
<start> Novitate rei Curio permotus praemittit equites , qui primum impetum sustineant ac morentur ; ipse celeriter ab opere deductis legionibus aciem instruit . <end>$$<start> Curio , surprised at the suddenness of the affair , sent on the horse to receive their first charge , and detain them . <end>
<start> Equitesque committunt proelium et , priusquam plane legiones explicari et consistere possent , tota auxilia regis impedita ac perturbata , quod nullo ordine et sine timore iter fecerant , in fugam coniciunt equitatuque omni fere incolumi , quod se per litora celeriter in oppidum recepit , magnum peditum numerum interficiunt . <end>$$<start> He immediately called off his legions from the work , and put them in battle array The horse began the battle : and before the legions could be completely marshaled and take their ground , the king's entire forces being thrown into disorder and confusion , because they had marched without any order , and were under no apprehensions , betake themselves to flight : almost all the enemy's horse being safe , because they made a speedy retreat into the town along the shore , Caesar's soldiers slay a great number of their infantry . <end>
<start> Proxima nocte centuriones Marsi duo ex castris Curionis cum manipularibus suis XXII ad Attium Varum perfugiunt . <end>$$<start> The next night two Marsian centurions with twenty-two men belonging to the companies , deserted from Curio's camp to Attius Varus . <end>
<start> Hi , sive vere quam habuerant opinionem ad eum perferunt , sive etiam auribus Vari serviunt (nam , quae volumus , et credimus libenter et , quae sentimus ipsi , reliquos sentire speramus) , confirmant quidem certe totius exercitus animos alienos esse a Curione maximeque opus esse in conspectum exercitus venire et colloquendi dare facultatem . <end>$$<start> They , whether they uttered the sentiments which they really entertained , or wished to gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give credit to , and what we think ourselves , we hope is the opinion of other men) , assured him , that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to Curio , that it was very expedient that the armies should be brought in view of each other , and an opportunity of a conference be given . <end>
<start> Qua opinione adductus Varus postero die mane legiones ex castris educit Facit idem Curio , atque una valle non magna interiecta suas uterque copias instruit . <end>$$<start> Induced by their opinion , Varus the next day led his troops out of the camp : Curio did so in like manner , and with only one small valley between them , each drew up his forces . <end>
<start> Erat in exercitu Vari Sextus Quintilius Varus , quem fuisse Corfinii supra demonstratum est . <end>$$<start> In Varus's army there was one Sextus Quintilius Varus who , as we have mentioned before , was at Corfinium . <end>
<start> Hic dimissus a Caesare in Africam venerat , legionesque eas traduxerat Curio , quas superioribus temporibus Corfinlo receperat Caesar , adeo ut paucis mutatis centurionibus eidem ordines manipulique constarent . <end>$$<start> When Caesar gave him his liberty , he went over to Africa ; now , Curio had transported to Africa those legions which Caesar had received under his command a short time before at Corfinium ; so that the officers and companies were still the same , excepting the change of a few centurions . <end>
<start> Hanc nactus appellationis causam Quintilius circuire aciem Curionis atque obsecrare milites coepit , ne primam sacramenti , quod apud Domitium atque apud se quaestorem dixissent , memoriam deponerent , neu contra eos arma ferrent , qui eadem essent usi fortuna eademque in obsidione perpessi , neu pro his pugnarent , a quibus cum contumelia perfugae appellarentur . <end>$$<start> Quintilius , making this a pretext for addressing them , began to go round Curio's lines , and to entreat the soldiers not to lose all recollection of the oath which they took first to Domitius and to him their quaestor , nor bear arms against those who had shared the same fortune , and endured the same hardships in a siege , nor fight for those by whom they had been opprobriously called deserters . <end>
<start> Huc pauca ad spem largitionis addidit , quae ab sua liberalitate , si se atque Attium secuti essent , exspectare deberent . <end>$$<start> To this he added a few words by way of encouragement , what they might expect from his own liberality , if they should follow him and Attius . <end>
<start> Hac habita oratione nullam in partem ab exercitu Curionis fit significatio , atque ita suas uterque copias reducit . <end>$$<start> On the delivery of this speech , no intimation of their future conduct is given by Curio's army , and thus both generals led back their troops to their camp . <end>
<start> Unusquisque enim opiniones fingebat et ad id , quod ab alio audierat , sui aliquid timoris addebat . <end>$$<start> These were the legions which a short time before had belonged to the enemy ; for the custom of offering free towns to those who joined the opposite party had changed Caesar's kindness . <end>
<start> Hoc ubi uno auctore ad plures permanaverat , atque alius alii tradiderat , plures auctores eius rei videbantur . <end>$$<start> For the harshest expressions of the soldiers in general did not proceed from the Marsi and Peligni , as those which passed in the tents the night before ; and some of their fellow soldiers heard them with displeasure . <end>
<start> Quibus de causis consilio convocato de summa rerum deliberare incipit . <end>$$<start> For these reasons , having called a council , Curio began to deliberate on the general welfare . <end>
<start> Erant sententiae , quae conandum omnibus modis castraque Vari oppugnanda censerent , quod in huiusmodi militum consiliis otium maxime contrarium esse arbitrarentur ; postremo praestare dicebant per virtutem in pugna belli fortunam experiri , quam desertos et circumventos ab suis gravissimum supplicium perpeti . <end>$$<start> In short , they said that it was better bravely to try the hazard of war in a battle , than to be deserted and surrounded by their own troops , and forced to submit to the greatest cruelties . <end>
<start> Curio utrumque improbans consilium , quantum alteri sententiae deesset animi , tantum alteri superesse dicebat : hos turpissimae fugae rationem habere , illos etiam iniquo loco dimicandum putare . <end>$$<start> Curio , censuring both measures , said , that the one was as deficient in spirit , as the other exceeded in it : that the latter advised a shameful flight , and the former recommended us to engage at a great disadvantage . <end>
<start> Qua enim , inquit , fiducia et opere et natura loci munitissima castra expugnari posse confidimus ? Aut vero quid proficimus , si accepto magno detrimento ab oppugnatione castrorum discedimus ? Quasi non et felicitas rerum gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et res adversae odia colligant! Castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et desperationem omnium et alienationem exercitus ? Nam neque pudentes suspicari oportet sibi parum credi , neque improbos scire sese timeri , quod his licentiam timor augeat noster , illis studia deminuat . <end>$$<start> For on what , says he , can we rely that we can storm a camp , fortified both by nature and art ? Or , indeed , what advantage do we gain if we give over the assault , after having suffered considerable loss ; as if success did not acquire for a general the affection of his army , and misfortune their hatred ? But what does a change of camp imply but a shameful flight and universal despair , and the alienation of the army ? For neither ought the obedient to suspect that they are distrusted , nor the insolent to know that we fear them ; because our fears augment the licentiousness of the latter , and diminish the zeal of the former . <end>
<start> Quod si iam , inquit , haec explorata habeamus , quae de exercitus alienatione dicuntur , quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione esse confido , quanto haec dissimulari et occultari , quam per nos confirmari praestet ? An non , uti corporis vulnera , ita exercitus incommoda sunt tegenda , ne spem adversariis augeamus ? At etiam , ut media nocte proficiscamur , addunt , quo maiorem , credo , licentiam habeant , qui peccare conentur . <end>$$<start> But if , says he , we were convinced of the truth of the reports of the disaffection of the army (which I indeed am confident are either altogether groundless , or at least less than they are supposed to be) , how much better to conceal and hide our suspicions of it , than by our conduct confirm it ? Ought not the defects of an army to be as carefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies , lest we should increase the enemy's hopes ? but they moreover advise us to set out at midnight , in order , I suppose , that those who attempt to do wrong may have a fairer opportunity ; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by shame or fear , to the display of which the night is most averse . <end>
<start> Namque huiusmodi res aut pudore aut metu tenentur ; quibus rebus nox maxime adversaria est Quare neque tanti sum animi , ut sine spe castra oppugnanda censeam , neque tanti timoris , uti spe deficiam , atque omnia prius experienda arbitror magnaque ex parte iam me una vobiscum de re iudicium facturum confido . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , I am neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack their camp without hopes of succeeding ; nor so influenced by fear as to despond : and I imagine that every expedient ought first to be tried ; and I am in a great degree confident that I shall form the same opinions as yourselves on this matter . <end>
<start> Commemorat , quo sit eorum usus studio ad Corfinium Caesar , ut magnam partem Italiae beneficio atque auctoritate eorum suam fecerit . <end>$$<start> For , says he , all the municipal towns afterward imitated you and your conduct ; nor was it without reason that Caesar judged so favorably , and the enemy so harshly of you . <end>
<start> Vos enim vestrumque factum omnia , inquit , deinceps municipia sunt secuta , neque sine causa et Caesar amicissime de vobis et illi gravissime iudicaverunt . <end>$$<start> For Pompey , though beaten in no engagement , yet was obliged to shift his ground , and leave Italy , from the precedent established by your conduct . <end>
<start> Pompeius enim nullo proelio pulsus vestri facti praeiudicio demotus Italia excessit ; Caesar me , quem sibi carissimum habuit , provinciam Siciliam atque Africam , sine quibus urbem atque Italiam tueri non potest , vestrae fidei commisit . <end>$$<start> Caesar commited me , whom he considered his dearest friend , and the provinces of Sicily and Africa , without which he was not able to protect Rome or Italy , to your protection . <end>
<start> Quid enim est illis optatius , quam uno tempore et nos circumvenire et vos nefario scelere obstringere ? aut quid irati gravius de vobis sentire possunt , quam ut eos prodatis , qui se vobis omnia debere iudicant , in eorum potestatem veniatis , qui se per vos perisse existimant ? An vero in Hispania res gestas Caesaris non audistis ? duos pulsos exercitus , duos superatos duces , duas receptas provincias ? haec acta diebus XL , quibus in conspectum adversariorum venerit Caesar ? An , qui incolumes resistere non potuerunt , perditi resistant ? vos autem incerta victoria Caesarem secuti diiudicata iam belli fortuna victum sequamini , cum vestri officii praemia percipere debeatis ? Desertos enim se ac proditos a vobis dicunt et prioris sacramenti mentionem faciunt . <end>$$<start> But did you desert Lucius Domitius , or did Lucius Domitius desert you ? Did he not , when you were ready to submit to the greatest difficulties , cast you off ? Did he not , without your privacy , endeavor to effect his own escape ? When you were betrayed by him , were you not preserved by Caesar's generosity ? And how could he think you bound by your oath to him , when , after having thrown up the ensigns of power , and abdicated his government , he became a private person , and a captive in another's power ? A new obligation is left upon you , that you should disregard the oath , by which you are at present bound ; and have respect only to that which was invalidated by the surrender of your general , and his diminution of rank . <end>
<start> Qui de meis in vos meritis praedicaturus non sum , quae sunt adhuc et mea voluntate et vestra exspectatione leviora ; sed tamen sui laboris milites semper eventu belli praemia petiverunt , qui qualis sit futurus , ne vos quidem dubitatis : diligentiam quidem nostram aut , quem ad finem adhuc res processit , fortunam cur praeteream ? An poenitet vos , quod salvum atque incolumem exercitum nulla omnino nave desiderata traduxerim ? quod classem hostium primo impetu adveniens profligaverim ? quod his per biduum equestri proelio superaverim ? quod ex portu sinuque adversariorum CC naves oneratas abduxerim eoque illos compulerim , ut neque pedestri itinere neque navibus commeatu iuvari possint ? Hac vos fortuna atque his ducibus repudiatis Corfiniensem ignominiam , Italiae fugam , Hispaniarum deditionem , Africi belli praeiudicia , sequimini! Equidem me Caesaris militem dici volui , vos me imperatoris nomine appellavistis . <end>$$<start> But why should I omit to mention my own diligence and good fortune , and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived ? Are you sorry that I transported the army safe and entire , without the loss of a single ship ? That on my arrival , in the very first attack , I routed the enemy's fleet ? That twice in two days I defeated the enemy's horse ? That I carried out of the very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy's victualers , and reduced them to that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or sea ? Will you divorce yourselves from this fortune and these generals ; and prefer the disgrace of Corfinium , the defeat of Italy , the surrender of both Spains , and the prestige of the African war ? I , for my part , wished to be called a soldier of Caesar's ; you honored me with the title of Imperator . <end>
<start> Cuius si vos poenitet , vestrum vobis beneficium remitto , mihi meum nomen restituite , ne ad contumeliam honorem dedisse videamini . <end>$$<start> If you repent your bounty , I give it back to you ; restore to me my former name that you may not appear to have conferred the honor on me as a reproach . <end>
<start> Qua oratione permoti milites crebro etiam dicentern interpellabant , ut magno cum dolore infidelitatis suspicionem sustinere viderentur , discedentem vero ex contione universi cohortantur , magno sit animo , necubi dubitet proelium committere et suam fidem virtutemque experiri . <end>$$<start> The soldiers , being affected by this oration , frequently attempted to interrupt him while he was speaking , so that they appeared to bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery , and when he was leaving the assembly they unanimously besought him to be of good spirits , and not hesitate to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and courage to a trial . <end>
<start> Quo facto commutata omnium et voluntate et opinione consensu summo constituit Curio , cum primum sit data potestas , proelio rem committere posteroque die productos eodem loco , quo superioribus diebus constiterat , in acie collocat . <end>$$<start> As the wishes and opinions of all were changed by this act , Curio , with the general consent , determined , whenever opportunity offered , to hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Erat vallis inter duas acies , ut supra demonstratum est , non ita magna , at difficili et arduo ascensu . <end>$$<start> There lay between the two armies a valley , as already mentioned , not very deep , but of a difficult and steep ascent . <end>
<start> Hanc uterque , si adversariorum copiae transire conarentur , exspectabat , quo aequiore loco proelium committeret . <end>$$<start> Each was waiting till the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it , that they might engage with the advantage of the ground . <end>
<start> Simul ab sinistro cornu Publius Attii equitatus omnis et una levis armaturae interiecti complures , cum se in vallem demitterent , cernebantur . <end>$$<start> At the same time on the left wing , the entire cavalry of Publius Attius , and several light-armed infantry intermixed with them , were perceived descending into the valley . <end>
<start> Ad eos Curio equitatum et duas Marrucinorum cohortes mittit ; quorum primum impetum equites hostium non tulerunt , sed admissis equis ad suos refugerunt ; relicti ab his , qui una procurrerant levis armaturae , circumveniebantur atque interficiebantur ab nostris . <end>$$<start> Against them Curio detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the Marrucini , whose first charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand , but , setting spurs to their horses , fled back to their friends : the light-infantry being deserted by those who had come out along with them , were surrounded and cut to pieces by our men . <end>
<start> Huc tota Vari conversa acies suos fugere et concidi videbat . <end>$$<start> Varus's whole army , facing that way , saw their men flee and cut down . <end>
<start> Tunc Rebilus , legatus Caesaris , quem Curio secum ex Sicilia duxerat , quod magnum habere usum in re militari sciebat , perterritum , inquit , hostem vides , Curio : quid dubitas uti temporis opportunitate ? Ille unum elocutus , ut memoria tenerent milites ea , quae pridie sibi confirmassent , sequi sese iubet et praecurrit ante omnes . <end>$$<start> Upon which Rebilus , one of Caesar's lieutenants , whom Curio had brought with him from Sicily knowing that he had great experience in military matters , cried out , You see the enemy are daunted , Curio! why do you hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity ? Curio , having merely expressed this , that the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which they had made to him the day before , then ordered them to follow him , and ran far before them all . <end>
<start> Adeo erat impedita vallis , ut in ascensu nisi sublevati a suis primi non facile eniterentur . <end>$$<start> The valley was so difficult of assent that the foremost men could not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind . <end>
<start> Sed praeoccupatus animus Attianorum militum timore et fuga et caede suorum nihil de resistendo cogitabat , omnesque se iam ab equitatu circumveniri arbitrabantur Itaque priusquam telum abici posset , aut nostri propius accederent , omnis Vari acies terga vertit seque in castra recepit . <end>$$<start> But the minds of Attius's soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the flight and slaughter of their men , never thought of opposing us ; and they all imagined that they were already surrounded by our horse , and , therefore , before a dart could be thrown , or our men come near them , Varus's whole army turned their backs and retreated to their camp . <end>
<start> Qua in fuga Fabius Pelignus quidam ex infimis ordinibus de exercitu Curionis primus agmen fugientium consecutus magna voce Varum nomine appellans requirebat , uti unus esse ex eius militibus et monere aliquid velle ac dicere videretur . <end>$$<start> In this flight one Fabius , a Pelignian common soldier in Curio's army , pursuing the enemy's rear , with a loud voice shouted to Varus by his name , and often called him , so that he seemed to be one of his soldiers , who wished to speak to him and give him advice . <end>
<start> Ubi ille saepius appellatus aspexit ac restitit et , quis esset aut quid vellet , quaesivit , umerum apertum gladio appetit paulumque afuit , quin Varum interficeret ; quod ille periculum sublato ad eius conatum scuto vitavit . <end>$$<start> When Varus , after been repeatedly called , stopped and looked at him , and inquired who he was and what he wanted , he made a blow with his sword at his naked shoulder and was very near killing Varus , but he escaped the danger by raising his shield to ward off the blow . <end>
<start> Sed cum loci natura et munitio castrorum aditum prohibebant , tum quod ad proelium egressi Curionis milites eis rebus indigebant , quae ad oppugnationem castrorum erant usui . <end>$$<start> But both the nature of the ground and the strength of the fortifications prevented our access to the camp ; for Curio's soldiers , marching out to battle , were without those things which were requisite for storming a camp . <end>
<start> Postero die Curio obsidere Uticam et vallo circummunire instituit . <end>$$<start> The next day Curio resolved to besiege Utica , and to draw lines about it . <end>
<start> Haec cum agerentur , nuntii praemissi ab rege Iuba venerunt , qui ilium adesse cum magnis copiis dicerent et de custodia ac defensione urbis hortarentur . <end>$$<start> The terror occasioned by former battles was very great ; and therefore , they openly talked of surrendering , and argued with Attius that he should not suffer the fortune of them all to be ruined by his obstinacy . <end>
<start> Nuntiabantur haec eadem Curioni , sed aliquamdiu fides fieri non poterat : tantam habebat suarum rerum fiduciam . <end>$$<start> The same intelligence was brought to Curio ; but for some time he could not give credit to it , because he had so great confidence in his own good fortune . <end>
<start> Iamque Caesaris in Hispania res secundae in Africam nuntiis ac litteris perferebantur . <end>$$<start> And at this time Caesar's success in Spain was announced in Africa by messages and letters . <end>
<start> Quibus omnibus rebus sublatus nihil contra se regem nisurum existimabat . <end>$$<start> Being elated by all these things , he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing against him . <end>
<start> Sed ubi certis auctoribus comperit minus V et XX milibus longe ab Utica eius copias abesse , relictis munitionibus sese in castra Cornelia recepit . <end>$$<start> But when he found out , from undoubted authority , that his forces were less than twenty miles distant from Utica , abandoning his works , he retired to the Cornelian camp . <end>
<start> Huc frumentum comportare , castra munire , materiam conferre coepit statimque in Siciliam misit , uti duae legiones reliquusque equitatus ad se mitteretur . <end>$$<start> Here he began to lay in corn and wood , and to fortify his camp , and immediately dispatched orders to Sicily , that his two legions and the remainder of his cavalry should be sent to him . <end>
<start> Castra erant ad bellum ducendum aptissima natura loci et munitione et maris propinquitate et aquae et salis copia , cuius magna vis iam ex proximis erat salinis eo congesta . <end>$$<start> His camp was well adapted for protracting a war , from the nature and strength of the situation , from its proximity to the sea , and the abundance of water and salt , of which a great quantity had been stored up from the neighboring salt-pits . <end>
<start> Non materia multitudine arborum , non frumentum , euius erant plenissimi agri , deficere poterat . <end>$$<start> Timber could not fail him from the number of trees , nor corn , with which the lands abounded . <end>
<start> Itaque omnium suorum consensu Curio reliquas copias exspectare et bellum ducere parabat . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , with the general consent , Curio determined to wait for the rest of his forces , and protract the war . <end>
<start> His constitutis rebus probatisque consiliis ex perfugis quibusdam oppidanis audit Iubam revocatum finitimo bello et controversiis Leptitanorum restitisse in regno , Saburram , eius praefectum , cum mediocribus copiis missum Uticae appropinquare . <end>$$<start> This plan being settled , and his conduct approved of , he is informed by some deserters from the town that Juba had staid behind in his own kingdom , being called home by a neighboring war , and a dispute with the people of Leptis ; and that Sabura , his commander-in-chief , who had been sent with a small force , was drawing near to Utica . <end>
<start> His auctoribus temere credens consilium commutat et proelio rem committere constituit . <end>$$<start> Curio rashly believing this information , altered his design , and resolved to hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Multum ad hanc rem probandam adiuvat adulescentia , magnitudo animi , superioris temporis proventus , fiducia rei bene gerendae . <end>$$<start> His youth , his spirits , his former good fortune and confidence of success , contributed much to confirm this resolution . <end>
<start> His rebus impulsus equitatum omnem prima nocte ad castra hostium mittit ad flumen Bagradam , quibus praeerat Saburra , de quo ante erat auditum ; sed rex omnibus copiis insequebatur et sex milium passuum intervallo a Saburra consederat . <end>$$<start> Induced by these motives , early in the night he sent all his cavalry to the enemy's camp near the river Bagrada , of which Sabura , of whom we have already spoken , was the commander . <end>
<start> Equites missi nocte iter conficiunt , imprudentes atque inopinantes hostes aggrediuntur . <end>$$<start> But the king was coming after them with all his forces , and was posted at a distance of six miles behind Sabura . <end>
<start> Hos oppressos somno et dispersos adorti magnum eorum numerum interficiunt ; multi perterriti profugiunt . <end>$$<start> The cavalry having attacked them , when sunk in sleep and dispersed , killed a great number of them ; many were frightened and ran away . <end>
<start> Quo facto ad Curionem equites revertuntur captivosque ad eum reducunt . <end>$$<start> After which the horse returned to Curio , and brought some , prisoners with them . <end>
<start> Curio cum omnibus copiis quarta vigilia exierat cohortibus V castris praesidio relictis . <end>$$<start> Curio had set out at the fourth watch with all his forces , except five cohorts which he left to guard the camp . <end>
<start> Progressus milia passuum VI equites convenit , rem gestam cognovit ; e captivis quaerit , quis castris ad Bagradam praesit : respondent Saburram . <end>$$<start> Having advanced six miles , he met the horse , heard what had happened and inquired from the captives who commanded the camp at Bagrada . <end>
<start> Reliqua studio itineris conficiendi quaerere praetermittit proximaque respiciens signa , videtisne , inquit , milites , captivorum orationem cum perfugis convenire ? abesse regem , exiguas esse copias missas , quae paucis equitibus pares esse non potuerint ? Proinde ad praedam , ad gloriam properate , ut iam de praemiis vestris et de referenda gratia cogitare incipiamus . <end>$$<start> They replied Sabura Through eagerness to perform his journey , he neglected to make further inquiries , but looking back to the company next him , Don't you see , soldiers , says he , that the answer of the prisoners corresponds with the account of the deserters , that the king is not with him , and that he sent only a small force which was not able to withstand a few horse ? Hasten then to spoil , to glory ; that we may now begin to think of rewarding you , and returning you thanks . <end>
<start> Erant per se magna , quae gesserant equites , praesertim cum eorum exiguus numerus cum tanta multitudine Numidarum confertur . <end>$$<start> The achievements of the horse were great in themselves , especially if their small number be compared with the vast host of Numidians . <end>
<start> Haec tamen ab ipsis inflatius commemorabantur , ut de suis homines laudibus libenter praedicant . <end>$$<start> However , the account was enlarged by themselves , as men are naturally inclined to boast of their own merit . <end>
<start> Multa praeterea spolia praeferebantur , capti homines equique producebantur , ut , quicquid intercederet temporis , hoc omne victoriam morari videretur . <end>$$<start> Besides , many spoils were produced ; the men and horses that were taken were brought into their sight , that they might imagine that every moment of time which intervened was a delay to their conquest . <end>
<start> Ita spei Curionis militum studia non deerant . <end>$$<start> By this means the hope of Curio were seconded by the ardor of the soldiers . <end>
<start> Equites sequi iubet sese iterque accelerat , ut quam maxime ex fuga perterritos adoriri posset . <end>$$<start> He ordered the horse to follow him , and hastened his march , that he might attack them as soon as possible , while in consternation after their flight . <end>
<start> At illi itinere totius noctis confecti subsequi non poterant , atque alii alio loco resistebant . <end>$$<start> But the horse , fatigued by the expedition of the preceding night , were not able to keep up with him , but fell behind in different places . <end>
<start> Ne haec quidem Curionem ad spem morabantur . <end>$$<start> Even this did not abate Curio's hopes . <end>
<start> Iuba certior factus a Saburra de nocturno proelio II milia Hispanorum et Gallorum equitum , quos suae custodiae causa circum se habere consuerat , et peditum eam partem , cui maxime confidebat , Saburrae submisit ; ipse cum reliquis copiis elephantisque LX lentius subsequitur . <end>$$<start> Juba , being informed by Sabura of the battle in the night , sent to his relief two thousand Spanish and Gallic horse , which he was accustomed to keep near him to guard his person , and that part of his infantry on which he had the greatest dependence , and he himself followed slowly after with the rest of his forces and forty elephants , suspecting that as Curio had sent his horse before , he himself would follow them . <end>
<start> Suspicatus praemissis equitibus ipsum affore Curionem Saburra copias equitum peditumque instruit atque his imperat , ut simulatione timoris paulatim cedant ac pedem referant : sese , cum opus esset , signum proelii daturum et , quod rem postulare cognovisset , imperaturum . <end>$$<start> Sabura drew up his army , both horse and foot , and commanded them to give way gradually and retreat through the pretense of fear ; that when it was necessary he would give them the signal for battle , and such orders as he found circumstances required . <end>
<start> Curio ad superiorem spem addita praesentis temporis olninione , hostes fugere arbitratus copias ex locis superioribus in campum deducit . <end>$$<start> Curio , as his idea of their present behavior was calculated to confirm his former hopes , imagined that the enemy were running away , and led his army from the rising grounds down to the plain . <end>
<start> Quibus ex locis cum longius esset progressus , confecto iam labore exercitu XII milium spatio constitit . <end>$$<start> And when he had advanced from this place about sixteen miles , his army being exhausted with the fatigue , he halted . <end>
<start> Dat suis signum Saburra , aciem constituit et circumire ordines atque hortari incipit ; sed peditatu dumtaxat procul ad speciem utitur , equites in aciem immittit . <end>$$<start> Sabura gave his men the signal , marshaled his army , and began to go around his ranks and encourage them . <end>
<start> Ne militibus quidem ut defessis neque equitibus ut paucis et labore confectis studium ad pugnandum virtusque deerat ; sed hi erant numero CC , reliqui in itinere substiterant . <end>$$<start> Neither were the soldiers , though wearied , nor the horse , though few and exhausted with fatigue , deficient in ardor to engage , and courage : but the latter were in number but two hundred : the rest had dropped behind on the march . <end>
<start> Hi , quamcumque in partem impetum fecerant , hostes loco cedere cogebant , sed neque longius fugientes prosequi neque vehementius equos incitare poterant . <end>$$<start> Wherever they charged they forced the enemy to give ground , but they were not able to pursue them far when they fled , or to press their horses too severely . <end>
<start> At equitatus hostium ab utroque cornu circuire aciem nostram et aversos proterere incipit . <end>$$<start> Besides , the enemy's cavalry began to surround us on both wings and to trample down our rear . <end>
<start> Cum cohortes ex acie procucurrissent , Numidae integri celeritate impetum nostrorum effugiebant rurusque ad ordines suos se recipientes circuibant et ab acie excludebant . <end>$$<start> When any cohorts ran forward out of the line , the Numidians , being fresh , by their speed avoided our charge , and surrounded ours when they attempted to return to their post , and cut them off from the main body . <end>
<start> Sic neque in loco manere ordinesque servare neque procurrere et casum subire tutum videbatur . <end>$$<start> So that it did not appear safe either to keep their ground and maintain their ranks , or to issue from the line , and run the risk . <end>
<start> Hostium copiae submissis ab rege auxiliis crebro augebantur ; nostros vires lassitudine deficiebant , simul ei , qui vulnera acceperant , neque acie excedere neque in locum tutum referri poterant , quod tota acies equitatu hostium circumdata tenebatur . <end>$$<start> The enemy's troops were frequently reinforced by assistance sent from Juba ; strength began to fail our men through fatigue ; and those who had been wounded could neither quit the field nor retire to a place of safety , because the whole field was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry . <end>
<start> Hi de sua salute desperantes , ut extremo vitae tempore homines facere consuerunt , aut suam mortem miserabantur aut parentes suos commendabant , si quos ex eo periculo fortuna servare potuisset . <end>$$<start> Therefore , despairing of their own safety , as men usually do in the last moment of their lives , they either lamented their unhappy deaths , or recommended their parents to the survivors , if fortune should save any from the impending danger . <end>
<start> Plena erant omnia timoris et luctus . <end>$$<start> All were full of fear and grief . <end>
<start> Curio , ubi perterritis omnibus neque cohortationes suas neque preces audiri intellegit , unam ut in miseris rebus spem reliquam salutis esse arbitratus , proximos colles capere universos atque eo signa inferri iubet . <end>$$<start> When Curio perceived that in the general consternation neither his exhortations nor entreaties were attended to , imagining that the only hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to gain the nearest hills , he ordered the colors to be borne that way . <end>
<start> Tum vero ad summam desperationem nostri perveniunt et partim fugientes ab equitatu interficiuntur , partim integri procumbunt . <end>$$<start> But a party of horse , that had been sent by Sabura , had already got possession of them . <end>
<start> Hortatur Curionem Gnaeus Domitius , praefectus equitum , cum paucis equitibus circumsistens , ut fuga salutem petat atque in castra contendat , et se ab eo non discessurum pollicetur . <end>$$<start> Now indeed our men were reduced to extreme despair : and some of them were killed by the cavalry in attempting to escape : some fell to the ground unhurt . <end>
<start> At Curio numquam se amisso exercitu , quem a Caesare fidei commissum acceperit , in eius conspectum reversurum confirmat atqne ita proelians interficitur . <end>$$<start> Cneius Domitius , commander of the cavalry , standing round Curio with a small party of horse , urged Curio to endeavor to escape by flight , and to hasten to his camp ; and assured him that he would not forsake him . <end>
<start> Equites ex proelio perpauci se recipiunt ; sed ei , quos ad novissimum agmen equorum reficiendorum causa substitisse demonstratum est , fuga totius exercitus procul animadversa sese incolumes in castra conferunt . <end>$$<start> But Curio declared that he would never more appear in Caesar's sight , after losing the army which had been committed by Caesar , to his charge , and accordingly fought till he was killed . <end>
<start> His rebus cognitis Marcius Rufus quaestor in castris relictus a Curione cohortatur suos , ne animo deficiant . <end>$$<start> The soldiers were all killed to a man Marcus Rufus , the quaestor , who was left behind in the camp by Curio , having got intelligence of these things , encouraged his men not to be disheartened . <end>
<start> Illi orant atque obsecrant , ut in Siciliam navibus reportentur . <end>$$<start> They beg and entreat to be transported to Sicily . <end>
<start> Pollicetur magistrisque imperat navium , ut primo vespere omnes scaphas ad litus appulsas habeant . <end>$$<start> He consented , and ordered the masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore early in the evening . <end>
<start> Sed tantus fuit omnium terror , ut alii adesse copias Iubae dicerent , alii cum legionibus instare Varum iamque se pulverem venientium cernere , quarum rerum nihil omnino acciderat , alii classem hostium celeriter advolaturam suspicarentur . <end>$$<start> But so great was the terror in general , that some said that Juba's forces were marching up , others that Varus was hastening with his legions , and that they already saw the dust raised by their coming ; of which not one circumstance had happened : others suspected that the enemy's fleet would immediately be upon them . <end>
<start> Itaque perterritis omnibus sibi quisque consulebat . <end>$$<start> Therefore in the general consternation , every man consulted his own safety . <end>
<start> Horum fuga navium onerariarum magistros incitabat ; pauci lenunculi ad officium imperiumque conveniebant . <end>$$<start> A few small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders . <end>
<start> Sed tanta erat completis litoribus contentio , qui potissimum ex magno numero conscenderent , ut multitudine atque onere nonnulli deprimerentur , reliqui hoc timore propius adire tardarentur . <end>$$<start> But as the shores were crowded , so great was the struggle to determine who of such a vast number should first get on board , that some of the vessels sank with the weight of the multitude , and the fears of the rest delayed them from coming to the shore . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus accidit , ut pauci milites patresque familiae , qui aut gratia aut misericordia valerent aut naves adnare possent , recepti in Siciliam incolumes pervenirent . <end>$$<start> From which circumstances it happened that a few foot and aged men , that could prevail either through interest or pity , or who were able to swim to the ships , were taken on board , and landed safe in Sicily . <end>
<start> Ipse equo in oppidum vectus prosequentibus compluribus senatoribus , quo in numero erat Ser Sulpicius et Licinius Damasippus paucis , quae fieri vellet , Uticae constituit atque imperavit diebusque post paucis se in regnum cum omnibus copiis recepit . <end>$$<start> But Juba the next day having spied their cohorts before the town , claimed them as his booty , and ordered great part of them to be put to the sword ; a few he selected and sent home to his own realm . <end>&&&&
