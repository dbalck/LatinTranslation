<start> Dictatore habente comitia Caesare consules creantur Iulius Caesar et Publius Servilius : is enim erat annus , quo per leges ei consulem fieri liceret . <end>$$<start> Julius Caesar , holding the election as dictator , was himself appointed consul with Publius Servilius ; for this was the year in which it was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul . <end>
<start> His rebus confectis , cum fides tota Italia esset angustior neque creditae pecuniae solverentur , constituit , ut arbitri darentur ; per eos fierent aestimationes possessionum et rerum , quanti quaeque earum ante bellum fuisset , atque hac creditoribus traderentur . <end>$$<start> This business being ended , as credit was beginning to fail in Italy , and the debts could not be paid , he determined that arbitrators should be appointed : and that they should make an estimate of the possessions and properties of the debtors , how much they were worth before the war , and that they should be handed over in payment to the creditors . <end>
<start> Hoc et ad timorem novarum tabularum tollendum minuendumve , qui fere bella et civiles dissensiones sequi consuevit , et ad debitorum tuendam existimationem esse aptissimum existimavit . <end>$$<start> This he thought the most likely method to remove and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt , the usual consequence of civil wars and dissensions , and to support the credit of the debtors . <end>
<start> Itemque praetoribus tribunisque plebis rogationes ad populum ferentibus nonnullos ambitus Pompeia lege damnatos illis temporibus , quibus in urbe praesidia legionum Pompeius habuerat , quae iudicia aliis audientibus iudicibus , aliis sententiam ferentibus singulis diebus erant perfecta , in integrum restituit , qui se illi initio civilis belli obtulerant , si sua opera in bello uti vellet , proinde aestimans , ac si usus esset , quoniam aui fecissent potestatem . <end>$$<start> He likewise restored to their former condition (the praetors and tribunes , first submitting the question to the people) some persons condemned for bribery at the elections , by virtue of Pompey's law , at the time when Pompey kept his legions quartered in the city (these trials were finished in a single day , one judge hearing the merits , and another pronouncing the sentences) , because they had offered their service to him in the beginning of the civil war , if he chose to accept them ; setting the same value on them as if he had accepted them , because they had put themselves in his power . <end>
<start> Statuerat enim prius hos iudicio populi debere restitui , quam suo beneficio videri receptos , ne aut ingratus in referenda gratia aut arrogans in praeripiendo populi beneficio videretur . <end>$$<start> For he had determined that they ought to be restored rather by the judgment of the people than appear admitted to it by his bounty : that he might neither appear ungrateful in repaying an obligation , nor arrogant in depriving the people of their prerogative of exercising this bounty . <end>
<start> His rebus et feriis Latinis comitiisque omnibus perficiendis XI dies tribuit dictaturaque se abdicat et ab urbe proficiscitur Brundisiumque pervenit . <end>$$<start> In accomplishing these things , and celebrating the Latin festival , and holding all the elections , he spent eleven days ; and having resigned the dictatorship , set out from the city , and went to Brundusium , where he had ordered twelve legions and all his cavalry to meet him . <end>
<start> Eo legiones XII , equitatum omnem venire iusserat Sed tantum navium repperit , ut anguste XV milia legionariorum militum , DC equites transportari possent . <end>$$<start> But he scarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to transport fifteen thousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse . <end>
<start> Atque hae ipsae copiae hoc infrequentiores imponuntur , quod multi Gallicis tot bellis defecerant , longumque iter ex Hispania magnum numerum deminuerat , et gravis autumnus in Apulia circumque Brundisium ex saluberrimis Galliae et Hispaniae regionibus omnem exercitum valetudine temptaverat . <end>$$<start> And even these troops embarked very short of their number , because several had fallen in so many wars in Gaul , and the long march from Spain had lessened their number very much , and a severe autumn in Apulia and the district about Brundusium , after the very wholesome countries of Spain and Gaul , had impaired the health of the whole army . <end>
<start> Legiones effecerat civium Romanorum VIIII : V ex Italia , quas traduxerat ; unam ex Cilicia veteranam , quam factam ex duabus gemellam appellabat ; unam ex Creta et Macedonia ex veteranis militibus , qui dimissi a superioribus imperatoribus in his provinciis consederant ; duas ex Asia , quas Lentulus consul conscribendas curaverat . <end>$$<start> He had made up nine legions of Roman citizens ; five from Italy , which he had brought with him ; one veteran legion from Sicily , which being composed of two he called the Gemella ; one from Crete and Macedonia , of veterans who had been discharged by their former generals and had settled in those provinces ; two from Asia , which had been levied by the activity of Lentulus . <end>
<start> Praeterea magnum numerum ex Thessalia , Boeotia , Achaia Epiroque supplementi nomine in legiones distribuerat : his Antonianos milites admiscuerat . <end>$$<start> Besides , he had distributed among his legions a considerable number , by way of recruits , from Thessaly , Boeotia , Achaia , and Epirus : with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken from Caius Antonius . <end>
<start> Sagittarios Creta , Lacedaemone , ex Ponto atque Syria reliquisque civitatibus III milia numero habebat , funditorum cohortes sescenarias II , equitum VII milia . <end>$$<start> Two hundred were sent from Syria by Comagenus Antiochus , whom Pompey rewarded amply . <end>
<start> Huc Dardanos , Bessos partim mercenarios , partim imperio aut gratia comparatos , item Macedones , Thessalos ac reliquarum gentium et civitatum adiecerat atque eum , quem supra demonstravimus , numerum expleverat . <end>$$<start> To these were added Dardanians and Bessians , some of them mercenaries ; others procured by power and influence : also , Macedonians , Thessalians , and troops from other nations and states , which completed the number which we mentioned before . <end>
<start> Frumenti vim maximam ex Thessalia , Asia , Aegypto , Creta , Cyrenis reliquisque regionibus comparaverat . <end>$$<start> He had laid in vast quantities of corn from Thessaly , Asia , Egypt , Crete , Cyrene , and other countries . <end>
<start> Hiemare Dyrrachii , Apolloniae omnibusque oppidis maritimis constituerat , ut mare transire Caesarem prohiberet , eiusque rei causa omni ora maritima classem disposuerat . <end>$$<start> He had resolved to fix his winter quarters at Dyrrachium , Apollonia , and the other seaports , to hinder Caesar from passing the sea : and for this purpose had stationed his fleet along the sea-coast . <end>
<start> Laelius et Gaius Triarius , Syriacis Gaius Cassius , Rhodiis Gaius Marcellus cum Gaius Coponio , Liburnicae atque Achaicae classi Scribonius Libo et Marcus Octavius . <end>$$<start> But Marcus Bibulus was appointed commander-in-chief of the whole maritime department , and regulated every matter . <end>
<start> Caesar , ut Brundisium venit , contionatus apud milites , quoniam prope ad finem laborum ac periculorum esset perventum , aequo animo mancipia atque impedimenta in Italia relinquerent , ipsi expediti naves conscenderent , quo maior numerus militum posset imponi , omniaque ex victoria et ex sua liberalitate sperarent , conclamantibus omnibus , imperaret , quod vellet , quodcumque imperavisset , se aequo animo esse facturos , II . <end>$$<start> When Caesar came to Brundusium , he made a speech to the soldiers : That since they were now almost arrived at the termination of their toils and dangers , they should patiently submit to leave their slaves and baggage in Italy , and to embark without luggage , that a greater number of men might be put on board : that they might expect every thing from victory and his liberality . <end>
<start> Non Ian naves solvit Impositae , ut supra demonstratum est , legiones VII . <end>$$<start> They cried out with one voice , he might give what orders he pleased , that they would cheerfully fulfill them . <end>
<start> Inter Cerauniorum saxa et alia loca periculosa quietam nactus stationem et portus omnes timens , quos teneri ab adversariis arbitrabatur , ad eum locum , qui appellabatur Palaeste , omnibus navibus ad unam incolumibum milites euit . <end>$$<start> The next day he reached land , between the Ceraunian rocks and other dangerous places ; meeting with a safe road for his shipping to ride in , and dreading all other ports which he imagined were in possession of the enemy , he landed his men at a place called Pharsalus , without the loss of a single vessel . <end>
<start> Erat Orici Lucretius Vespillo et Minucius Rufus cum Asiaticis navibus XVIII , quibus iussu D Laelii praeerant , Marcus Bibulus cum navibus ex Corcyrae . <end>$$<start> Lucretius Vespillo and Minutius Rufus were at Oricum , with eighteen Asiatic ships , which were given into their charge by the orders of Decimus Laelius : Marcus Bibulus at Corcyra , with a hundred and ten ships . <end>
<start> Sed neque illi sibi confisi ex portu prodire sunt ausi , cum Caesar omnino XII naves longas praesidio duxisset , in quibus erant constratae IIII , neque Bibulus impeditis navibus dispersisque remigibus satis mature occurrit , quod prius ad continentem visus est Caesar , quam de eius adventu fama omnino in eas regiones perferretur . <end>$$<start> But they had not the confidence to dare to move out of the harbor ; though Caesar had brought only twelve ships as a convoy , only four of which had decks ; nor did Bibulus , his fleet being disordered and his seamen dispersed , come up in time : for Caesar was seen at the continent , before any account whatsoever of his approach had reached those regions . <end>
<start> Eitis militibus naves eadem nocte Brundisium a Caesare remittuntur , ut reliquae legiones equitatusque transportari possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having landed his soldiers , sent back his ships the same night to Brundusium , to transport the rest of his legions and cavalry . <end>
<start> Huic officio praepositus erat Fufius Calenus legatus , qui celeritatem in transportandis legionibus adhiberet . <end>$$<start> The charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius Kalenus , with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions . <end>
<start> Sed serius a terra provectae naves neque usae nocturna aura in redeundo offenderunt . <end>$$<start> But the ships having put to sea too late , and not having taken advantage of the night breeze , fell a sacrifice on their return . <end>
<start> Bibulus enim Corcyrae certior factus de adventu Caesaris , sperans alicui se parti onustarum navium occurrere posse , inanibus occurrit et nactus circiter XXX in eas indiligentiae suae ac doloris iracundiam erupit omnesque incendit eodemque igne nautas dominosque navium interfecit , magnitudine poenae reliquos terreri sperans . <end>$$<start> For Bibulus at Corcyra , being informed of Caesar's approach , hoped to fall in with some part of our ships , with their cargoes , but found them empty ; and having taken about thirty , vented on them his rage at his own remissness , and set them all on fire : and , with the same flames , he destroyed the mariners and masters of the vessels , hoping by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest . <end>
<start> Discessu Liburnarum ex Illyrico Marcus Octavius cum eis , quas habebat , navibus Salonas pervenit Ibi concitatis Dalmatis reliquisque barbaris Issam a Caesaris amicitia avertit ; conventurn Salonis cum neque pollicitationibus neque denuntiatione periculi permovere posset , oppidum oppugnare instituit . <end>$$<start> But after the departure Of the Liburnian fleet , Marcus Octavius sailed from Illyricum with what ships he had to Salona , and having spirited up the Dalmatians , and other barbarous nations , he drew Issa off from its connection with Caesar ; but not being able to prevail with the council of Salona , either by promises or menaces , he resolved to storm the town . <end>
<start> Est autem oppidum et loci natura et colle munitum . <end>$$<start> But it was well fortified by its natural situation and a hill . <end>
<start> Sed celeriter cives Romani ligneis effectis turribus his sese munierunt et , cum essent infirmi ad resistendum propter paucitatem hominum crebris confecti vulneribus , ad extremum auxilium descenderunt servosque omnes puberes liberaverunt et praesectis omnium mulierum crinibus tormenta effecerunt . <end>$$<start> The Roman citizens built wooden towers , the better to secure it ; but when they were unable to resist , on account of the smallness of their numbers , being weakened by several wounds , they stooped to the last resource , and set at liberty all the slaves old enough to bear arms ; and cutting the hair off the women's heads , made ropes for their engines . <end>
<start> Quorum cognita sententia Octavius quinis castris oppidum circumdedit atque uno tempore obsidione et oppugnationibus eos premere coepit . <end>$$<start> Octavius , being informed of their determination , surrounded the town with five encampments , and began to press them at once with a siege and storm . <end>
<start> Illi omnia perpeti parati maxime a re frumentaria laborabant . <end>$$<start> They were determined to endure every hardship , and their greatest distress was the want of corn . <end>
<start> Cui rei missis ad Caesarem legatis auxilium ab eo petebant ; reliqua , ut poterant , incommoda per se sustinebant Et longo interposito spatio cum diuturnitas oppugnationis neglegentiores Octavianos effecisset , nacti occasionem meridiani temporis discessu eorum pueris mulieribusque in muro dispositis , ne quid cotidianae consuetudinis desideraretur , ipsi manu facta cum eis , quos nuper liberaverant , in proxima Octavii castra irruperunt . <end>$$<start> They , therefore , sent deputies to Caesar , and begged a supply from him ; all other inconveniences they bore by their own resources , as well as they could : and after a long interval , when the length of the siege had made Octavius's troops more remiss than usual , having got an opportunity at noon , when the enemy were dispersed , they disposed their wives and children on the walls , to keep up the appearance of their usual attention ; and forming themselves into one body , with the slaves whom they had lately enfranchised , they made an attack on Octavius's nearest camp , and having forced that , attacked the second with the same fury ; and then the third and the fourth , and then the other , and beat them from them all : and having killed a great number , obliged the rest and Octavius himself to fly for refuge to their ships . <end>
<start> Iamque hiems appropinquabat , et tantis detrimentis acceptis Octavius desperata oppugnatione oppidi Dyrrachium sese ad Pompeium recepit . <end>$$<start> Winter was now approaching , and Octavius , despairing of capturing the town , after sustaining such considerable losses , withdrew to Pompey , to Dyrrachium . <end>
<start> Demonstravimus Lucius Vibullium Rufum , Pompei praefectum , bis in potestatem pervenisse Caesaris atque ab eo esse dimissum , semel ad Corfinium , iterum in Hispania . <end>$$<start> We have mentioned , that Vibullius Rufus , an officer of Pompey's had fallen twice into Caesar's power ; first at Corfinium , and afterward in Spain . <end>
<start> Hunc pro suis beneficiis Caesar idoneum iudicaverat , quem cum mandatis ad Gnaeus Pompeium mitteret , eundemque apud Gnaeus Pompeium auctoritatem habere intellegebat Erat autem haec summa mandatorum : debere utrumque pertinaciae finem facere et ab armis discedere neque amplius fortunam periclitari . <end>$$<start> Caesar thought him a proper person , on account of his favors conferred on him , to send with proposals to Pompey : and he knew that he had an influence over Pompey . <end>
<start> Satis esse magna utrimque incommoda accepta , quae pro disciplina et praeceptis habere possent , ut reliquos casus timerent : ilium Italia expulsum amissa Sicilia et Sardinia duabusque Hispaniis et cohortibus in Italia atque Hispania civium Romanorum centum atque XXX ; se morte Curionis et detrimento Africani exercitus tanto militumque deditione ad Curictam . <end>$$<start> This was the substance of his proposals : That it was the duty of both , to put an end to their obstinacy , and forbear hostilities , and not tempt fortune any further ; that sufficient loss had been suffered on both sides , to serve as a lesson and instruction to them , to render them apprehensive of future calamities , by Pompey , in having been driven out of Italy , and having lost Sicily , Cardinia , and the two Spains , and one hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens , in Italy and Spain : by himself , in the death of Curio , and the loss of so great an army in Africa , and the surrender of his soldiers in Corcyra . <end>
<start> Proinde sibi ac rei publicae parcerent , cum , quantum in bello fortuna posset , iam ipsi incommodis suis satis essent documento . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , they should have pity on themselves , and the republic : for , from their own misfortunes , they had sufficient experience of what fortune can effect in war . <end>
<start> Interea et rei publicae et ipsis placere oportere , si uterque in contione statim iuravisset se triduo proximo exercitum dimissurum . <end>$$<start> Since , if fortune showed ever so little favor to either , he who thought himself superior , would not submit to terms of accommodation ; nor would be content with an equal division , when he might expect to obtain the whole . <end>
<start> Depositis armis auxiliisque , quibus nunc confiderent , necessario populi senatusque iudicio fore utrumque contentum . <end>$$<start> That as they could not agree before , the terms of peace ought to be submitted to the senate and people in Rome . <end>
<start> Vibullius eitus Corcyrae non minus necessarium esse existimavit de repentino adventu Caesaris Pompeium fieri certiorem , uti ad id consilium capere posset , antequam de mandatis agi inciperetur , atque ideo continuato nocte ac die itinere atque omnibus oppidis mutatis ad celeritatem iumentis ad Pompeium contendit , ut adesse Caesarem nuntiaret . <end>$$<start> Vibullius , having received this commission from Caesar , thought it no less necessary to give Pompey notice of Caesar's sudden approach , that he might adopt such plans as the circumstance required , than to inform him of Caesar's message ; and therefore continuing his journey by night as well as by day , and taking fresh horses for dispatch , he posted away to Pompey , to inform him that Caesar was marching toward him with all his forces . <end>
<start> Pompeius erat eo tempore in Candavia iterque ex Macedonia in hiberna Apolloniam Dyrrachiumque habebat Sed re nova perturbatus maioribus itineribus Apolloniam petere coepit , ne Caesar orae maritimae civitates occuparet . <end>$$<start> Pompey was at this time in Candavia , and was on his march from Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and Dyrrachium ; but surprised at the unexpected news , he determined to go to Apollonia by speedy marches , to prevent Caesar from becoming master of all the maritime states . <end>
<start> Quo cum venisset , Lucius Torquatus , qui iussu Pompei oppido praeerat praesidiumque ibi Parthinorum habebat , conatus portis clausis oppidum defendere , cum Graecos murum ascendere atque arma capere iuberet , illi autem se contra imperium populi Romani pugnaturos esse negarent , oppidani autem etiam sua sponte Caesarem recipere conarentur , desperatis omnibus auxiliis portas aperuit et se atque oppidum Caesari dedidit incolumisque ab eo conservatus est . <end>$$<start> But as they refused to fight against the power of the Roman people , and as the citizens made a spontaneous attempt to admit Caesar , despairing of any assistance , he threw open the gates , and surrendered himself and the town to Caesar , and was preserved safe from injury by him . <end>
<start> Recepto Caesar Orico nulla interposita mora Apolloniam proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> Having taken Oricum , Caesar marched without making any delay to Apollonia . <end>
<start> Cuius adventu audito Lucius Staberius , qui ibi praeerat , aquam comportare in arcem atque eam munire obsidesque ab Apolloniatibus exigere coepit . <end>$$<start> Staberius the governor , hearing of his approach , began to bring water into the citadel , and to fortify it , and to demand hostages of the town's people . <end>
<start> Illi vero daturos se negare , neque portas consuli praeclusuros , neque sibi iudicium sumpturos contra atque omnis Italia populusque Romanus indicavisset . <end>$$<start> But they refuse to give any , or to shut their gates against the consul , or to take upon them to judge contrary to what all Italy and the Roman people had judged . <end>
<start> Quorum cognita voluntate clam profugit Apollonia Staberius . <end>$$<start> As soon as he knew their inclinations , he made his escape privately . <end>
<start> Illi ad Caesarem legatos mittunt oppidoque recipiunt . <end>$$<start> The inhabitants of Apollonia sent embassadors to Caesar , and gave him admission into their town . <end>
<start> Hos sequnntur Bullidenses , Amantini et reliquae finitimae civitates totaque Epiros et legatis ad Caesarem missis , quae imperaret , facturos pollicentur . <end>$$<start> Their example was followed by the inhabitants of Bullis , Amantia , and the other neighboring states , and all Epirus : and they sent embassadors to Caesar , and promised to obey his commands . <end>
<start> At Pompeins cognitis his rebus , quae erant Orici atque Apolloniae gestae , Dyrrachio timens diurnis eo nocturnisque itineribus contendit . <end>$$<start> But Pompey having received information of the transactions at Oricum and Apollonia , began to be alarmed for Dyrrachium , and endeavored to reach it , marching day and night . <end>
<start> Simul Caesar appropinquare dicebatur , tantusque terror incidit eius exercitui , quod properans noctem diei coniunxerat neque iter intermiserat , ut paene omnes ex Epiro finitimisque regionibus signa relinquerent , complures arma proicerent ac fugae simile iter videretur . <end>$$<start> As soon as it was said that Caesar was approaching , such a panic fell upon Pompey's army , because in his haste he had made no distinction between night and day , and had marched without intermission , that they almost every man deserted their colors in Epirus and the neighboring countries ; several threw down their arms , and their march had the appearance of a flight . <end>
<start> Sed cum prope Dyrrachium Pompeius constitisset castraque metari iussisset , perterrito etiam tum exercitu princeps Labienus procedit iuratque se eum non deserturum eundemque casum subiturum , quemcumque ei fortuna tribuisset . <end>$$<start> But when Pompey had halted near Dyrrachium , and had given orders for measuring out the ground for his camp , his army even yet continuing in their fright , Labienus first stepped forward and swore that he would never desert him , and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to him . <end>
<start> Hoc idem reliqui iurant legati ; tribuni militum centurionesque sequuntur , atque idem omnis exercitus iurat . <end>$$<start> The other lieutenants took the same oath , and the tribunes and centurions followed their example : and the whole army swore in like manner . <end>
<start> Caesar praeoccupato itinere ad Dyrrachium finem properandi facit castraque ad flumen Apsum ponit in finibus Apolloniatium , ut bene meritae civitates tutae essent praesidio , ibique reliquarum ex Italia legionum adventum exspectare et sub pellibus hiemare constituit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , finding the road to Dyrrachium already in the possession of Pompey , was in no great haste , but encamped by the river Apsus , in the territory of Apollonia , that the states which had deserved his support might be certain of protection from his out-guards and forts ; and there he resolved to wait the arrival of his other legions from Italy , and to winter in tents . <end>
<start> Hoc idem Pompeius fecit et trans flumen Apsum positis castris eo copias omnes auxiliaque conduxit . <end>$$<start> Pompey did the same ; and pitching his camp on the other side of the river Apsus , collected there all his troops and auxiliaries . <end>
<start> Calenus legionibus equitibusque Brundisii in naves impositis , ut erat praeceptum a Caesare , quantum navium facultatem habebat , naves solvit paulumque a portu progressus litteras a Caesare accipit , quibus est certior factus portus litoraque omnia classibus adversariorum teneri . <end>$$<start> Kalenus , having put the legions and cavalry on board at Brundusium , as Caesar had directed him , as far as the number of his ships allowed , weighed anchor : and having sailed a little distance from port , received a letter from Caesar , in which he was informed , that all the ports and the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet : on receiving this information he returned into the harbor , and recalled all the vessels . <end>
<start> Quo cognito se in portum recipit navesque omnes revocat Una ex his , quae perseveravit neque imperio Caleni obtemperavit , quod erat sine militibus privatoque consilio administrabatur , delata Oricum atque a Bibulo expugnata est ; qui de servis liberisque omnibus ad impuberes supplicium sumit et ad unum interficit . <end>$$<start> One of them , which continued the voyage and did not obey Kalenus's command , because it carried no troops , but was private property , bore away for Oricum , and was taken by Bibulus , who spared neither slaves nor free men , nor even children ; but put all to the sword . <end>
<start> Ita exiguo tempore magnoque casu totius exercitus salus constitit . <end>$$<start> Thus the safety of the whole army depended on a very short space of time and a great casualty . <end>
<start> Bibulus , ut supra demonstratum est , erat cum classe ad Oricum et , sicuti mari portibusque Caesarem prohibebat , ita ipse omni terra earurn regionum prohibebatur ; praesidiis enim dispositis omnia litora a Caesare tenebantur , neque lignandi atque aquandi neque naves ad terram religandi potestas fiebat . <end>$$<start> Bibulus , as has been observed before , lay with his fleet near Oricum , and as he debarred Caesar of the liberty of the sea and harbors , so he was deprived of all intercourse with the country by land ; for the whole shore was occupied by parties disposed in different places by Caesar . <end>
<start> Sed cum essent in quibus demonstravi angustiis , ac se Libo cum Bibulo coniunxisset , loquuntur ambo ex navibus cum Marcus Acilio et Statio Murco legatis ; quorum alter oppidi muris , alter praesidiis terrestribus praeerat : velle se de maximis rebus cum Caesare loqui , si sibi eius rei facultas detur . <end>$$<start> He was reduced to great difficulties , and distressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary ; insomuch that he was obliged to bring , in transports from Corcyra , not only provisions , but even wood and water ; and it once happened that , meeting with violent storms , they were forced to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that covered their decks ; yet all these difficulties they bore patiently and without repining , and thought they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free from blockade . <end>
<start> Interim postulant ut sint indutiae , atque ab eis impetrant . <end>$$<start> They add something further to strengthen the impression that they intended to treat about an accommodation . <end>
<start> Magnum enim , quod afferebant , videbatur , et Caesarem id summe sciebant cupere , et profectum aliquid Vibullil mandatis existimabatur . <end>$$<start> In the mean time they requested a truce , and obtained it from them ; for what they proposed seemed to be of importance , and it was well known that Caesar desired it above all things , and it was imagined that some advantage would be derived from Bibulus's proposals . <end>
<start> Caesar eo tempore cum legione una profectus ad recipiendas ulteriores civitates et rem frumentariam expediendam , qua angusta utebatur , erat ad Buthrotum , oppidum oppositum Corcyrae . <end>$$<start> Caesar having set out with one legion to gain possession of the more remote states , and to provide corn , of which he had but a small quantity , was at this time at Buthrotum , opposite to Corcyra . <end>
<start> Ibi certior ab Acilio et Murco per litteras factus de postulatis Libonis et Bibuli legionem relinquit ; ipse Oricum revertitur . <end>$$<start> There receiving Acilius and Marcus's letters , informing him of Libo's and Bibulus's demands , he left his legion behind him , and returned himself to Oricum . <end>
<start> Eo cum venisset , evocantur illi ad colloquium . <end>$$<start> When he arrived , they were invited to a conference . <end>
<start> Prodit Libo atque excusat Bibulum , quod is iracundia summa erat inimicitiasque habebat etiam privatas cum Caesare ex aedilitate et praetura conceptas : ob eam causam colloquium vitasse , ne res maximae spei maximaeque utilitatis eius iracundia impedirentur . <end>$$<start> Libo came and made an apology for Bibulus , that he was a man of strong passion , and had a private quarrel against Caesar , contracted when he was aedile and praetor ; that for this reason he had avoided the conference , lest affairs of the utmost importance and advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper . <end>
<start> Suam summam esse ac fuisse semper voluntatem , ut componeretur atque ab armis discederetur , sed potestatem eius rei nullam habere , propterea quod de consilii sententia summam belli rerumque omnium Pompeio permiserint . <end>$$<start> That it now was and ever had been Pompey's most earnest wish , that they should be reconciled and lay down their arms , but they were not authorized to treat on that subject , because they resigned the whole management of the war , and all other matters to Pompey , by order of the council . <end>
<start> Sed postulatis Caesaris cognitis missuros ad Pompeium , atque illum reliqua per se acturum hortantibus ipsis . <end>$$<start> But when they were acquainted with Caesar's demands , they would transmit them to Pompey , who would conclude all of himself by their persuasions . <end>
<start> Interea manerent indutiae , dum ab illo rediri posset , neve alter alteri noceret . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , let the truce be continued till the messengers could return from him ; and let no injury be done on either side . <end>
<start> Huc addit pauca de causa et de copiis auxiliisque suis . <end>$$<start> To this he added a few words of the cause for which they fought , and of his own forces and resources . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus neque tum respondendum Caesar existimavit , neque nunc , ut memoriae prodantur , satis causae putamus . <end>$$<start> To this , Caesar did not then think proper to make any reply , nor do we now think it worth recording . <end>
<start> Postulabat Caesar , ut legatos sibi ad Pompeium sine periculo mittere liceret , idque ipsi fore reciperent aut acceptos per se ad eum perducerent . <end>$$<start> But Caesar required that he should be allowed to send commissioners to Pompey , who should suffer no personal injury ; and that either they should grant it , or should take his commissioners in charge , and convey them to Pompey . <end>
<start> Nihilo minus tamen agi posse de compositione , ut haec non remitterentur , neque hanc rem illi esse impedimento . <end>$$<start> They would neither receive Caesar's commissioners , nor guarantee their safety , but referred the whole to Pompey . <end>
<start> Quem ubi Caesar intellexit praesentis periculi atque inopiae vitandae causa omnem orationem instituisse neque ullam spem aut condicionem pacis afferre , ad reliquam cogitationem belli sese recepit . <end>$$<start> But when Caesar perceived that they had proposed the conference merely to avoid present danger and distress , but that they offered no hopes or terms of peace , he applied his thoughts to the prosecution of the war . <end>
<start> Bibulus multos dies terra prohibitus et graviore morbo ex frigore et labore implicitus , cum neque curari posset neque susceptum officium deserere vellet , vim morbi sustinere non potuit Eo mortuo ad neminem unum summa imperii redit , sed separatim suam quisque classem ad arbitrium suum administrabat . <end>$$<start> Bibulus , being prevented from landing for several days , and being seized with a violent distemper from the cold and fatigue , as he could neither be cured on board , nor was willing to desert the charge which he had taken upon him , was unable to bear up against the violence of the disease . <end>
<start> Vibullius sedato tumultu , quem repentinus adventus Caesaris concitaverat , ubi primum e re visum est , adhibito Libone et Lucius Lucceio et Theophane , quibuscum communicare de maximis rebus Pompeius consueverat , de mandatis Caesaris agere instituit . <end>$$<start> On his death , the sole command devolved on no single individual , but each admiral managed his own division separately , and at his own discretion . <end>
<start> Quid mihi , inquit , aut vita aut civitate opus est , quam beneficio Caesaris habere videbor ? cuius rei opinio tolli non poterit , cum in Italiam , ex qua profectus sum , reductus existimabor bello periecto . <end>$$<start> After the conclusion of the war , Caesar was informed of these expressions by some persons who were present at the conversation . <end>
<start> Ab eis Caesar haec facta cognovit , qui sermoni interfuerunt ; conatus tamen nihilo minus est allis rationibus per colloquia de pace agere . <end>$$<start> He attempted , however , by other means to bring about a negotiation of peace . <end>
<start> Inter bina castra Pompei atque Caesaris unum flumen tantum intererat Apsus , crebraque inter se colloquia milites habebant , neque ullum interim telum per pactiones loquentium traiciebatur . <end>$$<start> Between Pompey's and Caesar's camp there was only the river Apsus , and the soldiers frequently conversed with each other ; and by a private arrangement among themselves , no weapons were thrown during their conferences . <end>
<start> Mittit Publius Vatinium legatum ad ripam ipsam fluminis , qui ea , quae maxime ad pacem pertinere viderentur , ageret et crebro magna voce pronuntiaret , liceretne civibus ad cives de pace legatos mittere , quod etiam fugitivis ab saltu Pyrenaeo praedonibusque licuisset , praesertim eum id agerent , ne cives cum civibus armis decertarent ? Multa suppliciter locutus est , ut de sua atque omnium salute debebat , silentioque ab utrisque militibus auditus . <end>$$<start> Caesar sent Publius Vatinius , one of his lieutenants , to the bank of the river , to make such proposals as should appear most conducive to peace ; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice asking , Are citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat of peace ? a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the Pyrenean mountains , and to robbers , especially when by so doing they would prevent citizens from fighting against citizens . <end>
<start> Quo cum esset postero die ventum , magna utrimque multitudo convenit , magnaque erat exspectatio eius rei , atque omnium animi intenti esse ad pacem videbantur . <end>$$<start> When the deputies met the next day , a great multitude from both sides assembled , and the expectations of every person concerning this subject were raised very high , and their minds seemed to be eagerly disposed for peace . <end>
<start> Qua ex frequentia , Titus Labienus prodit , sed missa oratione de pace , loqui atque altercari cum Vatinio incipit . <end>$$<start> Titus Labienus walked forward from the crowd , and in submissive terms began to speak of peace , and to argue with Vatinius . <end>
<start> Quorum mediam orationem interrumpunt subito undique tela immissa ; quae ille obtectus armis militum vitavit ; vulnerantur tamen complures , in his Cornelius Balbus , Marcus Plotius , Lucius Tiburtius , centuriones militesque nonnulli . <end>$$<start> But their conversation was suddenly interrupted by darts thrown from all sides , from which Vatinius escaped by being protected by the arms of the soldiers . <end>
<start> Eisdem temporibus Marcus Caelius Rufus praetor causa debitorum suscepta initio magistratus tribunal suum iuxta Gaius Treboni , praetoris urbani , sellam collocavit et , si quis appellavisset de aestimatione et de solutionibus , quae per arbitrum fierent , ut Caesar praesens constituerat , fore auxilio pollicebatur . <end>$$<start> At the same time in Rome , Marcus Caelius Rufus , one of the praetors , having undertaken the cause of the debtors , on entering into his office , fixed his tribunal near the bench of Caius Trebonius , the city praetor , and promised if any person appealed to him in regard to the valuation and payment of debts made by arbitration , as appointed by Caesar when in Rome , that he would relieve them . <end>
<start> Sed fiebat aequitate decreti et humanitate Treboni , qui his temporibus clementer et moderate ius dicendum existimabat , ut reperiri non possent , a quibus initium appellandi nasceretur . <end>$$<start> But it happened , from the justice of Trebonius's decrees and his humanity (for he thought that in such dangerous times justice should be administered with moderation and compassion) , that not one could be found who would offer himself the first to lodge an appeal . <end>
<start> Nam fortasse inopiam excusare et calamitatem aut propriam suam aut temporum queri et difficultates auctionandi proponere etiam mediocris est animi ; integras vero tenere possessiones , qui se debere fateantur , cuius animi aut cuius impudentiae est ? Itaque , hoc qui postularet reperiebatur nemo . <end>$$<start> For to plead poverty , to complain of his own private calamities , or the general distresses of the times , or to assert the difficulty of setting the goods to sale , is the behavior of a man even of a moderate temper ; but to retain their possessions entire , and at the same time acknowledge themselves in debt , what sort of spirit , and what impudence would it not have argued! Therefore nobody was found so unreasonable as to make such demands . <end>
<start> Atque ipsis , ad quorum commodum pertinebat , durior inventus est Caelius Et ab hoc profectus initio , ne frustra ingressus turpem causam videretur , legem promulgavit , ut sexenni die sine usuris creditae pecuniae solvantur . <end>$$<start> But Caelius proved more severe to those very persons for whose advantage it had been designed ; and starting from this beginning , in order that he might not appear to have engaged in so dishonorable an affair without effecting something , he promulgated a law that all debts should be discharged in six equal payments , of six months each , without interest . <end>
<start> Cum resisteret Servilius consul reliquique magistratus , et minus opinione sua efficeret , ad hominum excitanda studia sublata priore lege duas promulgavit : unam , qua mercedes habitationum annuas conductoribus donavit , aliam tabularum novarum , impetuque multitudinis in Gaius Trebonium facto et nonnullis vulneratis eum de tribunali deturbavit . <end>$$<start> When Servilius , the consul , and the other magistrates opposed him , and he himself effected less than he expected , in order to raise the passions of the people , he dropped it , and promulgated two others ; one , by which he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the tenants , the other , an act of insolvency : upon which the mob made an assault on Caius Trebonius , and having wounded several persons , drove him from his tribunal . <end>
<start> De quibus rebus Servilius consul ad senatum rettulit , senatusque Caelium ab re publica removendum censuit . <end>$$<start> The consul Servilius informed the senate of his proceedings , who passed a decree that Caelius should be removed from the management of the republic . <end>
<start> Hoc decreto eum consul senatu prohibuit et contionari conantem de rostris deduxit . <end>$$<start> Upon this decree , the consul forbade him the senate ; and when he was attempting to harangue the people , turned him out of the rostrum . <end>
<start> Ille ignominia et dolore permotus palam se proficisci ad Caesarem simulavit ; clam nuntiis ad Milonem missis , qui Clodio interfecto eo nomine erat damnatus , atque eo in Italiam evocato , quod magnis muneribus datis gladiatoriac familiae reliquias habebat , sibi coniiunxit atque eum in Thurinum ad sollicitandos pastores praemisit . <end>$$<start> Stung with the ignominy and with resentment , he pretended in public that he would go to Caesar , but privately sent messengers to Milo , who had murdered Clodius , and had been condemned for it ; and having invited him into Italy , because he had engaged the remains of the gladiators to his interest , by making them ample presents , he joined him , and sent him to Thurinum to tamper with the shepherds . <end>
<start> Ipse cum Casilinum venisset , uno que tempore signa eius militaria atque arma Capuae essent comprensa et familia Neapoli visa , quae proditionem oppidi appararet , patefactis consiliis exclusus Capua et periculum veritus , quod conventus arma ceperat atque eum hostis loco habendum existimabat , consilio destitit atque eo itinere sese avertit . <end>$$<start> When he himself was on his road to Casilinum , at the same time that his military standards and arms were seized at Capua , his slaves seen at Naples , and the design of betraying the town discovered : his plots being revealed , and Capua shut against him , being apprehensive of danger , because the Roman citizens residing there had armed themselves , and thought he ought to be treated as an enemy to the state , he abandoned his first design , and changed his route . <end>
<start> Interim Milo dimissis circum municipia litteris , se ea , quae faceret , iussu atque imperio facere Pompei , quae mandata ad se per Vibullium delata essent , quos ex acre alieno laborare arbitrabatur , sollicitabat . <end>$$<start> Milo in the mean time dispatched letters to the free towns , purporting that he acted as he did by the orders and commands of Pompey , conveyed to him by Bibulus : and he endeavored to engage in his interest all persons whom he imagined were under difficulties by reason of their debts . <end>
<start> Apud quos cum proficere nihil posset , quibusdam solutis ergastulis Cosam in agro Thurino oppugnare coepit . <end>$$<start> But not being able to prevail with them , he set at liberty some slaves from the work-houses , and began to assault Cosa in the district of Thurinum . <end>
<start> Eo cum a Quintus Pedio praetore cum legione lapide ictus ex muro periit Et Caelius profectus , ut dictitabat , ad Caesarem pervenit Thurios Ubi cum quosdam eius municipii sollicitaret equitibusque Caesaris Gallis atque Hispanis , qui eo praesidii causa missi erant , pecuniam polliceretur , ab his est interfectus . <end>$$<start> There having received a blow of a stone thrown from the wall of the town which was commanded by Quintus Pedius with one legion , he died of it ; and Caelius having set out , as he pretended for Caesar , went to Thurii , where he was put to death as he was tampering with some of the freemen of the town , and was offering money to Caesar's Gallic and Spanish horse , which he had sent there to strengthen the garrison . <end>
<start> Ita magnarum initia rerum , quae occupatione magistratuum et temporum sollicitam Italiam habebant , celerem et facilem exitum habuerunt . <end>$$<start> And thus these mighty beginnings , which had embroiled Italy , and kept the magistrates employed , found a speedy and happy issue . <end>
<start> Libo profectus ab Orico cum classe , cui praeerat , navium L , Brundisium venit insulamque , quae contra portum Brundisinum est , occupavit , quod praestare arbitrabatur unum locum , qua necessarius nostris erat egressus , quam omnia litora ac portus custodia clausos teneri . <end>$$<start> Libo having sailed from Oricum , with a fleet of fifty ships , which he commanded , came to Brundusium , and seized an island , which lies opposite to the harbor ; judging it better to guard that place , which was our only pass to sea , than to keep all the shores and ports blocked up by a fleet . <end>
<start> Hic repentino adventu naves onerarias quasdam nactus incendit et unam frumento onustam abduxit magnumque nostris terrorem iniecit et noctu militibus ac sagittariis in terram eitis praesidium equitum deiecit et adeo loci opportunitate profecit , uti ad Pompeium litteras mitteret , naves reliquas , si vellet , subduci et refici iubcret : sua classe auxilia sese Caesaris prohibiturum . <end>$$<start> By his sudden arrival , he fell in with some of our transports , and set them on fire , and carried off one laden with corn ; he struck great terror into our men , and having in the night landed a party of soldiers and archers , he beat our guard of horse from their station , and gained so much by the advantage of situation , that he dispatched letters to Pompey , and if he pleased he might order the rest of the ships to be hauled upon shore and repaired ; for that with his own fleet he could prevent Caesar from receiving his auxiliaries . <end>
<start> Erat eo tempore Antonius Brundisii ; is virtute militum confisus scaphas navium magnarum circiter LX cratibus pluteisque contexit eoque milites delectos imposuit atque eas in litore pluribus locis separatim disposuit navesque triremes duas , quas Brundisii faciendas curaverat , per causam exercendorum remigum ad fauces portus prodire iussit . <end>$$<start> Antonius was at this time at Brundusium , and relying on the valor of his troops , covered about sixty of the long-boats belonging to the men-of-war with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles , and put on board them select soldiers ; and disposed them separately along the shore : and under the pretext of keeping the seamen in exercise , he ordered two three-banked galleys , which he had built at Brundusium , to row to the mouth of the port . <end>
<start> Has cum audacius progressas Libo vidisset , sperans intercipi posse , quadriremes V ad eas misit . <end>$$<start> When Libo saw them advancing boldly toward him , he sent five four-banked galleys against them , in hopes of intercepting them . <end>
<start> Quae cum navibus nostris appropinquassent , nostri veterani in portum refugiebant : illi studio incitati incautius sequebantur . <end>$$<start> When these came near our ships , our veteran soldiers retreated within the harbor . <end>
<start> Iam ex omnibus partibus subito Antonianae scaphae signo dato se in hostes incitaverunt primoque impeto unam ex his quadriremibus cum remigibus defensoribusque suis ceperunt , reliquas turpiter refugere coegerunt . <end>$$<start> The enemy , urged by their eagerness to capture them , pursued them unguardedly : for instantly the boats of Antonius , on a certain signal , rowed with great violence from all parts against the enemy ; and at the first charge took one of the four-banked galleys , with the seamen and marines , and forced the rest to flee disgracefully . <end>
<start> Ad hoc detrimentum accessit , ut equitibus per oram maritimam ab Antonio dispositis aquari prohiberentur . <end>$$<start> In addition to this loss , they were prevented from getting water by the horse which Antonius had disposed along the sea-coast . <end>
<start> Qua necessitate et ignominia permotus Libo discessit a Brundisio obsessionemque nostrorum omisit . <end>$$<start> Libo , vexed at the distress and disgrace , departed from Brundusium , and abandoned the blockade . <end>
<start> Multi iam menses erant et hiems praecipitaverat , neque Brundisio naves legionesque ad Caesarem veniebant Ac nonnullae eius rei praetermissae occasiones Caesari videbantur , quod certi saepe flaverant venti , quibus necessario committendum existimabat . <end>$$<start> Several months had now elapsed , and winter was almost gone , and Caesar's legions and shipping were not coming to him from Brundusium , and he imagined that some opportunities had been neglected , for the winds had at least been often favorable , and he thought that he must trust to them at last . <end>
<start> Quantoque eius amplius processerat temporis , tanto erant alacriores ad custodias , qui classibus praeerant , maioremque fiduciam prohibendi habebant , et crebris Pompei litteris castigabantur , quoniam primo venientem Caesarem non prohibuissent , ut reliquos eius exercitus impedirent , duriusque cotidie tempus ad transportandum lenioribus ventis exspectabant . <end>$$<start> And the longer it was deferred , the more eager were those who commanded Pompey's fleet to guard the coast , and were more confident of preventing our getting assistance : they received frequent reproofs from Pompey by letter , that as they had not prevented Caesar's arrival at the first , they should at least stop the remainder of his army : and they were expecting that the season for transporting troops , would become more unfavorable every day , as the winds grew calmer . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus permotus Caesar Brundisium ad suos severius scripsit , nacti idoneum ventum ne occasionem navigandi dimitterent , sive ad litora Apolloniatium sive ad Labeatium cursum dirigere atque eo naves eicere possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar , feeling some trouble on this account , wrote in severe terms to his officers at Brundusium , and gave them orders that as soon as they found the wind to answer , they should not let the opportunity of setting sail pass by , if they were even to steer their course to the shore of Apollonia : because there they might run their ships on ground . <end>
<start> Haec a custodiis classium loca maxime vacabant , quod se longius a portibus committere non audebant . <end>$$<start> That these parts principally were left unguarded by the enemy's fleet , because they dare not venture too far from the harbor . <end>
<start> Illi adhibita audacia et virtute administrantibus Marcus Antonio et Fufio Caleno , multum ipsis militibus hortantibus neque ullum periculum pro salute Caesaris recusantibus nacti austrum naves solvunt atque altero die Apolloniam praetervehuntur Qui cum essent ex continenti visi , Coponius , qui Dyrrachii classi Rhodiae praeerat , naves ex portu educit , et cum iam nostris remissiore vento appropinquasset , idem auster increbuit nostrisque praesidio fuit . <end>$$<start> They his officers , exerting boldness and courage , aided by the instructions of Marcus Antonius , and Fusius Kalenus , and animated by the soldiers strongly encouraging them , and declining no danger for Caesar's safety , having got a southerly wind , weighed anchor , and the next day were carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium , and being seen from the continent , Quintus Coponius , who commanded the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium , put out of the port with his ships ; and when they had almost come up with us , in consequence of the breeze dying away , the south wind sprang up afresh , and rescued us . <end>
<start> Neque vero ille ob eam causam conatu desistebat , sed labore et perseverantia nautarum etiam vim tempestatis superari posse sperabat praetervectosque Dyrrachium magna vi venti nihilo secius sequebatur . <end>$$<start> However , he did not desist from his attempt , but hoped by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able to bear up against the violence of the storm ; and although we were carried beyond Dyrrachium , by the violence of the wind , he nevertheless continued to chase us . <end>
<start> Nostri usi fortunae beneficio tamen impetum classis timebant , si forte ventus remisisset Nacti portum , qui appellatur Nymphaeum , ultra Lissum milia passuum III , eo naves introduxerunt (qui portus ab Africo tegebatur , ab austro non erat tutus) leviusque tempestatis quam classis periculum aestimaverunt . <end>$$<start> Our men , taking advantage of fortune's kindness , for they were still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet , if the wind abated , having come near a port , called Nymphaeum , about three miles beyond Lissus , put into it (this port is protected from a south-west wind , but is not secure against a south wind) ; and thought less danger was to be apprehended from the storm than from the enemy . <end>
<start> Quo simulatque introitum est , incredibili felicitate auster , qui per biduum flaverat , in Africum se vertit . <end>$$<start> But as soon as they were within the port , the south wind , which had blown for two days , by extraordinary good luck veered round to the south-west . <end>
<start> Hic subitam commutationem fortunae videre licuit . <end>$$<start> Here one might observe the sudden turns of fortune . <end>
<start> Qui modo sibi timuerant , hos tutissimus portus recipiebat ; qui nostris navibus periculum intulerant , de suo timere cogebantur Itaque tempore commutato tempestas et nostros texit et naves Rhodias afflixit , ita ut ad unam omnes , constratae numero XVI , eliderentur et naufragio interirent , et ex magno remigum propugnatorumque numero pars ad scopulos allisa interficeretur , pars ab nostris detraheretur ; quos omnes conservatos Caesar domum dimisit . <end>$$<start> We who , a moment before , were alarmed for ourselves , were safely lodged in a very secure harbor : and they who had threatened ruin to our fleet , were forced to be uneasy on their own account : and thus , by a change of circumstances , the storm protected our ships , and damaged the Rhodian fleet to such a degree that all their decked ships , sixteen in number , foundered , without exception , and were wrecked : and of the prodigious number of seamen and soldiers , some lost their lives by being dashed against the rocks , others were taken by our men : but Caesar sent them all safe home . <end>
<start> Nostrae naves duae tardius cursu confecto in noctem coniectae , cum ignorarent , quem locum reliquae cepissent , contra Lissum in ancoris constiterunt . <end>$$<start> Two of our ships , that had not kept up with the rest , being overtaken by the night , and not knowing what port the rest had made to , came to an anchor opposite Lissus . <end>
<start> Has scaphis minoribusque navigiis compluribus immissis Otacilius Crassus , qui Lissi praeerat , expugnare parabat ; simul de deditione eorum agebat et incolumitatem deditis pollicebatur . <end>$$<start> Otacilius Crassus , who commanded Pompey's fleet , detached after them several barges and small craft , and attempted to take them . <end>
<start> Harum altera navis CCXX e legione tironum sustulerat , altera ex veterana paulo minus CC . <end>$$<start> At the same time , he treated with them about capitulating , and promised them their lives if they would surrender . <end>
<start> Hic cognosci licuit , quantum esset hominibus praesidii in animi firmitudine . <end>$$<start> One of them carried two hundred and twenty recruits , the other was manned with somewhat less than two hundred veterans . <end>
<start> Tirones enim multitudine navium perterriti et salo nauseaque confecti iureiurando accepto , nihil eis nocituros hostes , se Otacilio dediderunt ; qui omnes ad eum producti contra religionem iurisiurandi in eius conspectu crudelissime interficiuntur . <end>$$<start> Here it might be seen what security men derive from a resolute spirit For the recruits , frightened at the number of vessels , and fatigued with the rolling of the sea , and with sea-sickness , surrendered to Otacilius , after having first received his oath , that the enemy would not injure them ; but as soon as they were brought before him , contrary to the obligation of his oath , they were inhumanly put to death in his presence . <end>
<start> At veteranae legionis milites , item conflictati et tempestatis et sentinae vitiis , neque ex pristina virtute remittendum aliquid putaverunt , et tractandis condicionibus et simulatione deditionis extracto primo noctis tempore gubernatorem in terram navem eicere cogunt , ipsi idoneum locum nacti reliquam noctis partem ibi confecerunt et luce prima missis ad eos ab Otacilio equitibus , qui eam partem orae maritimae asservabant , circiter CCCC , quique eos armati ex praesidio secuti sunt , se defenderunt et nonnullis eorum interfectis incolumes se ad nostros receperunt . <end>$$<start> But the soldiers of the veteran legion , who had also struggled , not only with the inclemency of the weather , but by laboring at the pump , thought it their duty to remit nothing of their former valor : and having protracted the beginning of the night in settling the terms , under pretense of surrendering , they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground : and having got a convenient place on the shore , they spent the rest of the night there , and at day-break , when Otacilius had sent against them a party of the horse , who guarded that part of the coast , to the number of four hundred , beside some armed men , who had followed them from the garrison , they made a brave defense , and having killed some of them , retreated in safety to our army . <end>
<start> Quo facto conventus civium Romanorum , qui Lissum obtinebant , quod oppidum eis antea Caesar attribuerat muniendumque curaverat , Antonium recepit omnibusque rebus iuvit . <end>$$<start> After this action , the Roman citizens , who resided at Lissus , a town which Caesar had before assigned them , and had carefully fortified , received Antony into their town , and gave him every assistance . <end>
<start> Otacilius sibi timens ex oppido fugit et ad Pompeium pervenit . <end>$$<start> Otacilius , apprehensive for his own safety , escaped out of the town , and went to Pompey . <end>
<start> Eitis omnibus copiis Antonius , quarum erat summa veteranarum trium legionum uniusque tironum et equitum DCCC , plerasque naves in Italiam remittit ad reliquos milites equitesque transportandos , pontones , quod est genus navium Gallicarum , Lissi relinquit , hoc consilio , ut si forte Pompeius vacuam existimans Italiam eo traiecisset exercitum , quae opinio erat edita in vulgus , aliquam Caesar ad insequendum facultatem haberet , nuntiosque ad eum celeriter mittit , quibus regionibus exercitum euisset et quid militum transvexisset . <end>$$<start> All his forces , whose number amounted to three veteran legions , and one of recruits , and about eight hundred horse being landed , Antony sent most of his ships back to Italy , to transport the remainder of the soldiers and horse The pontons , which are a sort of Gallic ships , he left at Lissus with this object , that if Pompey , imagining Italy defenseless , should transport his army thither (and this notion was spread among the common people) , Caesar might have some means of pursuing him ; and he sent messengers to him with great dispatch , to inform him in what part of the country he had landed his army , and what number of troops he had brought over with him . <end>
<start> Cognitaque re diversa sibi ambo consilia capiunt : Caesar , ut quam primum se cum Antonio coniungeret ; Pompeius , ut venientibus in itinere se opponeret , si imprudentes ex insidiis , adoriri posset , eodemque die uterque eorum ex castris stativis a flumine Apso exercitum educunt : Pompeius clam et noctu , Caesar palam atque interdiu . <end>$$<start> Pompey's route being easy , because he was not obliged to cross the river , he advanced rapidly and by forced marches against Antonius , and being informed of his approach , chose a convenient situation , where he posted his forces ; and kept his men close within camp , and forbade fires to be kindled , that his arrival might be the more secret . <end>
<start> Haec ad Antonium statim per Graecos deferuntur . <end>$$<start> He dispatched messengers to Caesar , and confined himself in his camp for one day . <end>
<start> Cuius adventu cognito Pompeius , ne duobus circumcluderetur exercitibus , ex eo loco discedit omnibusque copiis ad Asparagium Dyrrachinorum pervenit atque ibi idoneo loco castra ponit . <end>$$<start> On learning his arrival , Pompey , to prevent his being hemmed in between two armies , quitted his position , and went with all his forces to Asparagium , in the territory of Dyrrachium , and there encamped in a convenient situation . <end>
<start> His temporibus Scipio detrimentis quibusdam circa montem Amanum acceptis imperatorem se appellaverat Quo facto civitatibus tyrannisque magnas imperaverat pecunias , item a publicanis suae provinciae debitam biennii pecuniam exegerat et ab eisdem insequentis anni mutuam praeceperat equitesque toti provinciae imperaverat . <end>$$<start> During these times , Scipio , though he had sustained some losses near mount Amanus , had assumed to himself the title of imperator , after which he demanded large sums of money from the states and princes . <end>
<start> Quibus coactis , finitimis hostibus Parthis post se relictis , qui paulo ante Marcus Crassum imperatorem interfecerant et Marcus Bibulum in obsidione habuerant , legiones equitesque ex Syria deduxerat . <end>$$<start> He had also exacted from the tax-gatherers , two years' rents that they owed ; and enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year , and demanded a supply of horse from the whole province . <end>
<start> Summamque in sollicitudinem ac timorem Parthici belli provincia cum venisset , ac nonnullae militum voces cum audirentur , sese , contra hostem si ducerentur , ituros , contra civem et consulem arma non laturos , deductis Pergamum atque in locupletissimas urbes in hiberna legionibus maximas largitiones fecit et confirmandorum militum causa diripiendas his civitates dedit . <end>$$<start> When they were collected , leaving behind him his neighboring enemies , the Parthians (who shortly before had killed Marcus Crassus , the imperator , and had kept Marcus Bibulus besieged) , he drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria ; and when he came into the province , which was under great anxiety and fear of the Parthian war , and heard some declarations of the soldiers , That they would march against an enemy , if he would lead them on ; but would never bear arms against a countryman and consul ; he drew off his legions to winter quarters to Pergamus , and the most wealthy cities , and made them rich presents : and in order to attach them more firmly to his interest , permitted them to plunder the cities . <end>
<start> Interim acerbissime imperatae pecuniae tota provincia exigebantur . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , the money which had been demanded from the province at large , was most vigorously exacted . <end>
<start> Multa praeterea generatim ad avaritiam excogitabantur . <end>$$<start> Besides , many new imposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice . <end>
<start> In capita singula servorum ac liberorum tributum imponebatur ; columnaria , ostiaria , frumentum , milites , arma , remiges , tormenta , vecturae imperabantur ; cuius modo rei nomen reperiri poterat , hoc satis esse ad cogendas pecunias videbatur . <end>$$<start> A tax of so much a head was laid on every slave and child Columns , doors , corn , soldiers , sailors , arms , engines , and carriages , were made subject to a duty . <end>
<start> Non solum urbibus , sed paene vicis castellisque singulis cum imperio praeficiebantur . <end>$$<start> Wherever a name could be found for any thing , it was deemed a sufficient reason for levying money on it . <end>
<start> Erat plena lictorum et imperiorum provincia , differta praefectis atque exactoribus : qui praeter imperatas pecunias suo etiam privato compendio serviebant ; dictitabant enim se domo patriaque expulsos omnibus necessariis egere rebus , ut honesta praescriptione rem turpissimam tegerent . <end>$$<start> To this was added the most exorbitant interest , as usually happens in times of war ; the whole sums being called in , on which occasion , they alleged that the delay of a single day was a donation . <end>
<start> Accedebant ad haec gravissimae usurae , quod in bello plerumque accidere consuevit universis imperatis pecuniis ; quibus in rebus prolationem diei donationem esse dicebant . <end>$$<start> Therefore , in those two years , the debt of the province was doubled : but notwithstanding , taxes were exacted , not only from the Roman citizens , but from every corporation and every state . <end>
<start> Itaque aes alienum provinciae eo biennio multiplicatum est . <end>$$<start> And they said that these were loans , exacted by the senate's decree . <end>
<start> Praeterea Ephesi a fano Dianae depositas antiquitus pecunias Scipio tolli iubebat . <end>$$<start> Moreover , Scipio ordered the money formerly lodged in the temple of Diana at Ephesus , to be taken out with the statues of that goddess , which remained there . <end>
<start> Certaque eius rei die constituta cum in fanum ventum esset adhibitis compluribus ordinis senatorii , quos advocaverat Scipio , litterae ei redduntur a Pompeio , mare transisse cum legionibus Caesarem : properaret ad se cum exercitu venire omniaque posthaberet . <end>$$<start> When Scipio came to the temple , letters were delivered to him from Pompey , in the presence of several senators , whom he had called upon to attend him ; informing him that Caesar had crossed the sea with his legions ; that Scipio should hasten to him with his army , and postpone all other business . <end>
<start> His litteris acceptis quos advocaverat dimittit ; ipse iter in Macedoniam parare incipit paucisque post diebus est profectus . <end>$$<start> As soon as he received the letter , he dismissed his attendants , and began to prepare for his journey to Macedonia ; and a few days after set out . <end>
<start> Haec res Ephesiae pecuniae salutem attulit . <end>$$<start> This circumstance saved the money at Ephesus . <end>
<start> Caesar Antonii exercitu coniuncto deducta Orico legione , quam tuendae orae maritimae causa posuerat , temptandas sibi provincias longiusque procedendum existimabat et , cum ad eum ex Thessalia Aetoliaque legati venissent , qui praesidio misso pollicerentur earum gentium civitates imperata facturas , Lucius Cassium Longinum cum legione tironum , quae appellabatur XXVII , atque equitibus CC in Thessaliam , Gaius Calvisium Sabinum cum cohortibus V paucisque equitibus in Aetoliam misit ; maxime eos , quod erant propinquae regiones , de re frumentaria ut providerent , hortatus est . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having effected a junction with Antonius's army , and having drawn his legion out of Oricum , which he had left there to guard the coast , thought he ought to sound the inclination of the provinces , and march further into the country ; and when embassadors came to him from Thessaly and Aetolia , to engage that the states in those countries would obey his orders , if he sent a garrison to protect them , he dispatched Lucius Cassius Longinus , with the twenty-seventh , a legion composed of young soldiers , and two hundred horse , to Thessaly : and Caius Calvisius Sabinus , with five cohorts , and a small party of horse , into Aetolia . <end>
<start> Gnaeus Domitium Calvinum cum legionibus duabus , XI et XII , et equitibus D in Macedoniam proficisci iussit ; cuius provinciae ab ea parte , quae libera appellabatur , Menedemus , princeps earum regionum , missus legatus omnium suorum excellens studium profitebatur . <end>$$<start> He recommended them to be especially careful to provide corn , because those regions were nearest to him He ordered Cneius Domitius Calvinus to march into Macedonia with two legions , the eleventh and twelfth , and five hundred horse ; from which province , Menedemus , the principal man of those regions , on that side which is called the Free , having come as embassador , assured him of the most devoted affection of all his subjects . <end>
<start> Ex his Calvisius primo adventu summa omnium Aetolorum receptus voluntate , praesidiis adversariorum Calydone et Naupacto eiectis , omni Aetolia potitus est . <end>$$<start> Of these Calvisius , on his first arrival in Aetolia , being very kindly received , dislodged the enemy's garrisons in Calydon and Naupactus , and made himself master of the whole country . <end>
<start> Eodemque tempore Domitius in Macedoniam venit ; et cum ad eum frequentes civitatum legationes convenire coepissent , nuntiatum est adesse Scipionem cum legionibus , magna opinione et fama omnium ; nam plerumque in novitate rem fama antecedit . <end>$$<start> At the same time , Domitius arrived in Macedonia : and when numerous embassies had begun to wait on him from many of the states , news was brought that Scipio was approaching with his legions , which occasioned various opinions and reports ; for in strange events , rumor generally goes before . <end>
<start> Hic nullo in loco Macedoniae moratus magno impetu tetendit ad Domitium et , cum ab eo milia passuum XX afuisset , subito se ad Cassium Longinum in Thessalasm convertit . <end>$$<start> Without making any delay in any part of Macedonia , he marched with great haste against Domitius ; and when he was come within about twenty miles of him , wheeled on a sudden toward Cassius Longinus in Thessaly . <end>
<start> Hoc adeo celeriter fecit , ut simul adesse et venire nuntiaretur , et quo iter expeditius faceret , Marcus Favonium ad flumen Aliacmonem , quod Macedoniam a Thessalia dividit , cum cohortibus VIII praesidio impedimentis legionum reliquit castellumque ibi muniri iussit . <end>$$<start> He effected this with such celerity , that news of his march and arrival came together ; for to render his march expeditious , he left the baggage of his legions behind him at the river Haliacmon , which divides Macedonia from Thessaly , under the care of Marcus Favonius , with a guard of eight cohorts , and ordered him to build a strong fort there . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore equitatus regis Cotyis ad castra Cassii advolavit , qui circum Thessaliam esse consuerat Tum timore perterritus Cassius cognito Scipionis adventu visisque equitibus , quos Scipionis esse arbitrabatur , ad montes se convertit , qui Thessaliam cingunt , atque ex his locis Ambraciam versus iter facere coepit . <end>$$<start> At the same time , Cotus's cavalry , which used to infest the neighborhood of Macedonia , flew to attack Cassius's camp , at which Cassius being alarmed , and having received information of Scipio's approach , and seen the horse , which he imagined to be Scipio's , he betook himself to the mountains that environ Thessaly , and thence began to make his route toward Ambracia . <end>
<start> At Scipionem properantem sequi litterae sunt consecutae a Marcus Favonio , Domitium cum legionibus adesse neque se praesidium , ubi constitutus esset , sine auxilio Scipionis tenere posse . <end>$$<start> But when Scipio was hastening to pursue him , dispatches overtook him from Favonius , that Domitius was marching against him with his legions , and that he could not maintain the garrison over which he was appointed , without Scipio's assistance . <end>
<start> Quibus litteris acceptis consilium Scipio iterque commutat ; Cassium sequi desistit , Favonio auxilium ferre contendit . <end>$$<start> On receipt of these dispatches , Scipio changed his designs and his route , desisted from his pursuit of Cassius , and hastened to relieve Favonius . <end>
<start> Itaque die ac nocte continuato itinere ad eum pervenit , tam opportuno tempore , ut simul Domitiani exercitus pulvis cerneretur , et primi antecursores Scipionis viderentur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , continuing his march day and night , he came to him so opportunely , that the dust raised by Domitius's army , and Scipio's advanced guard , were observed at the same instant . <end>
<start> Ita Cassio industria Domitii , Favonio Scipionis celeritas salutem attulit . <end>$$<start> Thus , the vigilance of Domitius saved Cassius , and the expedition of Scipio , Favonius . <end>
<start> Scipio biduum castris stativis moratus ad flumen , quod inter eum et Domitii castra fluebat , Aliacmonem , tertio die prima luce exercitum vado traducit et castris positis postero die mane copias ante frontem castrorum instruit . <end>$$<start> Scipio , having staid for two days in his camp , along the river Haliacmon , which ran between him and Domitius's camp , on the third day , at dawn , led his army across a ford , and having made a regular encampment the day following , drew up his forces in front of his camp . <end>
<start> Domitius tum quoque sibi dubitandum non putavit , quin productis legionibus proelio decertaret . <end>$$<start> Domitius thought he ought not to show any reluctance , but should draw out his forces and hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Sed cum esset inter bina castra campus circiter milium passuum II , Domitius castris Scipionis aciem suam subiecit ; ille a vallo non discedere perseveravit . <end>$$<start> But as there was a plain six miles in breadth between the two camps , he posted his army before Scipio's camp ; while the latter persevered in not quitting his intrenchment . <end>
<start> Ac tamen aegre retentis Domitianis militibus est factum , ne proelio contenderetur , et maxime , quod rivus difficilibus ripis subiectus castris Scipionis progressus nostrorum impediebat . <end>$$<start> However , Domitius with difficulty restrained his men , and prevented their beginning a battle ; the more so as a rivulet with steep banks , joining Scipio's camp , retarded the progress of our men . <end>
<start> Quorum studium alacritatemque pugnandi cum cognovisset Scipio , suspicatus fore , ut postero die aut invitus dimicare cogeretur aut magna cum infamia castris se contineret , qui magna exspectatione venisset , temere progressus turpem habuit exitum et noctu ne conclamatis quidem vasis flumen transit atque in eandem partem , ex qua venerat , redit ibique prope flumen edito natura loco castra posuit . <end>$$<start> When Scipio perceived the eagerness and alacrity of our troops to engage , suspecting that he should be obliged the next day , either to fight , against his inclination , or to incur great disgrace by keeping within his camp , though he had come with high expectation , yet by advancing rashly , made a shameful end ; and at night crossed the river , without even giving the signal for breaking up the camp , and returned to the ground from which he came , and there encamped near the river , on an elevated situation . <end>
<start> Paucis diebus interpositis noctu insidias equitum collocavit , quo in loco superioribus fere diebus nostri pabulari consueverant ; et cum cotidiana consuetudine Qu . <end>$$<start> After a few days , he placed a party of horse in ambush in the night , where our men had usually gone to forage for several days before . <end>
<start> Varus , praefectus equitum Domitii , venisset , subito illi ex insidiis consurrexerunt . <end>$$<start> And when Quintus Varus , commander of Domitius's horse , came there as usual , they suddenly rushed from their ambush . <end>
<start> Sed nostri fortiter impetum eorum tulerunt , celeriterque ad suos quisque ordines rediit , atque ultro universi in hostes impetum fecerunt ; ex his circiter LXXX interfectis , reliquis in fugam coniectis , duobus amissis in castra se receperunt . <end>$$<start> But our men bravely supported their charge , and returned quickly every man to his own rank , and in their turn , made a general charge on the enemy ; and having killed about eighty of them , and put the rest to flight , retreated to their camp with the loss of only two men . <end>
<start> His rebus gestis Domitius , sperans Scipionem ad pugnam elici posse , simulavit sese angustiis rei frumentarise adductum castra movere , vasisque militari more conclamatis progressus milia passuum III loco idoneo et occulto omnem exercitum equitatumque collocavit . <end>$$<start> After these transactions , Domitius , hoping to allure Scipio to a battle , pretended to be obliged to change his position through want of corn , and having given the signal for decamping , advanced about three miles , and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place , concealed from the enemy's view . <end>
<start> Qui cum essent progressi , primaeque turmae insidias intravissent , ex fremitu equorum illata suspicione ad suos se recipere coeperunt , quique hos sequebantur celerem eorum receptum conspicati restiterunt . <end>$$<start> Our men , perceiving that the enemy had discovered their plot , and thinking it in vain to wait for any more , having got two troops in their power , intercepted them . <end>
<start> Deductis orae maritimae praesidiis Caesar , ut supra demonstratum est , III cohortes Orici oppidi tuendi causa reliquit isdemque custodiam navium longarum tradidit , quas ex Italia traduxerat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having drawn his garrisons out of the sea-ports , as before mentioned , left three cohorts at Oricum to protect the town , and committed to them the charge of his ships of war , which he had transported from Italy . <end>
<start> Huic officio oppidoque Acilius Caninus legatus praeerat Is naves nostras interiorem in portum post oppidum reduxit et ad terram deligavit faucibusque portus navem onerariam submersam obiecit et huic alteram coniunxit ; super quam turrim effectam ad ipsum introitum portus opposuit et militibus complevit tuendamque ad omnes repentinos casus tradidit . <end>$$<start> Acilius , as lieutenant-general , had the charge of this duty and the command of the town ; he drew the ships into the inner part of the harbor , behind the town , and fastened them to the shore , and sank a merchant-ship in the mouth of the harbor to block it up ; and near it he fixed another at anchor , on which he raised a turret , and faced it to the entrance of the port , and filled it with soldiers , and ordered them to keep guard against any sudden attack . <end>
<start> Quibus cognitis rebus Gnaeus Pompeius filius , qui classi Aegyptiae praeerat , ad Oricum venit submersamque navim remulco multisque contendens funibus adduxit atque alteram navem , quae erat ad custodiam ab Acilio posita , pluribus aggressus navibus , in quibus ad libram fecerat turres , ut ex superiore pugnans loco integrosque semper defatigatis submittens et reliquis partibus simul ex terra scalis et classe moenia oppidi temptans , uti adversariorum manus diduceret , labore et multitudine telorum nostros vicit , deiectisque defensoribus , qui omnes scaphis excepti refugerant , eam navem expugnavit , eodemque tempore ex altera parte molem tenuit naturalem obiectam , quae paene insulam oppidum effecerat , et IIII biremes subiectis scutulis impulsas vectibus in interiorem portum traduxit . <end>$$<start> Cneius , Pompey's son , who commanded the Egyptian fleet , having got intelligence of these things , came to Oricum , and weighed up the ship , that had been sunk , with a windlass , and by straining at it with several ropes , and attacked the other which had been placed by Acilius to watch the port with several ships , on which he had raised very high turrets , so that fighting as it were from an eminence , and sending fresh men constantly to relieve the fatigued , and at the same time attempting the town on all sides by land , with ladders and his fleet , in order to divide the force of his enemies , he overpowered our men by fatigue , and the immense number of darts , and took the ship , having beat off the men that were put on board to defend it , who , however , made their escape in small boats ; and at the , same time he seized a natural mole on the opposite side , which almost formed an island over against the town . <end>
<start> Ita ex utraque parte naves longas aggressus , quae erant deligatae ad terram atque inanes , IIII ex his abduxit , reliquas incendit . <end>$$<start> He carried over land , into the inner part of the harbor , four galleys , by putting rollers under them , and driving them on with levers . <end>
<start> Ipse Lissum profectus naves onerarias XXX a Marcus Antonio relictas intra portum aggressus omnes incendit ; Lissum expugnare conatus defendentibus civibus Romanis , qui eius conventus erant , militibusque , quos praesidii causa miserat Caesar , triduum moratus paucis in oppugnatione amissis re infecta inde discessit . <end>$$<start> He attempted to storm Lissus , but being delayed three days by the vigorous defense of the Roman citizens who belonged to that district , and of the soldiers which Caesar had sent to keep garrison there , and having lost a few men in the assault , he returned without effecting his object . <end>
<start> Caesar , postquam Pompeium ad Asparagium esse cognovit , eodem cum exercitu profectus expugnato in itinere oppido Parthinorum , in quo Pompeius praesidium habebat , tertio die ad Pompeium pervenit iuxtaque eum castra posuit et postridie eductis omnibus copiis acie instructa decernendi potestatem Pompeio fecit . <end>$$<start> As soon as Caesar heard that Pompey was at Asparagium , he set out for that place with his army , and having taken the capital of the Parthinians on his march , where there was a garrison of Pompey's , he reached Pompey in Macedonia , on the third day , and encamped beside him ; and the day following having drawn out all his forces before his camp , he offered Pompey battle . <end>
<start> Ubi illum suis locis se tenere animadvertit , reducto in castra exercitu aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit . <end>$$<start> But perceiving that he kept within his trenches , he led his army back to his camp , and thought of pursuing some other plan . <end>
<start> Itaque postero die omnibus copiis magno circuitu difficili angustoque itinere Dyrrachium profectus est sperans Pompeium aut Dyrrachium compelli aut ab eo intercludi posse , quod omnem commeatum totiusque belli apparatum eo contulisset ; ut accidit Pompeim enim primo ignorans eius consilium , quod diverso ab ea regione itinere profectum videbat , angustiis rei frumentariae compulsum discessisse existimabat ; postea per exploratores certior factus postero die castra movit , breviore itinere se occurrere ei posse sperans . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , the day following , he set out with all his forces by a long circuit , through a difficult and narrow road to Dyrrachium ; hoping , either that Pompey would be compelled to follow him to Dyrrachium , or that his communication with it might be cut off , because he had deposited there all his provisions and material of war . <end>
<start> Pompeim interclusus Dyrrachio , ubi propositum tenere non potuit , secundo usus consilio edito loco , qui appellatur Petra aditumque habet navibus mediocrem atque eas a quibusdam protegit ventis , castra communit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , being cut off from Dyrrachium , as he was unable to effect his purpose , took a new resolution , and intrenched himself strongly on a rising ground , which is called Petra , where ships of a small size can come in , and be sheltered from some winds . <end>
<start> Eo partem navium longarum convenire , frumentum commeatumque ab Asia atque omnibus regionibus , quas tenebat , comportari imperat . <end>$$<start> Here he ordered a part of his men of war to attend him , and corn and provisions to be brought from Asia , and from all the countries of which he kept possession . <end>
<start> Caesar longius bellum ductum iri existimans et de Italicis commeatibus desperans , quod tanta diligentia omni litora a Pompeianis tenebantur , classesque ipsius , quas hieme in Sicilia , Gallia , Italia fecerat , morabantur , in Epirum rei frumentariae causa Quintus Tillium et Lucius Canuleium legatum misit , quodque hae regiones aberant longius , locis certis horrea constituit vecturasque frumenti finitimis civitatibus descripsit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , imagining that the war would be protracted to too great a length , and despairing of his convoys from Italy , because all the coasts were guarded with great diligence by Pompey's adherents ; and because his own fleets , which he had built during the winter , in Sicily , Gaul , and Italy , were detained ; sent Lucius Canuleius into Epirus to procure corn ; and because these countries were too remote , he fixed granaries in certain places , and regulated the carriage of the corn for the neighboring states . <end>
<start> Item Lisso Parthinisque et omnibus castellis quod esset frumenti conquiri iussit . <end>$$<start> He likewise gave directions that search should be made for whatever corn was in Lissus , the country of the Parthini , and all the places of strength . <end>
<start> Id erat perexiguum cum ipsius agri natura , quod sunt loca aspera ac montuosa ac plerumque frumento utuntur importato , tum quod Pompeius haec providerat et superioribus diebus praedae loco Parthinos habuerat frumentumque omne conquisitum spoliatis effossisque eorum domibus per equites comportarat . <end>$$<start> The quantity was very small , both from the nature of the land (for the country is rough and mountainous , and the people commonly import what grain they use) ; and because Pompey had foreseen what would happen , and some days before had plundered the Parthini , and having ravaged and dug up their houses , carried off all the corn , which he collected by means of his horse . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar consilium capit ex loci natura . <end>$$<start> Caesar , on being informed of these transactions , pursued measures suggested by the nature of the country . <end>
<start> Erant enim circum castra Pompei permulti editi atque asperi colles . <end>$$<start> For round Pompey's camps there were several high and rough hills . <end>
<start> Hos primum praesidiis tenuit castellaque ibi communit . <end>$$<start> These he first of all occupied with guards , and raised strong forts on them . <end>
<start> Inde , ut loci cuiusque natura ferebat , ex castello in castellum perducta munitione circumvallare Pompeium instituit , haec spectans , quod angusta re frumentaria utebatur quodque Pompeius multitudine equitum valebat , quo minore periculo undique frumentum commeatumque exercitui supportare posset , simul , uti pabulatione Pompeium prohiberet equitatumque eius ad rem gerendam inutilem efficeret , tertio , ut auctoritatem qua ille maxime apud exteras nationes niti videbatur , minueret , cum fama per orbem terrarum percrebuisset , illum a Caesare obsideri neque audere proelio dimicare . <end>$$<start> Then drawing a fortification from one fort to another , as the nature of each position allowed , he began to draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey , with these views ; as he had but a small quantity of corn , and Pompey was strong in cavalry , that he might furnish his army with corn and other necessaries from all sides with less danger ; secondly , to prevent Pompey from foraging , and thereby render his horse ineffectual in the operations of the war ; and thirdly , to lessen his reputation , on which he saw he depended greatly , among foreign nations , when a report should have spread throughout the world that he was blockaded by Caesar , and dare not hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Pompeins neque a mari Dyrrachioque discedere volebat , quod omnem apparatum belli , tela , arma , tormenta ibi collocaverat frumentumque exercitui navibus supportabat , neque munitiones Caesaris prohibere poterat , nisi proelio decertare vellet ; quod eo tempore statuerat non esse faciendum . <end>$$<start> Neither was Pompey willing to leave the sea and Dyrrachium , because he had lodged his material there , his weapons , arms , and engines ; and supplied his army with corn from it by his ships ; nor was he able to put a stop to Caesar's works without hazarding a battle , which at that time he had determined not to do . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur , ut extremam rationem belli sequens quam plurimos colles occuparet et quam latissimas regiones praesidiis teneret Caesarisque copias , quam maxime posset , distineret ; idque accidit Castellis enim XXIIII effectis XV milia passuum circuitu amplexus hoc spatio pabulabatur ; multaque erant intra eum locum manu sata , quibus interim iumenta pasceret . <end>$$<start> Nothing was left but to adopt the last resource , namely , to possess himself of as many hills as he could , and cover as great an extent of country as possible with his troops , and divide Caesar's forces as much as possible ; and so it happened : for having raised twenty-four forts , and taken in a compass of fifteen miles , he got forage in this space , and within this circuit there were several fields lately sown , in which the cattle might feed in the mean time . <end>
<start> Atque ut nostri perpetua munitione providebant , ne quo loco erumperent Pompeiani ac nostros post tergum adorirentur , ita illi interiore spatio perpetuas munitiones efficiebant , ne quem locum nostri intrare atque ipsos a tergo circumvenire possent . <end>$$<start> And as our men , who had completed their works by drawing lines of communication from one fort to another , were afraid that Pompey's men would sally out from some part , and attack us in the rear ; so the enemy were making a continued fortification in a circuit within ours to prevent us from breaking in on any side , or surrounding them on the rear . <end>
<start> Sed illi operibus vincebant , quod et numero militum praestabant et interiore spatio minorem circuitum habebant . <end>$$<start> But they completed their works first ; both because they had a greater number of men , and because they had a smaller compass to inclose . <end>
<start> Quaecumque erant loca Caesari capienda , etsi prohibere Pompeius totis copiis et dimicare non constituerat , tamen suis locis sagittarios funditoresque mittebat , quorum magnum habebat numerum , multique ex nostris vulnerabantur , magnusque incesserat timor sagittarum , atque omnes fere milites aut ex coactis aut ex centonibus aut ex coriis tunicas aut tegimenta fecerant , quibus tela vitarent . <end>$$<start> When Caesar attempted to gain any place , though Pompey had resolved not to oppose him with his whole force , or to come to a general engagement , yet he detached to particular places slingers and archers , with which his army abounded , and several of our men were wounded , and filled with great dread of the arrows ; and almost all the soldiers made coats or coverings for themselves of hair cloths , tarpaulins , or raw hides to defend them against the weapons . <end>
<start> Dicitur eo tempore glorians apud suos Pompeius dixisse : non recusare se , quin nullius usus imperator existimaretur , si sine maximo detrimento legiones Caesaris sese recepissent inde , quo temere essent progressae . <end>$$<start> It is reported that Pompey said that day in triumph to his friends about him , That he would consent to be accounted a general of no experience , if Caesar's legions effected a retreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they had rashly advanced . <end>
<start> Caesar receptui suorum timens crates ad extremum tumulum contra hostem proferri et adversas locari , intra has mediocri latitudine fossam tectis militibus obduci iussit locumque in omnes partes quam maxime impediri . <end>$$<start> Caesar , being uneasy about the retreat of his soldiers , ordered hurdles to be carried to the further side of the hill , and to be placed opposite to the enemy , and behind them a trench of a moderate breadth to be sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles ; and the ground to be made as difficult as possible . <end>
<start> Ipse idoneis locis funditores instruxit , ut praesidio nostris se recipientibus essent . <end>$$<start> He himself disposed slingers in convenient places to cover our men in their retreat . <end>
<start> His rebus comparatis legionem reduci iussit Pompeiani hoc insolentius atque audacius nostros premere et instare coeperunt cratesque pro munitione obiectas propulerunt , ut fossas transcenderent . <end>$$<start> These things being completed , he ordered his legions to file off : Pompey's men insultingly and boldly pursued and chased us , leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in the front of our works , in order to pass over the trench . <end>
<start> Quod cum animadvertisset Caesar , veritus , ne non reducti , sed reiecti viderentur , maiusque detrimentum caperetur , a medio fere spatio suos per Antonium , qui ei legioni praeerat , cohortatus tuba signum dari atque in hostes impetum fieri iussit . <end>$$<start> Which as soon as Caesar perceived , being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat , but to be repulsed , and that greater loss might be sustained , when his men were almost half way down the hill , he encouraged them by Antonius , who commanded that legion , ordered the signal of battle to be sounded , and a charge to be made on the enemy . <end>
<start> Milites legionis VIIII subito conspirtati pila coniecerunt et ex inferiore loco adversus clivum incitati cursu praecipites Pompeianos egerunt et terga vertere coegerunt ; quibus ad recipiendum crates deiectae longuriique obiecti et institutae fossae magno impedimento fuerunt . <end>$$<start> The soldiers of the ninth legion suddenly closing their files , threw their javelins , and advancing impetuously from the low ground up the steep , drove Pompey's men precipitately before them , and obliged them to turn their backs ; but their retreat was greatly impeded by the hurdles that lay in a long line before them , and the palisadoes which were in their way , and the trenches that were sunk . <end>
<start> Nostri vero , qui satis habebant sine detrimento discedere , compluribus interfectis V omnino suorum amissis quietissime se receperunt pauloque citra eum locum allis comprehensis collibus munitiones perfecerunt . <end>$$<start> But our men being contented to retreat without injury , having killed several of the enemy , and lost but five of their own , very quietly retired , and having seized some other hills somewhat on this side of that place , completed their fortifications . <end>
<start> Erat nova et inusitata belli ratio cum tot castellorum numero tantoque spatio et tantis munitionibus et toto obsidionis genere , tum etiam reliquis rebus . <end>$$<start> This method of conducting a war was new and unusual , as well on account of the number of forts , the extent and greatness of the works , and the manner of attack and defense , as on account of other circumstances . <end>
<start> Nam quicumque alterum obsidere conati sunt , perculsos atque infirmos hostes adorti aut proelio superatos aut aliqua offensione permotos continuerunt , cum ipsi numero equitum militumque praestarent ; causa autem obsidionis haec fere esse consuevit , ut frumento hostes prohiberent . <end>$$<start> For all who have attempted to besiege any person , have attacked the enemy when they were frightened or weak , or after a defeat ; or have been kept in fear of some attack , when they themselves have had a superior force both of foot and horse . <end>
<start> At tum integras atque incolumes copias Caesar inferiore militum numero continebat , cum illi omnium rerum copia abundarent ; cotidie enim magnus undique navium numerus conveniebat , quae commeatum supportarent , neque ullus flare ventus poterat , quin aliqua ex parte secundum cursum haberent . <end>$$<start> Besides , the usual design of a siege is to cut off the enemy's supplies On the contrary , Caesar , with an inferior force , was inclosing troops sound and unhurt , and who had abundance of all things . <end>
<start> Recordabantur enim eadem se superiore anno in Hispania perpessos labore et patientia maximum bellum confecisse , meminerant ad Alesiam magnam se inopiam perpessos , multo etiam maiorem ad Avaricum , maximarum gentium victores discessisse . <end>$$<start> They recollected too that they had suffered an alarming scarcity at Alesia , and a much greater at Avaricum , and yet had returned victorious over mighty nations . <end>
<start> Non illi hordeum cum daretur , non legumina recusabant ; pecus vero cuius rei summa erat ex Epiro copia , magno in honore habebant . <end>$$<start> They refused neither barley nor pulse when offered them , and they held in great esteem cattle , of which they got great quantities from Epirus . <end>
<start> Est autem genus radicis inventum ab eis , qui fuerant vacui ab operibus , quod appellatur chara , quod admixtum lacte multum inopiam levabat . <end>$$<start> There was a sort of root called chara , discovered by the troops which served under Valerius . <end>
<start> Eius erat magna copia . <end>$$<start> They made it into a sort of bread . <end>
<start> Ex hoc effectos panes , cum in colloquiis Pompeiani famem nostris obiectarent , vulgo in eos iaciebant , ut spem eorum minuerent . <end>$$<start> They had great plenty of it ; loaves made of this , when Pompey's men upbraided ours with want , they frequently threw among them to damp their hopes . <end>
<start> Iamque frumenta maturescere incipiebant , atque ipsa spes inopiam sustentabat , quod celeriter se habituros copiam confidebant ; crebraeque voces militum in vigiliis colloquiisque audiebantur , prius se cortice ex arboribus victuros , quam Pompeium e manibus dimissuros . <end>$$<start> The corn was now beginning to ripen , and their hope supported their want , as they were confident of having abundance in a short time . <end>
<start> Libenter etiam ex perfugis cognoscebant equos eorum tolerari , reliqua vero iumenta interisse ; uti autem ipsos valetudine non bona , cum angustiis loci et odore taetro ex multitudine cadaverum et cotidianis laboribus insuetos operum , tum aquae summa inopia affectos . <end>$$<start> For Caesar had either turned the course of all the rivers and streams which ran to the sea , or had dammed them up with strong works . <end>
<start> Omnia enim flumina atque omnes rivos , qui ad mare pertinebant , Caesar aut averterat aut magnis operibus obstruxerat , atque ut erant loca montuosa et aspera , angustias vallium sublicis in terram demissis praesaepserat terramque aggesserat , ut aquam contineret . <end>$$<start> And as the country was mountainous , and the valleys narrow at the bottom , he inclosed them with piles sunk in the ground , and heaped up mold against them to keep in the water . <end>
<start> Itaque illi necessario loca sequi demissa ac palustria et puteos fodere cogebantur atque hunc laborem ad cotidiana opera addebant ; qui tamen fontes a quibusdam praesidiis aberant longius et celeriter aestibus exarescebant . <end>$$<start> And even these springs were at a considerable distance from some of their posts , and soon dried up with the heat . <end>
<start> In novo genere belli novae ab utrisque bellandi rationes reperiebantur . <end>$$<start> In this new kind of war , new methods of managing it were invented by both generals . <end>
<start> Interim certior factus Publius Sulla , quem discedens catris praefecerat Caesar , auxillo cohorti venit cum legionibus duabus ; cuius adventu facile sunt repulsi Pompeiani . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , Publius Sylla , whom Caesar at his departure had left governor of his camp , came up with two legions to assist the cohort ; upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily repulsed . <end>
<start> Neque vero conspectum aut impetum nostrorum tulerunt , primisque deiectis reliqui se verterunt et loco cesserunt . <end>$$<start> Nor did they stand the sight and charge of our men , and the foremost falling , the rest turned their backs and quitted the field . <end>
<start> Sed insequentes nostros , ne longius prosequerentur , Sulla revocavit At plerique existimant , si acrius insequi voluisset , bellum eo die potuisse finire . <end>$$<start> But Sylla called our men in from the pursuit , lest their ardor should carry them too far , but most people imagine that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit , the war might have been ended that day . <end>
<start> Cuius consilium reprehendendum non videtur Aliae enim sunt legati partes atque imperatoris : alter omnia agere ad praescriptum , alter libere ad summam rerum consulere debet . <end>$$<start> His conduct however does not appear to deserve censure ; for the duties of a lieutenant-general , and of a commander-in-chief , are very different ; the one is bound to act entirely according to his instructions , the other to regulate his conduct without control , as occasion requires . <end>
<start> Sulla a Caesare in castris relictus liberatis suis hoc fuit contentus neque proelio decertare voluit , quae res tamen fortasse aliquem reciperet casum , ne imperatorias sibi partes sumpsisse videretur . <end>$$<start> Sylla , being deputed by Caesar to take care of the camp , and having rescued his men , was satisfied with that , and did not desire to hazard a battle (although this circumstance might probably have had a successful issue) , that he might not be thought to have assumed the part of the general . <end>
<start> Nam ex iniquo progressi loco in summo constiterant ; si per declive sese reciperent , nostros ex superiore insequentes loco verebantur ; neque multum ad solis occasum temporis supererat ; spe enim conficiendi negotii prope in noctem rem duxerant . <end>$$<start> If they attempted to retire down the steep , they dreaded the pursuit of our men from the rising ground , and there was but a short time till sunset : for in hopes of completing the business , they had protracted the battle almost till night . <end>
<start> Ita necessario atque ex tempore capto consilio Pompeius tumulum quendam occupavit , qui tantum aberat a nostro castello , ut telum tormento missum adigi non posset . <end>$$<start> Taking therefore measures suited to their exigency , and to the shortness of the time , Pompey possessed himself of an eminence , at such a distance from our fort that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach him . <end>
<start> Hoc consedit loco atque eum communivit omnesque ibi copias continuit . <end>$$<start> Here he took up a position , and fortified it , and kept all his forces there . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore duobus praeterea locis pugnatum est : nam plura castella Pompeius pariter distinendae manus causa temptaverat , ne ex proximis praesidiis succurri posset . <end>$$<start> At the same time , there were engagements in two other places ; for Pompey had attacked several forts at once , in order to divide our forces ; that no relief might be sent from the neighboring posts . <end>
<start> Ita uno die VI proeliis factis , tribus ad Dyrrachium , tribus ad munitiones , cum horum omnium ratio haberetur , ad duorurn milium numero ex Pompeianis cecidisse reperiebamus , evocatos centurionesque complures (in eo fuit numero Valerius Flaccus , Lucius filius , eius , qui praetor Asiam obtinuerat) ; signaque sunt militaria sex relata . <end>$$<start> Thus six engagements having happened in one day , three at Dyrrachium , and three at the fortifications , when a computation was made of the number of slain , we found that about two thousand fell on Pompey's side , several of them volunteer veterans and centurions . <end>
<start> Et cum laboris sui periculique testimonium afferre vellent , milia sagittarum circiter XXX in castellum coniecta Caesari renumeraverunt , scutoque ad eum relato Scaevae centurionis inventa sunt in eo foramina CXX . <end>$$<start> In reward for this man's services , both to himself and the public , Caesar presented to him two hundred thousand pieces of copper money , and declared him promoted from the eighth to the first centurion . <end>
<start> Quem Caesar , ut erat de se meritus et de re publica , donatum milibus CC collaudatumque ab octavis ordinibus ad primipilum se traducere pronuntiavit (eius enim opera castellum magna ex parte conservatum esse constabat) cohortemque postea duplici stipendio , frumento , veste , cibariis militaribusque donis amplissime donavit . <end>$$<start> For it appeared that the fort had been in a great measure saved by his exertions ; and he afterward very amply rewarded the cohorts with double pay , corn , clothing , and other military honors . <end>
<start> Pompeius noctu magnis additis munitionibus reliquis diebus turres exstruxit , et in altitudinem pedum XV effectis operibus vineis eam partem castrorum obtexit , et quinque intermissis diebus alteram noctem subnubilam nactus obstructis omnibus castrorum portis et ad impediendum obicibus obiectis tertia inita vigilia silentio exercitum eduxit et se in antiquas munitiones recepit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , having made great additions to his works in the night , the following days built turrets , and having carried his works fifteen feet high , faced that part of his camp with mantelets ; and after an interval of five days , taking advantage of a second cloudy night , he barricaded all the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit , and about midnight , quietly marched off his army , and retreated to his old fortifications . <end>
<start> Omnibus deinceps diebus Caesar exercitum in aciem aequum in locum produxit , si Pompeius proelio decertare vellet , ut paene castris Pompei legiones subiceret ; tantumque a vallo eius prima acies aberat , uti ne telum tormento adigi posset . <end>$$<start> Aetolia , Acarnania , and Amphilochis , being reduced , as we have related , by Cassius Longinus , and Calvisius Sabinus , Caesar thought he ought to attempt the conquest of Achaia , and to advance further into the country . <end>
<start> Aetolia , Acarnania , Amphilochis per Cassium Longinum et Calvisium Sabinum , ut demonstravimus , receptis temptandam sibi Achaiam ac paulo longius progrediendum existimabat Caesar . <end>$$<start> Every day afterward , Caesar drew up his army on a level ground , and offered Pompey battle , and led his legions almost close to Pompey's camp ; and his front line was at no greater distance from the rampart than that no weapon from their engines could reach it . <end>
<start> Haec cum in Achaia atque apud Dyrrachium gererentur , Scipionemque in Macedoniam venisse constaret , non oblitus pristini instituti Caesar mittit ad eum Aulus Clodium , suum atque illius familiarem , quem ab illo traditum initio et commendatum in suorum necessariorum numero habere instituerat . <end>$$<start> While these things were going forward in Achaia and at Dyrrachium , and when it was certainly known that Scipio was arrived in Macedonia , Caesar , never losing sight of his first intention , sends Clodius to him , an intimate friend to both , whom Caesar , on the introduction and recommendation of Pompey , had admitted into the number of his acquaintance . <end>
<start> Huic dat litteras mandataque ad eum ; quorum haec erat summa : sese omnia de pace expertum nihil adhuc effecisse : hoc arbitrari vitio factum eorum , quos esse auctores eius rei voluisset , quod sua mandata perferre non opportuno tempore ad Pompeium vererentur . <end>$$<start> To this man he gave letters and instructions to Pompey , the substance of which was as follows : That he had made every effort toward peace , and imputed the ill success of those efforts to the fault of those whom he had employed to conduct those negotiations ; because they were afraid to carry his proposals to Pompey at an improper time . <end>
<start> Scipionem ea esse auctoritate , ut non solum libere quae probasset exponere , sed etiam ex magna parte compellere atque errantem regere posset ; praeesse autem suo nomine exercitui , ut praeter auctoritatem vires quoque ad coercendum haberet . <end>$$<start> That Scipio had such authority , that he could not only freely explain what conduct met his approbation , but even in some degree enforce his advice , and govern him Pompey if he persisted in error ; that he commanded an army independent of Pompey , so that besides his authority , he had strength to compel ; and if he did so , all men would be indebted to him for the quiet of Italy , the peace of the provinces , and the preservation of the empire . <end>
<start> Quod si fecisset , quietem Italiae , pacem provinciarum , salutem imperii uni omnes acceptam relaturos Haec ad eum mandata Clodius refert ac primis diebus , ut videbatur , libenter auditus reliquis ad colloquium non admittitur , castigato Scipione a Favonio , ut postea confecto bello reperiebamus , infectaque re sese ad Caeaarem recepit . <end>$$<start> These proposals Clodius made to him , and for some days at the first appeared to have met with a favorable reception , but afterward was not admitted to an audience ; for Scipio being reprimanded by Favonius , as we found afterward when the war was ended , and the negotiation having miscarried , Clodius returned to Caesar . <end>
<start> Caesar , quo facilius equitatum Pompeianum ad Dyrrachium contineret et pabulatione prohiberet , aditus duos , quos esse angustos demonstravimus , magnis operibus praemunivit castellaque his locis posuit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , that he might the more easily keep Pompey's horse inclosed within Dyrrachium , and prevent them from foraging , fortified the two narrow passes already mentioned with strong works , and erected forts at them . <end>
<start> Pompeius , ubi nihil profici equitatu cognovit , paucis intermissis diebus rursus eum navibus ad se intra munitiones recipit . <end>$$<start> Pompey perceiving that he derived no advantage from his cavalry , after a few days had them conveyed back to his camp by sea . <end>
<start> Erat summa inopia pabuli , adeo ut foliis ex arboribus strictis et teneris harundinum radicibus contusis equos alerent (frumenta enim , quae fuerant intra munitiones sata , consumpserant) ; cogebantur Corcyra atque Acarnania longo interiecto navigationis spatio pabulum supportare , quodque erat eius rei minor copia , hordeo adaugere atque his rationibus equitatum tolerare . <end>$$<start> Fodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed his horses upon leaves stripped off the trees , or the tender roots of reeds pounded For the corn which had been sown within the lines was already consumed , and they would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder from Corcyra and Acarnania , over a long tract of sea ; and as the quantity of that fell short , to increase it by mixing barley with it , and by these methods support their cavalry . <end>
<start> Sed postquam non modo hordeum pabulumque omnibus locis herbaeque desectae , sed etiam frons ex arboribus deficiebat , corruptis equis macie conandum sibi aliquid Pompeius de eruptione existimavit . <end>$$<start> But when not only the barley and fodder in these parts were consumed , and the herbs cut away , when the leaves too were not to be found on the trees , the horses being almost starved , Pompey thought he ought to make some attempt by a sally . <end>
<start> Erant apud Caesarem in equitum numero Allobroges duo fratres , Raucillus et Egus , Adbucilli filii , qui principatum in civitate multis annis obtinuerat , singulari virtute homines , quorum opera Caesar omnibus Gallicis bellis optima fortissimaque erat usus . <end>$$<start> In the number of Caesar's cavalry were two Allobrogians , brothers , named Roscillus and Aegus , the sons of Abducillus , who for several years possessed the chief power in his own state ; men of singular valor , whose gallant services Caesar had found very useful in all his wars in Gaul . <end>
<start> His domi ob has causas amplissimos magistratus mandaverat atque eos extra ordinem in senatum legendos curaverat agrosque in Gallia ex hostibus captos praemiaque rei pecuniariae magna tribuerat locupletesque ex egentibus fecerat . <end>$$<start> To them , for these reasons , he had committed the offices of greatest honor in their own country , and took care to have them chosen into the senate at an unusual age , and had bestowed on them lands taken from the enemy , and large pecuniary rewards , and from being needy had made them affluent . <end>
<start> Hi propter virtutem non solum apud Caesarem in honore erant , sed etiam apud exercitum cari habebantur ; sed freti amicitia Caesaris et stulta ac barbara arrogantia elati despiciebant suos stipendiumque equitum fraudabant et praedam omnem domum avertebant . <end>$$<start> Their valor had not only procured them Caesar's esteem , but they were beloved by the whole army But presuming on Caesar's friendship , and elated with the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous people , they despised their countrymen , defrauded their cavalry of their pay , and applied all the plunder to their own use . <end>
<start> Quibus illi rebus permoti universi Caesarem adierunt palamque de eorum iniuriis sunt questi et ad cetera addiderunt falsum ab his equitum numerum deferri , quorum stipendium averterent . <end>$$<start> Displeased at this conduct , their soldiers went in a body to Caesar , and openly complained of their ill usage ; and to their other charges added , that false musters were given in to Caesar , and the surcharged pay applied to their own use . <end>
<start> Caesar neque tempus illud animadversionis esse existimans et multa virtuti corum concedens rem totam distulit ; illos secreto castigavit , quod quaestui equites haberent , monuitque , ut ex sua amicitia omnia exspectarent et ex praeteritis suis officiis reliqua sperarent . <end>$$<start> Caesar , not thinking it a proper time to call them to account , and willing to pardon many faults , on account of their valor , deferred the whole matter , and gave them a private rebuke , for having made a traffic of their troops , and advised them to expect every thing from his friendship , and by his past favors to measure their future hopes . <end>
<start> Magnam tamen haec res illis offensionem et contemptionem ad omnes attulit , idque ita esse cum ex aliorum obiectationibus tum etiam ex domestico iudicio atque animi conscientia intellegebant . <end>$$<start> Of this they became sensible , as well from the reproaches of others , as from the judgment of their own minds , and a consciousness of guilt . <end>
<start> Quos Pompeius , quod erant honesto loco nati et instructi liberaliter magnoque comitatu et multis iumentis venerant virique fortes habebantur et in honore apud Caesarem fuerant , quodque novum et praeter consuetudinem acciderat , omnia sua praesidia circumduxit atque ostentavit Nam ante id tempus nemo aut miles aut eques a Caesare ad Pompeium transierat , cum paene cotidie a Pompeio ad Caesarem perfugerent , vulgo vero universi in Epiro atque Aetolia conscripti milites earumque regionum omnium , quae a Caesare tenebantur . <end>$$<start> As they were persons nobly descended and of liberal education , and had come with a great retinue , and several cattle , and were reckoned men of courage , and had been in great esteem with Caesar , and as it was a new and uncommon event , Pompey carried them round all his works , and made an ostentatious show of them , for till that day , not a soldier , either horse or foot had deserted from Caesar to Pompey , though there were desertions almost every day from Pompey to Caesar : but more commonly among the soldiers levied in Epirus and Aetolia , and in those countries , which were in Caesar's possession . <end>
<start> Sed hi cognitis omnibus rebus , seu quid in munitionibus perfectum non erat , seu quid a peritioribus rei militaris desiderari videbatur , temporibusque rerum et spatiis locorum , custodiarum varia diligentia animadversa , prout cuiusque eorum , qui negotiis praeerant , aut natura aut studium ferebat , haec ad Pompeium omnia detulerunt . <end>$$<start> But the brothers , having been acquainted with all things , either what was incomplete in our works , or what appeared to the best judges of military matters to be deficient , the particular times , the distance of places , and the various attention of the guards , according to the different temper and character of the officer who commanded the different posts , gave an exact account of all to Pompey . <end>
<start> Quibus ille cognitis rebus eruptionisque iam ante capto consilio , ut demonstratum est , tegimenta galeis milites ex viminibus facere atque aggerem iubet comportare . <end>$$<start> Upon receiving this intelligence , Pompey , who had already formed the design of attempting a sally , as before mentioned , ordered the soldiers to make ozier coverings for their helmets , and to provide fascines . <end>
<start> Eodem naves , quas demonstravimus , aggere et levis armaturae militibus completas , quasque ad Dyrrachium naves longas habebat , mittit et , quid a quoque fieri velit , praecipit Ad eas munitiones Caesar Lentulum Marcellinum quaestorem cum legione VIIII positum habebat . <end>$$<start> These things being prepared , he embarked on board small boats and row galleys by night , a considerable number of light infantry and archers , with all their fascines , and immediately after midnight , he marched sixty cohorts drafted from the greater camp and the outposts , to that part of our works which extended toward the sea , and were at the furthest distance from Caesar's greater camp . <end>
<start> Erat eo loco fossa pedum XV et vallum contra hostem in altitudinem pedum X , tantundemque eius valli agger in latitudinem patebat : ab eo intermisso spatio pedum DC alter conversus in contrariam partem erat vallus humiliore paulo munitione . <end>$$<start> At this place , fronting the enemy , there was a ditch fifteen feet wide , and a rampart ten feet high , and the top of the rampart was ten feet in breadth . <end>
<start> Hoc enim superioribus diebus timens Caesar , ne navibus nostri circumvenirentur , duplicem eo loco fecerat vallum , ut , si ancipiti proelio dimicaretur , posset resisti . <end>$$<start> At an interval of six hundred feet from that there was another rampart turned the contrary way , with the works lower . <end>
<start> Sed operum magnitudo et continens omnium dierum labor , quod milium passuum in circuitu XVII munitiones erat complexus , perficiendi spatium non dabat . <end>$$<start> For some days before , Caesar , apprehending that our men might be surrounded by sea , had made a double rampart there , that if he should be attacked on both sides , he might have the means of defending himself . <end>
<start> Itaque contra mare transversum vallum , qui has duas munitiones coniungeret , nondum perfecerat . <end>$$<start> But the extent of the lines , and the incessant labor for so many days , because he had inclosed a circuit of seventeen miles with his works , did not allow time to finish them . <end>
<start> Quae res nota erat Pompeio delata per Allobrogas perfugas , magnumque nostris attulerat incommodum . <end>$$<start> Therefore the transverse rampart which should make a communication between the other two , was not yet completed . <end>
<start> Nam ut ad mare duo cohortes nonae legionis excubuerant , accessere subito prima luce Pompeiani ; simul navibus circumvecti milites in exteriorem vallum tela iaciebant , fossaeque aggere complebantur , et legionarii interioris munitionis defensores scalis admotis tormentis cuiusque generis telisque terrebant , magnaque multitudo sagittariorum ab utraque parte circumfundebatur . <end>$$<start> This circumstance was known to Pompey , being told to him by the Allobrogian deserters , and proved of great disadvantage to us For when our cohorts of the ninth legion were on guard by the sea-side , Pompey's army arrived suddenly by break of day , and their approach was a surprise to our men , and at the same time , the soldiers that came by sea , cast their darts on the front rampart ; and the ditches were filled with fascines : and the legionary soldiers terrified those that defended the inner rampart , by applying the scaling ladders , and by engines and weapons of all sorts , and a vast multitude of archers poured round upon them from every side . <end>
<start> Multum autem ab ictu lapidum , quod unum nostris erat telum , viminea tegimenta galeis imposita defendebant . <end>$$<start> Besides , the coverings of oziers , which they had laid over their helmets , were a great security to them against the blows of stones which were the only weapons that our soldiers had . <end>
<start> Itaque cum omnibus rebus nostri premerentur atque aegre resisterent animadversum est vitium munitionis , quod supra demonstratum est , atque inter duos vallos , qua perfectum opus non erat , Pompeiani navibus eiti in aversos nostros impetum fecerunt atque ex utraque munitione deiectos terga vertere coegerunt . <end>$$<start> And therefore , when our men were oppressed in every manner , and were scarcely able to make resistance , the defect in our works was observed , and Pompey's soldiers , landing between the two ramparts , where the work was unfinished , attacked our men in the rear , and having beat them from both sides of the fortification , obliged them to flee . <end>
<start> Hoc tumultu nuntiato Marcellinus cohortes subsidio nostris laborantibus submittit ex castris ; quae fugientes conspicatae neque illos suo adventu confirmare potuerunt neque ipsae hostium impetum tulerunt . <end>$$<start> Marcellinus , being informed of this disorder , detached some cohorts to the relief of our men , who seeing them flee from the camp , were neither able to persuade them to rally at their approach , nor themselves to sustain the enemy's charge . <end>
<start> Itaque quodcumque addebatur subsidii , id corruptum timore fugientium terrorem et periculum augebat ; hominum enim multitudine receptus impediebatur . <end>$$<start> And in like manner , whatever additional assistance was sent , was infected by the fears of the defeated , and increased the terror and danger . <end>
<start> In eo proelio cum gravi vulnere esset affectus aquilifer et a viribus deficeretur , conspicatus equites nostros , hanc ego , inquit , et vivus multos per annos magna diligentia defendi et nunc moriens eadem fide Caesari restituo . <end>$$<start> For retreat was prevented by the multitude of the fugitives In that battle , when the eagle-bearer was dangerously wounded , and began to grow weak , having got sight of our horse , he said to them , This eagle have I defended with the greatest care for many years , at the hazard of my life , and now in my last moments restore it to Caesar with the same fidelity . <end>
<start> Nolite , obsecro , committere , quod ante in exercitu Caesaris non accidit , ut rei militaris dedecus admittatur , incolumemque ad eum deferte . <end>$$<start> Do not , I conjure you , suffer a dishonor to be sustained in the field , which never before happened to Caesar's army , but deliver it safe into his hands . <end>
<start> Hoc casu aquila conservatur omnibus primae cohortis centurionibus interfectis praeter principem priorem . <end>$$<start> By this accident the eagle was preserved , but all the centurions of the first cohorts were killed , except the principal . <end>
<start> Iamque Pompeiani magna caede nostrorum castris Marcellini appropinquabant non mediocri terrore illato reliquis cohortibus , et Marcus Antonius , qui proximum locum praesidiorum tenebat , ea re nuntiata cum cohortibus XII descendens ex loco superiore cernebatur . <end>$$<start> And now the Pompeians , after great havoc of our troops , were approaching Marcellinus's camp , and had struck no small terror into the rest of the cohorts , when Marcus Antonius , who commanded the nearest fort , being informed of what had happened , was observed descending from the rising ground with twelve cohorts . <end>
<start> Cuius adventus Pompeianos compressit nostrosque firmavit , ut se ex maximo timore colligerent . <end>$$<start> His arrival checked the Pompeians , and encouraged our men to recover from their extreme affright . <end>
<start> Neque multo post Caesar significatione per castella fumo facta , ut erat superioris temporis consuetudo , deductis quibusdam cohortibus ex praesidiis eodem venit . <end>$$<start> And shortly after , Caesar having got notice by the smoke of all the forts , which was the usual signal on such occasions , drafted off some cohorts from the outposts , and went to the scene of action . <end>
<start> Qui cognito detrimento eum animadvertisset Pompeium extra munitiones egressum , castra secundum mare munire , ut libere pabulari posset nec minus aditum navibus haberet , commutata ratione belli , quoniam propositum non tenuerat , castra iuxta Pompeium munire iussit . <end>$$<start> And having there learned the loss he had sustained , and perceiving that Pompey had forced our works , and had encamped along the coast , so that he was at liberty to forage , and had a communication with his shipping , he altered his plan for conducting the war , as his design had not succeeded , and ordered a strong encampment to be made near Pompey . <end>
<start> Qua perfecta munitione animadversum est a speculatoribus Caesaris , cohortes quasdam , quod instar legionis videretur , esse post silvam et in vetera castra duci . <end>$$<start> When this work was finished , Caesar's scouts observed that some cohorts , which to them appeared like a legion , were retired behind the wood , and were on their march to the old camp . <end>
<start> Castrorum sic situs erat Superioribus diebus nona Caesaris legio , cum se obiecisset Pompeianis copiis atque opere , ut demonstravimus , circummuniret , castra eo loco posuit . <end>$$<start> The situation of the two camps was as follows : a few days before , when Caesar's ninth legion had opposed a party of Pompey's troops , and were endeavoring to inclose them , Caesar's troops formed a camp in that place . <end>
<start> Haec silvam quandam contingebant neque longius a mari passibus CCC aberant . <end>$$<start> This camp joined a certain wood , and was not above four hundred paces distant from the sea . <end>
<start> Post mutato consilio quibusdam de causis Caesar paulo ultra eum locum castra transtulit , paucisque intermissis diebus eadem Pompeius occupaverat et , quod eo loco plures erat legiones habiturus , relicto interiore vallo maiorem adiecerat munitionem . <end>$$<start> Afterward , changing his design for certain reasons , Caesar removed his camp to a small distance beyond that place ; and after a few days , Pompey took possession of it , and added more extensive works , leaving the inner rampart standing , as he intended to keep several legions there . <end>
<start> Ita minora castra inclusa maioribus castelli atque arcis locum obtinebant . <end>$$<start> By this means , the lesser camp , included within the greater , answered the purpose of a fort and citadel . <end>
<start> Item ab angulo catrorum sinistro munitionem ad flumen perduxerat circiter passus CCCC , quo liberius a periculo milites aquarentur . <end>$$<start> He had also carried an intrenchment from the left angle of the camp to the river , about four hundred paces , that his soldiers might have more liberty and less danger in fetching water . <end>
<start> Sed is quoque mutato consilio quibusdam de causis , quas commemorari necesse non est , eo loco excesserat . <end>$$<start> But he too , changing his design for reasons not necessary to be mentioned , abandoned the place . <end>
<start> Ita complures dies inania manserant castra ; munitiones quidem omnes integrae erant . <end>$$<start> In this condition the camp remained for several days , the works being all entire . <end>
<start> Eo signa legionis illata speculatores Caesari renuntiarunt . <end>$$<start> Caesar's scouts brought him word that the standard of a legion was carried to this place . <end>
<start> Hoc idem visum ex superioribus quibusdam castellis confirmaverunt . <end>$$<start> That the same thing was seen he was assured by those in the higher forts . <end>
<start> Is locus aberat a novis Pompei castris circiter passus quingentos . <end>$$<start> This place was a half a mile distant from Pompey's new camp . <end>
<start> Hanc legionem sperans Caesar se opprimere posse et cupiens eius diei detrimentum sarcire , reliquit in opere cohortes duas , quae speciem munitionis praeberent ; ipse diverso itinere quam potuit occultissime reliquas cohortes , numero XXXIII , in quibus erat legio nona multis amissis centurionibus deminutoque militum numero , ad legionem Pompei castraque minora duplici acie eduxit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , hoping to surprise this legion , and anxious to repair the loss sustained that day , left two cohorts employed in the works to make an appearance of intrenching himself , and by a different route , as privately as he could , with his other cohorts amounting to thirty-three , among which was the ninth legion , which had lost so many centurions , and whose privates were greatly reduced in number , he marched in two lines against Pompey's legion and his lesser camp . <end>
<start> Neque eum prima opinio fefellit . <end>$$<start> Nor did this first opinion deceive him . <end>
<start> Nam et pervenit prius , quam Pompeius sentire posset , et tametsi erant munitiones castrorum magnae , tamen sinistro cornu , ubi erat ipse , celeriter aggressus Pompeianos ex vallo deturbavit . <end>$$<start> For he reached the place before Pompey could have notice of it ; and though the works were strong , yet having made the attack with the left wing which he commanded in person , he obliged the Pompeians to quit the rampart in disorder . <end>
<start> Erat obiectus portis ericius Hic paulisper est pugnatum , cum irrumpere nostri conarentur , illi castra defenderent , fortissime Tito Pulione , cuius opera proditum exercitum Gaius Antoni demonstravimus , eo loco propugnante . <end>$$<start> A barricade had been raised before the gates , at which a short contest was maintained , our men endeavoring to force their way in , and the enemy to defend the camp ; Titus Pulcio , by whose means we have related that Caius Antonius's army was betrayed , defending them with singular courage . <end>
<start> Sed tamen nostri virtute vicerunt excisoque ericio primo in maiora castra , post etiam in castellum , quod erat inclusum maioribus castris , irruperunt , quo pulsa legio sese receperat , et nonnullos ibi repugnantes interfecerunt . <end>$$<start> But the valor of our men prevailed , and having cut down the barricade , they first forced the greater camp , and after that the fort which was inclosed within it ; and as the legion on its repulse had retired to this , they slew several defending themselves there . <end>
<start> Sed fortuna , quae plurimum potest cum in reliquis rebus tum praecipue in bello , parvis momentis magnas rerum commutationes efficit ; ut tum accidit . <end>$$<start> But Fortune who exerts a powerful influence as well in other matters , as especially in war , effects great changes from trifling causes , as happened at this time . <end>
<start> Munitionem , quam pertinere a castris ad flumen supra demonstravimus , dextri Caesaris cornu cohortes ignorantia loci sunt secutae , cum portam quaererent castrorumque eam munitionem esse arbitrarentur . <end>$$<start> For the cohorts on Caesar's right wing , through ignorance of the place , followed the direction of that rampart which ran along from the camp to the river , while they were in search of a gate , and imagined that it belonged to the camp . <end>
<start> Quod cum esset animadversum coniunctam esse flumini , prorutis munitionibus defendente nullo transcenderunt , omnisque noster equitatus eas cohortes est secutus . <end>$$<start> But when they found that it led to the river , and that nobody opposed them , they immediately climbed over the rampart , and were followed by all our cavalry . <end>
<start> Interim Pompeius hac satis longa interiecta mora et re nuntiata V legiones ab opere deductas subsidio suis duxit , eodemque tempore equitatus eius nostris equitibus appropinquabat , et acies instructa a nostris , qui castra occupaverant , cernebatur , omniaque sunt subito mutata . <end>$$<start> In the mean time Pompey , by the great delay which this occasioned , being informed of what had happened , marched with the fifth legion , which he called away from their work to support his party ; and at the same time his cavalry were advancing up to ours , and an army in order of battle , was seen at a distance by our men who had taken possession of the camp , and the face of affairs was suddenly changed . <end>
<start> Legio Pompeiana celeris spe subsidii confirmata ab decumana porta resistere conabatur atque ultro in nostros impetum faciebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar's cavalry , who had mounted the rampart by a narrow breach , being apprehensive of their retreat , were the first to flee . <end>
<start> His tantis malis haec subsidia succurrebant , quo minus omnis deleretur exercitus , quod Pompeius insidias timens , credo , quod haec praeter spem acciderant eius , qui paulo ante ex castris fugientes suos conspexerat , munitionibus appropinquare aliquamdiu non audebat , equitesque eius angustis spatiis atque his ab Caesaris militibus occupatis ad insequendum tardabantur . <end>$$<start> In this calamity , the following favorable circumstance occurred to prevent the ruin of our whole army , viz , that Pompey suspecting an ambuscade (because , as I suppose , the success had far exceeded his hopes , as he had seen his men a moment before fleeing from the camp) , durst not for some time approach the fortification ; and that his horse were retarded from pursuing , because the passes and gates were in possession of Caesar's soldiers . <end>
<start> Duobus his unius diei proeliis Caesar desideravit milites DCCCCLX et notos equites Romanos Tuticanum Gallum , senatoris filium , Gaius Fleginatem Placentia , Aulus Granium Puteolis , Marcus Sacrativirum Capua , tribunos militum et centuriones XXXII ; sed horum omnium pars magna in fossis munitionibusque et fluminis ripis oppressa suorum in terrore ac fuga sine ullo vulnere interiit ; signaque sunt militaria amissa XXXII . <end>$$<start> In the two actions of this day , Caesar lost nine hundred and sixty rank and file , several Roman knights of distinction , Felginas Tuticanus Gallus , a senator's son ; Caius Felginas from Placentia ; Aulus Gravius from Puteoli ; Marcus Sacrativir from Capua ; and thirty-two military tribunes and centurions . <end>
<start> Hoc nomen obtinuit atque ita se postea salutari passus est , sed neque in litteris scribere est solitus , neque in fascibus insignia laureae praetulit . <end>$$<start> But neither in his letters to the senate , nor in the fasces , did he use the laurel as a mark of honor . <end>
<start> At Labienus , cum ab eo impetravisset , ut sibi captivos tradi iuberet , omnes productos ostentationis , ut videbatur , causa , quo maior perfugae fides haberetur , commilitones appellans et magna verborum contumelia interrogans , solerentne veterani milites fugere , in omnium conspectu interfecit . <end>$$<start> But Labienus , having obtained his consent that the prisoners should be delivered up to him , had them all brought out , as it appeared , to make a show of them , and that Pompey might place a greater confidence in him who was a deserter ; and calling them fellow soldiers , and asking them in the most insulting manner whether it was usual with veterans to flee , ordered them to be put to death in the sight of the whole army . <end>
<start> His rebus tantum fiduciae ac spiritus Pompeianis accessit , ut non de ratione belli cogitarent , sed vicisse iam viderentur . <end>$$<start> Pompey's party were so elated with confidence and spirit at this success , that they thought no more of the method of conducting the war , but thought that they were already conquerors . <end>
<start> Non illi paucitatem nostrorum militum , non iniquitatem loci atque angustias praeoccupatis castris et ancipitem terrorem intra extraque munitiones , non abscisum in duas partes exercitum , cum altera alteri auxilium ferre non posset , causae fuisse cogitabant . <end>$$<start> They did not consider that the smallness of our numbers , and the disadvantage of the place and the confined nature of the ground occasioned by their having first possessed themselves of the camp , and the double danger both from within and without the fortifications , and the separation of the army into two parts , so that the one could not give relief to the other , were the causes of our defeat . <end>
<start> Non ad haec addebant non concursu acri facto , non proelio dimicatum , sibique ipsos multitudine atque angustiis maius attulisse detrimentum , quam ab hoste accepissent . <end>$$<start> They did not consider , in addition , that the contest was not decided by a vigorous attack , nor a regular battle ; and that our men had suffered greater loss from their numbers and want of room , than they had sustained from the enemy . <end>
<start> Non denique communes belli casus recordabantur , quam parvulae saepe causae vel falsae suspicionis vel terroris repentini vel obiectae religionis magna detrimenta intulissent , quotiens vel ducis vitio vel culpa tribuni in exercitu esset offensum ; sed , proinde ac si virtute vicissent , neque ulla commutatio rerum posset accidere , per orbem terrarum fama ac litteris victoriam eius diei concelebrabant . <end>$$<start> In fine , they did not reflect on the common casualties of war ; how trifling causes , either from groundless suspicions , sudden affright , or religious scruples , have oftentimes been productive of considerable losses ; how often an army has been unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general , or the oversight of a tribune ; but as if they had proved victorious by their valor , and as if no change could ever take place , they published the success of the day throughout the world by reports and letters . <end>
<start> Caesar a superioribus consiliis depulsus omnem sibi commutandam belli rationem existimavit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , disappointed in his first intentions , resolved to change the whole plan of his operations . <end>
<start> Hac habita contione nonnullos signiferos ignominia notavit ac loco movit Exercitui quidem omni tantus incessit ex incommodo dolor tantumque studium infamiae sarciendae , ut nemo aut tribuni aut centurionis imperium desideraret , et sibi quisque etiam poenae loco graviores imponeret labores , simulque omnes arderent cupiditate pugnandi , cum superioris etiam ordinis nonnulli ratione permoti manendum eo loco et rem proelio committendam existimarent . <end>$$<start> Having concluded his speech , he disgraced some standard-bearers , and reduced them to the ranks ; for the whole army was seized with such grief at their loss and with such an ardent desire of repairing their disgrace , that not a man required the command of his tribune or centurion , but they imposed each on himself severer labors than usual as a punishment , and at the same time were so inflamed with eagerness to meet the enemy , that the officers of the first rank , sensibly affected at their entreaties , were of opinion that they ought to continue in their present posts , and commit their fate to the hazard of a battle . <end>
<start> Contra ea Caesar neque satis militibus perterritis confidebat spatiumque interponendum ad recreandos animos putabat , et relictis munitionibus magnopere rei frumentariae timebat . <end>$$<start> But , on the other hand , Caesar could not place sufficient confidence in men so lately thrown into consternation , and thought he ought to allow them time to recover their dejected spirits ; and having abandoned his works , he was apprehensive of being distressed for want of corn . <end>
<start> Itaque nulla interposita mora sauciorum modo et aegrorum habita ratione impedimenta omnia silentio prima nocte ex castris Apolloniam praemisit Haec conquiescere ante iter confectum vetuit . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , suffering no time to intervene but what was necessary for a proper attention to be paid to the sick and wounded , he sent on all his baggage privately in the beginning of the night from his camp to Apollonia , and ordered them not to halt till they had performed their journey ; and he detached one legion with them as a convoy . <end>
<start> His una legio missa praesidio est His explicitis rebus duas in castris legiones retinuit , reliquas de quarta vigilia compluribus portis eductas eodem itinere praemisit parvoque spatio intermisso , ut et militare institutum servaretur , et quam serissime eius profectio cognosceretur conclamari iussit statimque egressus et novissimum agmen consecutus celeriter ex conspectu castrorum discessit . <end>$$<start> This affair being concluded , having retained only two legions in his camp , he marched the rest of his army out at three o'clock in the morning by several gates , and sent them forward by the same route ; and in a short space after , that the military practice might be preserved , and his march known as late as possible , he ordered the signal for decamping to be given ; and setting out immediately and following the rear of his own army , he was soon out of sight of the camp . <end>
<start> Neque vero Pompeius cognito consilio eius moram ullam ad insequendum intulit ; sed eodem spectans , si itinere impeditos perterritos deprehendere posset , exercitum e castris eduxit equitatumque praemisit ad novissimum agmen demorandum , neque consequi potuit , quod multum expedito itinere antecesserat Caesar . <end>$$<start> Nor did Pompey , as soon as he had notice of his design , make any delay to pursue him ; but with a view to surprise them while encumbered with baggage on their march , and not yet recovered from their fright , he led his army out of his camp , and sent his cavalry on to retard our rear ; but was not able to come up with them , because Caesar had got far before him , and marched without baggage . <end>
<start> Sed cum ventum esset ad flumen Genusum , quod ripis erat impeditis , consecutus equitatus novissimos proelio detinebat . <end>$$<start> But when we reached the river Genusus , the banks being steep , their horse overtook our rear , and detained them by bringing them to action . <end>
<start> Huic suos Caesar equites opposuit expeditosque antesignanos admiscuit CCCC ; qui tantum profecerunt , ut equestri proelio commisso pellerent omnes compluresque interficerent ipsique incolumes se ad agmen reciperent . <end>$$<start> To oppose whom , Caesar sent his horse , and intermixed with them about four hundred of his advanced light troops , who attacked their horse with such success , that having routed them all , and killed several , they returned without any loss to the main body . <end>
<start> Confecto iusto itinere eius diei Caesar traductoque exercitu flumen Genusum veteribus suis in castris contra Asparagium consedit militesque omnes intra vallum continuit equitatumque per causam pabulandi emissum confestim decumana porta in castra se recipere iussit . <end>$$<start> Having performed the exact march which he had proposed that day , and having led his army over the river Genusus , Caesar posted himself in his old camp opposite Asparagium ; and kept his soldiers close within the intrenchments and ordered the horse , who had been sent out under pretense of foraging , to retire immediately into the camp , through the Decuman gate . <end>
<start> Simili ratione Pompeius confecto eius diei itinere in suis veteribus castris ad Asparagium consedit Eius milites , quod ab opere integris munitionibus vacabant , alii lignandi pabulandique causa longius progrediebantur , alii , quod subito consilium profectionis ceperant magna parte impedimentorum et sarcinarum relicta , ad haec repetenda invitati propinquitate superiorum castrorum , depositis in contubernio armis , vallum relinquebant . <end>$$<start> Pompey , in like manner , having completed the same day's march , took post in his old camp at Asparagium ; and his soldiers , as they had no work (the fortifications being entire) , made long excursions , some to collect wood and forage ; others , invited by the nearness of the former camp , laid up their arms in their tents , and quitted the intrenchments in order to bring what they had left behind them , because the design of marching being adopted in a hurry , they had left a considerable part of their wagons and luggage behind . <end>
<start> Quibus ad sequendum impeditis Caesar , quod fore providerat , meridiano fere tempore signo profectionis dato exercitum educit duplicatoque eius diei itinere VIII milia passuum ex eo loco procedit ; quod facere Pompeius discessu militum non potuit . <end>$$<start> Being thus incapable of pursuing , as Caesar had foreseen , about noon he gave the signal for marching , led out his army , and doubling that day's march , he advanced eight miles beyond Pompey's camp ; who could not pursue him , because his troops were dispersed . <end>
<start> Postero die Caesar similiter praemissis prima nocte impedimentis de quarta vigilia ipse egreditur , ut , si qua esset imposita dimicandi necessitas , subitum casum expedito exercitu subiret . <end>$$<start> The next day Caesar sent his baggage forward early in the night , and marched off himself immediately after the fourth watch : that if he should be under the necessity of risking an engagement , he might meet a sudden attack with an army free from incumbrance . <end>
<start> Hoc idem reliquis fecit diebus Quibus rebus perfectum est , ut altissimis fluminibus atque impeditissimis itineribus nullum acciperet incommodum . <end>$$<start> He did so for several days successively , by which means he was enabled to effect his march over the deepest rivers , and through the most intricate roads without any loss . <end>
<start> Pompeius primi diei mora illata et reliquorum dierum frustra labore suscepto , cum se magnis itineribus extenderet et praegressos consequi cuperet , quarto die finem sequendi fecit atque aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit . <end>$$<start> For Pompey , after the first day's delay , and the fatigue which he endured for some days in vain , though he exerted himself by forced marches , and was anxious to overtake us , who had got the start of him , on the fourth day desisted from the pursuit , and determined to follow other measures . <end>
<start> Caesari ad saucios deponendos , stipendium exercitui dandum , socios confirmandos , praesidium urbibus relinquendum necesse erat adire Apolloniam . <end>$$<start> Caesar was obliged to go to Apollonia , to lodge his wounded , pay his army , confirm his friends , and leave garrisons in the towns . <end>
<start> Sed his rebus tantum temporis tribuit , quantum erat properanti necesse ; timens Domitio , ne adventu Pompei praeoccuparetur , ad eum omni celeritate et studio incitatus ferebatur . <end>$$<start> But for these matters , he allowed no more time than was necessary for a person in haste . <end>
<start> Totius autem rei consilium his rationibus explicabat , ut , si Pompeius eodem contenderet , abductum ilium a mari atque ab eis copiis , quas Dyrrachii comparaverat , abstractum pari condicione belli secum decertare cogeret ; si in Italiam transiret , coniuncto exercitu cum Domitio per Illyricum Italiae subsidio proficisceretur ; si Apolloniam Oricumque oppugnare et se omni maritima ora excludere conaretur , obsesso Scipione necessario illum suis auxilium ferre cogeret . <end>$$<start> And being apprehensive for Domitius , lest he should be surprised by Pompey's arrival , he hastened with all speed and earnestness to join him ; for he planned the operations of the whole campaign on these principles : that if Pompey should march after him , he would be drawn off from the sea , and from those forces which he had provided in Dyrrachium , and separated from his corn and magazines , and be obliged to carry on the war on equal terms ; but if he crossed over into Italy , Caesar , having effected a junction with Domitius , would march through Illyricum to the relief of Italy ; but if he endeavored to storm Apollonia and Oricum , and exclude him from the whole coast , he hoped , by besieging Scipio , to oblige him , of necessity , to come to his assistance . <end>
<start> Itaque praemissis nuntiis ad Gnaeus Domitium Caesar ei scripsit et , quid fieri vellet , ostendit , praesidioque Apolloniae cohortibus IIII , Lissi I , III Orici relictis , quique erant ex vulneribus aegri depositis , per Epirum atque Athamaniam iter facere coepit . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , Caesar dispatching couriers , writes to Domitius , and acquaints him with his wishes on the subject : and having stationed a garrison of four cohorts at Apollonia , one at Lissus , and three at Oricum , besides those who were sick of their wounds , he set forward on his march through Epirus and Acarnania . <end>
<start> Pompeius quoque de Caesaris consilio coniectura iudicans ad Scipionem properandum sibi existimabat : si Caesar iter illo haberet , ut subsidium Scipioni ferret ; si ab ora maritima Oricoque discedere nollet , quod legiones equitatumque ex Italia exspectaret , ipse ut omnibus copiis Domitium aggrederetur . <end>$$<start> Pompey , also , guessing at Caesar's design , determined to hasten to Scipio , that if Caesar should march in that direction , he might be ready to relieve him ; but that if Caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and Corcyra , because he expected legions and cavalry from Italy , he himself might fall on Domitius with all his forces . <end>
<start> His de causis uterque eorum celeritati studebat , et suis ut esset auxilio , et ad opprimendos adversarios ne occasioni temporis deesset . <end>$$<start> For these reasons , each of them studied dispatch , that he might succor his friends , and not miss an opportunity of surprising his enemies . <end>
<start> Sed Caesarem Apollonia a directo itinere averterat ; Pompeius per Candaviam iter in Macedoniam expeditum habebat . <end>$$<start> But Caesar's engagements at Apollonia had carried him aside from the direct road . <end>
<start> Accessit etiam ex improviso aliud incommodum , quod Domitius , qui dies complures castris Scipionis castra collata habuisset , rei frumentariae causa ab eo discesserat et Heracliam , quae est subiecta Candaviae , iter fecerat , ut ipsa fortuna illum obicere Pompeio videretur . <end>$$<start> Pompey had taken the short road to Macedonia , through Candavia To this was added another unexpected disadvantage , that Domitius , who for several days had been encamped opposite Scipio , had quitted that post for the sake of provisions , and had marched to Heraclea Sentica , a city subject to Candavia ; so that fortune herself seemed to throw him in Pompey's way . <end>
<start> Haec ad id tempus Caesar ignorabat . <end>$$<start> Of this , Caesar was ignorant up to this time . <end>
<start> Simul a Pompeio litteris per omnes provincias civitatesque dimissis proelio ad Dyrrachium facto latius inflatiusque multo , quam res erat gesta , fama percrebuerat , pulsum fugere Caesarem paene omnibus copiis amissis ; haec itinera infesta reddiderat , haec civitates nonnullas ab eius amicitia avertebat . <end>$$<start> Letters likewise being sent by Pompey through all the provinces and states , with an account of the action at Dyrrachium , very much enlarged and exaggerated beyond the real facts , a rumor had been circulated , that Caesar had been defeated and forced to flee , and had lost almost all his forces . <end>
<start> Sed Allobroges , Raucilli atque Egi familiares , quos perfugisse ad Pompeium demonstravimus , conspicati in itinere exploratores Domitii , seu pristina sua consuetudine , quod una in Gallia bella gesserant , seu gloria elati cuncta , ut erant acta , euerunt et Caesaris profectionem et adventum Pompei docuerunt . <end>$$<start> But the Allobroges , who were in the retinue of Aegus and Roscillus , and who had deserted to Pompey , having met on the road a scouting party of Domitius ; either from old acquaintance , because they had served together in Gaul , or elated with vain glory , gave them an account of all that had happened , and informed them of Caesar's departure , and Pompey's arrival . <end>
<start> A quibus Domitius certior factus vix IIII horarum spatio antecedens hostium beneficio periculum vitavit et ad Aeginium , quod est oppidum obiectum Thessaliae , Caesari venienti occurrit . <end>$$<start> Domitius , who was scarce four hours' march distant , having got intelligence from these , by the courtesy of the enemy , avoided the danger , and met Caesar coming to join him at Aeginium , a town on the confines of and opposite to Thessaly . <end>
<start> Coniuncto exercitu Caesar Gomphos pervenit , quod est oppidum primum Thessaliae venientibus ab Epiro ; quae gens paucis ante mensibus ultro ad Caesarem legatos miserat , ut suis omnibus facultatibus uteretur , praesidiumque ab eo militum petierat . <end>$$<start> The two armies being united , Caesar marched to Gomphi , which is the first town of Thessaly on the road from Epirus Now , the Thessalians , a few months before , had of themselves sent embassadors to Caesar , offering him the free use of every thing in their power , and requesting a garrison for their protection . <end>
<start> Sed eo fama iam praecurrerat , quam supra docuimus , de proelio Dyrrachino , quod multis auxerat partibus . <end>$$<start> But the report , already spoken of , of the battle at Dyrrachium , which it had exaggerated in many particulars , had arrived before him . <end>
<start> Itaque Androsthenes , praetor Thessaliae , cum se victoriae Pompei comitem esse mallet quam socium Caesaris in rebus adversis , omnem ex agris multitudinem servorum ac liberorum in oppidum cogit portasque praecludit et ad Scipionem Pompeiumque nuntios mittit , ut sibi subsidio veniant : se confidere munitionibus oppidi , si celeriter succurratur ; longinquam oppugnationem sustinere non posse . <end>$$<start> In consequence of which , Androsthenes , the praetor of Thessaly , as he preferred to be the companion of Pompey's victory , rather than Caesar's associate in his misfortunes , collected all the people , both slaves and freemen from the country into the town and shut the gates , and dispatched messengers to Scipio and Pompey to come to his relief , that he could depend on the strength of the town , if succor was speedily sent ; but that it could not withstand a long siege . <end>
<start> Scipio discessu exercituum ab Dyrrachio cognito Larisam legiones adduxerat ; Pompeius nondum Thessaliae appropinquabat . <end>$$<start> Scipio , as soon as he received advice of the departure of the armies from Dyrrachium , had marched with his legions to Larissa : Pompey was not yet arrived near Thessaly . <end>
<start> Caesar castris munitis scalas musculosque ad repentinam oppugnationem fieri et crates parari iussit . <end>$$<start> Caesar having fortified his camp , ordered scaling-ladders and pent-houses to be made for a sudden assault , and hurdles to be provided . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus effectis cohortatus milites docuit , quantum usum haberet ad sublevandam omnium rerum inopiam potiri oppido pleno atque opulento , simul reliquis civitatibus huius urbis exemplo inferre terrorem et id fieri celeriter , priusquam auxilia concurrerent . <end>$$<start> As soon as they were ready , he exhorted his soldiers , and told them of what advantage it would be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries , if they made themselves masters of a rich and plentiful town : and , at the same time to strike terror into other states by the example of this , and to effect this with speed , before auxiliaries could arrive . <end>
<start> Itaque usus singulari militum studio eodem , quo venerat , die post horam nonam oppidum altissimis moenibus oppugnare aggressus ante solis oocasum expugnavit et ad diripiendum militibus concessit statimque ab oppido castra movit et Metropolim venit , sic ut nuntios expugnati oppidi famamque antecederet . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , taking advantage of the unusual ardor of the soldiers , he began his assault on the town at a little after three o'clock on the very day on which he arrived , and took it , though defended with very high walls , before sunset , and gave it up to his army to plunder , and immediately decamped from before it , and marched to Metropolis , with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumor of the taking of Gomphi . <end>
<start> Metropolitae primum eodem usi consilio isdem permoti rumoribus portas clauserunt murosque armatis compleverunt ; sed postea casu civitatis Gomphensis cognito ex captivis , quos Caesar ad murum producendos curaverat , portas aperuerunt . <end>$$<start> The inhabitants of Metropolis , at first influenced by the same rumors , followed the same measures , shut the gates and manned their walls . <end>
<start> Quibus diligentissime conservatis collata fortuna Metropolitum cum casu Gomphensium nulla Thessaliae fuit civitas praeter Larisaeos , qui magnis exercitibus Scipionis tenebantur , quin Caesari parerent atque imperata facerent . <end>$$<start> As he preserved them with the greatest care , there was not a state in Thessaly (except Larissa , which was awed by a strong army of Scipio's) , but on comparing the fate of the inhabitants of Metropolis with the severe treatment of Gomphi , gave admission to Caesar , and obeyed his orders . <end>
<start> Pompeius paucis post diebus in Thessaliam pervenit contionatusque apud cunctum exercitum suis agit gratias , Scipionis milites cohortatur , ut parta iam victoria praedae ac praemiorum velint esse participes , receptisque omnibus in una castra legionibus suum cum Scipione honorem partitur classicumque apud eum cani et alterum illi iubet praetorium tendi . <end>$$<start> Pompey arrived in Thessaly a few days after , and having harangued the combined army , returned thanks to his own men , and exhorted Scipio's soldiers , that as the victory was now secured , they should endeavor to merit a part of the rewards and booty . <end>
<start> Auctis copiis Pompei duobusque magnis exercitibus coniunctis pristina omnium confirmatur opinio , et spes victoriae augetur , adeo ut , quicquid intercederet temporis , id morari reditum in Italiam videretur , et si quando quid Pompeius tardius aut consideratius faceret , unius esse negotium diei , sed illum delectari imperio et consulares praetoriosque servorum habere numero dicerent . <end>$$<start> And receiving all the legions into one camp , he shared his honors with Scipio , ordered the trumpet to be sounded at his tent , and a pavilion to be erected for him The forces of Pompey being thus augmented , and two such powerful armies united , their former expectations were confirmed , and their hopes of victory so much increased , that whatever time intervened was considered as so much delay to their return into Italy ; and whenever Pompey acted with slowness and caution , they used to exclaim , that it was the business only of a single day , but that he had a passion for power , and was delighted in having persons of consular and praetorian rank in the number of his slaves . <end>
<start> Iamque inter se palam de praemiis ac de sacerdotiis contendebant in annosque consulatum definiebant , alii domos bonaque eorum , qui in castris erant Caesaris , petebant ; magnaque inter eos in consilio fuit controversia , oporteretne Lucili Hirri , quod is a Pompeio ad Parthos missus esset , proximis comitiis praetoriis absentis rationem haberi , cum eius necessarii fidem implorarent Pompei , praestaret , quod proficiscenti recepisset , ne per eius auctoritatem deceptus videretur , reliqui , in labore pari ac periculo ne unus omnes antecederet , recusarent . <end>$$<start> And they now began to dispute openly about rewards and priesthoods , and disposed of the consulate for several years to come Others put in their claims for the houses and properties of all who were in Caesar's camp , and in that council there was a warm debate , whether Lucius Hirtius , who had been sent by Pompey against the Parthians , should be admitted a candidate for the praetorship in his absence at the next election ; his friends imploring Pompey's honor to fulfill the engagements which he had made to him at his departure , that he might not seem deceived through his authority : while others , embarked in equal labor and danger , pleaded that no individual ought to have a preference before all the rest . <end>
<start> Iam de sacerdotio Caesaris Domitius , Scipio Spintherque Lentulus cotidianis contentionibus ad gravissimas verborum contumelias palam descenderunt , cum Lentulus aetatis honorem ostentaret , Domitius urbanam gratiam dignitatemque iactaret , Scipio affinitate Pompei confideret . <end>$$<start> Already Domitius , Scipio , and Lentulus Spinther , in their daily quarrels about Caesar's priesthood , openly abused each other in the most scurrilous language . <end>
<start> Postulavit etiam Lucius Afranium proditionis exercitus Acutius Rufus apud Pompeium , quod gestum in Hispania diceret . <end>$$<start> Lentulus urging the respect due to his age , Domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity , and Scipio presuming on his alliance with Pompey . <end>
<start> Et Lucius Domitius in consilio dixit placere sibi bello confecto ternas tabellas dari ad iudicandum eis , qui ordinis essent senatorii belloque una cum ipsis interfuissent , sententiasque de singulis ferrent , qui Romae remansissent quique intra praesidia Pompei fuissent neque operam in re militari praestitissent : unam fore tabellam , qui liberandos omni periculo censerent ; alteram , qui capitis damnarent ; tertiam , qui pecunia multarent . <end>$$<start> Attius Rufus charged Lucius Afranius before Pompey with betraying the army in the action that happened in Spain , and Lucius Domitius declared in the council that it was his wish that , when the war should be ended , three billets should be given to all the senators , who had taken part with them in the war , and that they should pass sentence on every single person who had staid behind at Rome , or who had been within Pompey's garrisons and had not contributed their assistance in the military operations ; that by the first billet they should have power to acquit , by the second to pass sentence of death , and by the third to impose a pecuniary fine . <end>
<start> Postremo omnes aut de honoribus suis aut de praemiis pecuniae aut de persequendis inimicitiis agebant nec , quibus rationibus superare possent , sed , quemadmodum uti victoria deberent , cogitabant . <end>$$<start> In short , Pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the honors or sums of money which were to be their rewards , or of vengeance on their enemies ; and never considered how they were to defeat their enemies , but in what manner they should use their victory . <end>
<start> Re frumentaria praeparata confirmatisque militibus et satis longo spatio temporis a Dyrrachinis proeliis intermisso , quo satis perspectum habere militum animum videretur , temptandum Caesar existimavit , quidnam Pompeius propositi aut voluntatis ad dimicandum haberet . <end>$$<start> Corn being provided , and his soldiers refreshed , and a sufficient time having elapsed since the engagement at Dyrrachium , when Caesar thought he had sufficiently sounded the disposition of his troops , he thought that he ought to try whether Pompey had any intention or inclination to come to a battle . <end>
<start> Itaque exercitum ex castris eduxit aciemque instruxit , primum suis locis pauloque a castris Pompei longius , continentibus vero diebus , ut progrederetur a castris suis collibusque Pompeianis aciem subiceret . <end>$$<start> Accordingly he led his troops out of the camp , and ranged them in order of battle , at first on their own ground , and at a small distance from Pompey's camp : but afterward for several days in succession , he advanced from his own camp , and led them up to the hills on which Pompey's troops were posted , which conduct inspired his army every day with fresh courage . <end>
<start> Quae res in dies confirmatiorem eius exercitum efficiebat Superius tamen institutum in equitibus , quod demonstravimus , servabat , ut , quoniam numero multis partibus esset inferior , adulescentes atque expeditos ex antesignanis electis ad pernicitatem armis inter equites proeliari iuberet , qui cotidiana consuetudine usum quoque eius generis proeliorum perciperent . <end>$$<start> However he adhered to his former purpose respecting his cavalry , for as he was by many degrees inferior in number , he selected the youngest and most active of the advanced guard , and desired them to fight intermixed with the horse , and they by constant practice acquired experience in this kind of battle . <end>
<start> His erat rebus effectum , ut equitum mille etiam apertioribus locis VII milium Pompeianorum impetum , cum adesset usus , sustinere auderent neque magnopere eorum multitudine terrerentur . <end>$$<start> By these means it was brought to pass that a thousand of his horse would dare even on open ground , to stand against seven thousand of Pompey's , if occasion required , and would not be much terrified by their number . <end>
<start> Namque etiam per eos dies proelium secundum equestre fecit atque unum Allobrogem ex duobus , quos perfugisse ad Pornpeium supra docuimus , cum quibusdam interfecit . <end>$$<start> For even on one of those days he was successful in a cavalry action , and killed one of the two Allobrogians , who had deserted to Pompey , as we before observed , and several others . <end>
<start> Pompeius , qui castra in colle habebat , ad infimas radices montis aciem instruebat semper , ut videbatur , exspectans , si iniquis locis Caesar se subiceret . <end>$$<start> Pompey , because he was encamped on a hill , drew up his army at the very foot of it , ever in expectation , as may be conjectured , that Caesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous situation . <end>
<start> Caesar nulla ratione ad pugnam elici posse Pompeium existimans hanc sibi commodissimam belli rationem iudicavit , uti castra ex eo loco moveret semperque esset in itineribus , haec spectans , ut movendis castris pluribusque adeundis locis commodiore re frumentaria uteretur , simulque in itinere ut aliquam occasionem dimicandi nancisceretur et insolitum ad laborem Pompei exercitum cotidianis itineribus defatigaret . <end>$$<start> These matters being settled , when the signal for marching was given , and the tents struck , it was observed that shortly before , contrary to his daily practice , Pompey's army had advanced further than usual from his intrenchments , so that it appeared possible to come to an action on equal ground . <end>
<start> His constitutis rebus , signo iam profectionis dato tabernaculisque detensis animadversum est paulo ante extra cotidianam consuetudinem longius a vallo esse aciem Pompei progressam , ut non iniquo loco posse dimicari videretur . <end>$$<start> Then Caesar addressed himself to his soldiers , when they were at the gates of the camp , ready to march out We must defer , says he , our march at present , and set our thoughts on battle , which has been our constant wish ; let us then meet the foe with resolute souls . <end>
<start> Pompeius quoque , ut postea cognitum est , suorum omnium hortatu statuerat proelio decertare . <end>$$<start> Pompey also , as was afterward known , at the unanimous solicitation of his friends , had determined to try the fate of a battle . <end>
<start> Namque etiam in consilio superioribus diebus dixerat , priusquam concurrerent acies , fore uti exercitus Caesaris pelleretur . <end>$$<start> For he had even declared in council a few days before that , before the battalions came to battle , Caesar's army would be put to the rout . <end>
<start> Id cum essent plerique admirati , scio me , inquit , paene incredibilem rem polliceri ; sed rationem consilii mei accipite , quo firmiore animo in proelium prodeatis . <end>$$<start> When most people expressed their surprise at it , I know , says he , that I promise a thing almost incredible ; but hear the plan on which I proceed , that you may march to battle with more confidence and resolution . <end>
<start> Persuasi equitibus nostris (idque mihi facturos confirmaverunt) , ut , cum propius sit accessum , dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto aggrederentur et circumventa ab tergo acie prius perturbatum exercitum pellerent , quam a nobis telum in hostem iaceretur . <end>$$<start> I have persuaded our cavalry , and they have engaged to execute it , as soon as the two armies have met , to attack Caesar's right wing on the flank , and inclosing their army on the rear , throw them into disorder , and put them to the rout , before we shall throw a weapon against the enemy . <end>
<start> Ita sine periculo legionum et paene sine vulnere bellum conficiemus . <end>$$<start> By this means we shall put an end to the war , without endangering the legions , and almost without a blow . <end>
<start> Id autem difficile non est , cum tantum equitatu valeamus . <end>$$<start> Nor is this a difficult matter , as we far outnumber them in cavalry . <end>
<start> Simul denuntiavit , ut essent animo parati in posterum et , quoniam fieret dimicandi potestas , ut saepe rogitavissent , ne suam neu reliquorum opinionem fallerent . <end>$$<start> At the same time he gave them notice to be ready for battle on the day following , and since the opportunity which they had so often wished for was now arrived , not to disappoint the opinion generally entertained of their experience and valor . <end>
<start> Hunc Labienus excepit et , cum Caesaris copias despiceret , Pompei consilium summis laudibus efferret , noli , inquit , existimare , Pompei , hunc esse exercitum , qui Galliam Germaniamque devicerit . <end>$$<start> After him Labienus spoke , as well to express his contempt of Caesar's forces , as to extol Pompey's scheme with the highest encomiums . <end>
<start> Omnibus interfui proeliis neque temere incognitam rem pronuntio Perexigua pars illius exercitus superest ; magna pars deperiit , quod accidere tot proeliss fuit necesse , multos autumni pestilentia in Italia consumpsit , multi domum discesserunt , multi sunt relicti in continenti . <end>$$<start> Think not , Pompey , says he , that this is the army which conquered Gaul and Germany ; I was present at all those battles , and do not speak at random on a subject to which I am a stranger : a very small part of that army now remains , great numbers lost their lives , as must necessarily happen in so many battles , many fell victims to the autumnal pestilence in Italy , many returned home , and many were left behind on the continent . <end>
<start> An non audistis ex eis , qui per causam valetudinis remanserunt , cohortes esse Brundisi factas ? Hae copiae , quas videtis , ex dilectibus horum annorum in citeriore Gallia sunt refectae , et plerique sunt ex coloniis Transpadanis . <end>$$<start> Have you not heard that the cohorts at Brundusium are composed of invalids ? The forces which you now behold , have been recruited by levies lately made in Hither Spain , and the greater part from the colonies beyond the Po ; moreover , the flower of the forces perished in the two engagements at Dyrrachium . <end>
<start> Ac tamen quod fuit roboris duobus proeliis Dyrrachinis interiit Hace cum dixisset , iuravit se nisi victorem in castra non reversurum reliquosque , ut idem facerent , hortatus est . <end>$$<start> Having so said , he took an oath , never to return to his camp unless victorious ; and he encouraged the rest to do the like . <end>
<start> Hoc laudans Pompeius idem iuravit ; nec vero ex reliquis fuit quisquam , qui iurare dubitaret . <end>$$<start> Pompey applauded his proposal , and took the same oath ; nor did any person present hesitate to take it . <end>
<start> Haec cum facta sunt in consilio , magna spe et laetitia omnium discessum est ; ac iam animo victoriam praecipiebant , quod de re tanta et a tam perito imperatore nihil frustra confirmari videbatur . <end>$$<start> After this had passed in the council they broke up full of hopes and joy , and in imagination anticipated victory ; because they thought that in a matter of such importance , no groundless assertion could be made by a general of such experience . <end>
<start> Caesar , cum Pompei castris appropinquasset , ad hunc modum aciem eius instructam animadvertit Erant in sinistro cornu legiones duae traditae a Caesare initio dissensionis ex senatusconusulto ; quarum una prima , altera tertia appellabatur . <end>$$<start> When Caesar had approached near Pompey's camp , he observed that his army was drawn up in the following manner : On the left wing were the two legions , delivered over by Caesar at the beginning of the disputes in compliance with the senate's decree , one of which was called the first , the other the third . <end>
<start> In eo loco ipse erat Pompeius . <end>$$<start> Here Pompey commanded in person . <end>
<start> Mediam aciem Scipio cum legionibus Syriacis tenebat . <end>$$<start> Scipio with the Syrian legions commanded the center . <end>
<start> Ciliciensis legio coniuncta cum cohortibus Hispanis , quas traductas ab Afranio docuimus , in dextro cornu erant collocatae . <end>$$<start> The Cilician legion in conjunction with the Spanish cohorts , which we said were brought over by Afranius , were disposed on the right wing . <end>
<start> Has firmissimas se habere Pompeius existimabat . <end>$$<start> These Pompey considered his steadiest troops . <end>
<start> Reliquas inter aciem mediam cornuaque interiecerat numeroque cohortes CX expleverat . <end>$$<start> The rest he had interspersed between the center and the wing , and he had a hundred and ten complete cohorts ; these amounted to forty-five thousand men . <end>
<start> Haec erant milia XLV , evocatorum circiter duo , quae ex beneficiariis superiorum exercituum ad eum convenerant ; quae tot acie disperserat . <end>$$<start> He had besides two cohorts of volunteers , who having received favors from him in former wars , flocked to his standard : these were dispersed through his whole army . <end>
<start> Reliquas cohortes VII castris propinquisque castellis praesidio disposuerat . <end>$$<start> The seven remaining cohorts he had disposed to protect his camp , and the neighboring forts . <end>
<start> Dextrum cornu eius rivus quidam impeditis ripis muniebat ; quam ob causam cunctum equitatum , sagittarios funditoresque omnes sinistro cornu obiecerat . <end>$$<start> His right wing was secured by a river with steep banks ; for which reason he placed all his cavalry , archers , and slingers , on his left wing . <end>
<start> Caesar superius institutum servans decimam legionem in dextro cornu , nonam in sinistro collocaverat , tametsi erat Dyrrachinis proeliis vehementer attenuata , et huic sic adiunxit octavam , ut paene unam ex duabus efficeret , atque alteram alteri praesidio esse iusserat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , observing his former custom , had placed the tenth legion on the right , the ninth on the left , although it was very much weakened by the battles at Dyrrachium . <end>
<start> Cohortes in acie LXXX constitutas habebat , quae summa erat milium XXII ; cohortes VII castris praesidlo reliquerat . <end>$$<start> He placed the eighth legion so close to the ninth , as to almost make one of the two , and ordered them to support one another . <end>
<start> Sinistro cornu Antonium , dextro Publius Sullam , media acie Gnaeus Domitium praeposuerat . <end>$$<start> He drew up on the field eighty cohorts , making a total of twenty-two thousand men . <end>
<start> Ipse contra Pompeium constitit . <end>$$<start> He left two cohorts to guard the camp . <end>
<start> Simul his rebus animadversis , quas demonstravimus , timens , ne a multitudine equitum dextrum cornu circumveniretur , celeriter ex tertia acie singulas cohortes detraxit atque ex his quartam instituit equitatuique opposuit et , quid fieri vellet , ostendit monuitque eius diei victoriam in earum cohortium virtute constare . <end>$$<start> He gave the command of the left wing to Antonius , of the right to P Sulla , and of the center to Cn Domitius : he himself took his post opposite Pompey At the same time , fearing , from the disposition of the enemy which we have previously mentioned , lest his right wing might be surrounded by their numerous cavalry , he rapidly drafted a single cohort from each of the legions composing the third line , formed of them a fourth line , and opposed them to Pompey's cavalry , and , acquainting them with his wishes , admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage . <end>
<start> Simul tertiae aciei totique exercitui imperavit , ne iniussu suo concurreret : se , cum id fieri vellet , vexillo signum daturum . <end>$$<start> At the same time he ordered the third line , and the entire army not to charge without his command : that he would give the signal whenever he wished them to do so . <end>
<start> Exercitum cum militari more ad pugnam cohortaretur suaque in eum perpetui temporis officia praedicaret , imprimis commemoravit : testibus se militibus uti posse , quanto studio pacem petisset ; quae per Vatinium in colloquiis , quae per Aulum Clodium eum Scipione egisset , quibus modis ad Oricum cum Libone de mittendis legatis contendisset . <end>$$<start> When he was exhorting his army to battle , according to the military custom , and spoke to them of the favors that they had constantly received from him , he took especial care to remind them that he could call his soldiers to witness the earnestness with which he had sought peace , the efforts that he had made by Vatinius to gain a conference with Labienus , and likewise by Claudius to treat with Scipio , in what manner he had exerted himself at Oricum , to gain permission from Libo to send embassadors ; that he had been always reluctant to shed the blood of his soldiers , and did not wish to deprive the republic of one or other of her armies . <end>
<start> Erat Gaius Crastinus evocatus in exercitu Caesaris , qui superiore anno apud eum primum pilum in legione X duxerat , vir singulari virtute . <end>$$<start> There was in Caesar's army , a volunteer of the name of Crastinus , who the year before had been first centurion of the tenth legion , a man of pre-eminent bravery . <end>
<start> Hic signo dato , sequimini me , inquit , manipulares mei qui fuistis , et vestro imperatori quam constituistis operam date Unum hoc proelium superest ; quo confecto et ille suam dignitatem et nos nostram libertatem recuperabimus . <end>$$<start> He , when the signal was given , says , Follow me , my old comrades , and display such exertions in behalf of your general as you have determined to do : this is our last battle , and when it shall be won , he will recover his dignity , and we our liberty . <end>
<start> Simul respiciens Caesarem , faciam , inquit , hodie , imperator , ut aut vivo mihi aut mortuo gratias agas . <end>$$<start> At the same time he looked back to Caesar , and said , General , I will act in such a manner to-day , that you will feel grateful to me living or dead . <end>
<start> Haec cum dixisset , primus ex dextro cornu procucurrit , atque eum electi milites circiter CXX voluntarii eiusdem cohortis sunt prosecuti . <end>$$<start> After uttering these words he charged first on the right wing , and about one hundred and twenty chosen volunteers of the same century followed . <end>
<start> Quod nobis quidem nulla ratione factum a Pompeio videtur , propterea quod est quaedam animi incitatio atque alacritas naturaliter innata omnibus , quae studio pugnae incenditur ; hanc non reprimere , sed augere imperatores debent ; neque frustra antiquitus institutum est , ut signa undique concinerent clamoremque universi tollerent ; quibus rebus et hostes terreri et suos incitari existimaverunt . <end>$$<start> This a general should endeavor not to repress , but to increase ; nor was it a vain institution of our ancestors , that the trumpets should sound on all sides , and a general shout be raised ; by which they imagined that the enemy were struck with terror , and their own army inspired with courage . <end>
<start> Sed nostri milites dato signo cum infestis pilis procucurrissent atque animum advertissent non concurri a Pompeianis , usu periti ac superioribus pugnis exercitati sua sponte cursum represserunt et ad medium fere spatium constiterunt , ne consumptis viribus appropinquarent , parvoque intermisso temporis spatio ac rursus renovato cursu pila miserunt celeriterque , ut erat praeceptum a Caesare , gladios strinxerunt . <end>$$<start> But our men , when the signal was given , rushed forward with their javelins ready to be launched , but perceiving that Pompey's men did not run to meet their charge , having acquired experience by custom , and being practiced in former battles , they of their own accord repressed their speed , and halted almost midway ; that they might not come up with the enemy when their strength was exhausted , and after a short respite they again renewed their course , and threw their javelins , and instantly drew their swords , as Caesar had ordered them . <end>
<start> Neque vero Pompeiani huic rei defuerunt Nam et tela missa exceperunt et impetum legionum tulerunt et ordines suos servarunt pilisque missis ad gladios redierunt . <end>$$<start> Nor did Pompey's men fail in this crisis , for they received our javelins , stood our charge , and maintained their ranks ; and having launched their javelins , had recourse to their swords . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore equites ab sinistro Pompei cornu , ut erat imperatum , universi procucurrerunt , omnisque multitudo sagittariorum se profudit . <end>$$<start> At the same time Pompey's horse , according to their orders , rushed out at once from his left wing , and his whole host of archers poured after them . <end>
<start> Quorum impetum noster equitatus non tulit , sed paulatim loco motus cessit , equitesque Pompei hoc acrius instare et se turmatim explicare aciemque nostram a latere aperto circumire coeperunt . <end>$$<start> Our cavalry did not withstand their charge : but gave ground a little , upon which Pompey's horse pressed them more vigorously , and began to file off in troops , and flank our army . <end>
<start> Quod ubi Caesar animadvertit , quartae aciei , quam instituerat sex cohortium , dedit signum . <end>$$<start> When Caesar perceived this , he gave the signal to his fourth line , which he had formed of the six cohorts . <end>
<start> Illi celeriter procucurrerunt infestisque signis tanta vi in Pompei equites impetum fecerunt , ut eorum nemo consisteret , omnesque conversi non solum loco excederent , sed protinus incitati fuga montes altissimos peterent . <end>$$<start> They instantly rushed forward and charged Pompey's horse with such fury , that not a man of them stood ; but all wheeling about , not only quitted their post , but galloped forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountains . <end>
<start> Quibus submotis omnes sagittarii funditoresque destituti inermes sine praesidio interfecti sunt . <end>$$<start> By their retreat the archers and slingers , being left destitute and defenseless , were all cut to pieces . <end>
<start> Eodem impetu cohortes sinistrum cornu pugnantibus etiam tum ac resistentibus in acie Pompeianis circumierunt eosque a tergo sunt adorti . <end>$$<start> The cohorts , pursuing their success , wheeled about upon Pompey's left wing , while his infantry still continued to make battle , and attacked them in the rear . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore tertiam aciem Caesar , quae quieta fuerat et se ad id tempus loco tenuerat , procurrere iussit . <end>$$<start> At the same time Caesar ordered his third line to advance , which till then had not been engaged , but had kept their post . <end>
<start> Sed Pompeius , ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit atque eam partem , cui maxime confidebat , perterritam animadvertit , aliis quoque diffisus acie excessit protinusque se in castra equo contulit et eis centurionibus , quos in statione ad praetoriam portam posuerat , clare , ut milites exaudirent , tuemini , inquit , castra et defendite diligenter , si quid durius acciderit . <end>$$<start> For by them the cavalry were routed ; by them the archers and slingers were cut to pieces ; by them the left wing of Pompey's army was surrounded , and obliged to be the first to flee . <end>
<start> Caesar Pompeianis ex fuga intra vallum compulsis nullum spatium perterritis dari oportere existimans milites cohortatus est , ut beneficio fortunae uterentur castraque oppugnarent . <end>$$<start> Caesar having forced the Pompeians to flee into their intrenchment , and thinking that he ought not to allow them any respite to recover from their fright , exhorted his soldiers to take advantage of fortune's kindness , and to attack the camp . <end>
<start> Qui , etsi magno aestu fatigati (nam ad meridiem res erat perducta) , tamen ad omnem laborem animo parati imperio paruerunt . <end>$$<start> Though they were fatigued by the intense heat , for the battle had continued till mid-day , yet , being prepared to undergo any labor , they cheerfully obeyed his command . <end>
<start> Castra a cohortibus , quae ibi praesidio erant relictae , industrie defendebantur , multo etiam acrius a Thracibus barbarisque auxiliis . <end>$$<start> The camp was bravely defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard it , but with much more spirit by the Thracians and foreign auxiliaries . <end>
<start> Nam qui acie refugerant milites , et animo perterriti et lassitudine confecti , missis plerique armis signisque militaribus , magis de reliqua fuga quam de castrorum defensione cogitabant . <end>$$<start> For the soldiers who had fled for refuge to it from the field of battle , affrighted and exhausted by fatigue , having thrown away their arms and military standards , had their thoughts more engaged on their further escape than on the defense of the camp . <end>
<start> Neque vero diutius , qui in vallo constiterant , multitudinem telorum sustinere potuerunt , sed confecti vulneribus locum reliquerunt , protinusque omnes ducibus usi centurionibus tribunisque militum in altissimos montes , qui ad castra pertinebant , confugerunt . <end>$$<start> Nor could the troops who were posted on the battlements , long withstand the immense number of our darts , but fainting under their wounds , quitted the place , and under the conduct of their centurions and tribunes , fled , without stopping , to the high mountains which joined the camp . <end>
<start> In castris Pompei videre licuit trichilas structas , magnum argenti pondus eitum , recentibus caespitibus tabernacula constrata , Lucii etiam Lentuli et nonnullorum tabernacula protecta edera , multaque praeterea , quae nimiam luxuriam et victoriae fiduciam designarent , ut facile existimari posset nihil eos de eventu eius diei timuisse , qui non necessarias conquirerent voluptates . <end>$$<start> In Pompey's camp you might see arbors in which tables were laid , a large quantity of plate set out , the floors of the tents covered with fresh sods , the tents of Lucius Lentulus and others shaded with ivy , and many other things which were proofs of excessive luxury , and a confidence of victory , so that it might readily be inferred that they had no apprehensions of the issue of the day , as they indulged themselves in unnecessary pleasures , and yet upbraided with luxury Caesar's army , distressed and suffering troops , who had always been in want of common necessaries . <end>
<start> At hi miserrimo ac patientissimo exercitui Caesaris luxuriam obiciebant , cui semper omnia ad necessarium usum defuissent . <end>$$<start> Pompey , as soon as our men had forced the trenches , mounting his horse , and stripping off his general's habit , went hastily out of the back gate of the camp , and galloped with all speed to Larissa . <end>
<start> Pompeius , iam cum intra vallum nostri versarentur , equum nactus , detractis insignibus imperatoris , decumana porta se ex castris eiecit protinusque equo citato Larisam contendit Neque ibi constitit , sed eadem celeritate , paucos suos ex fuga nactus , nocturno itinere non intermisso , comitatu equitum XXX ad mare pervenit navemque frumentariam conscendit , saepe , ut dicebatur , querens tantum se opinionem fefellisse , ut , a quo genere hominum victoriam sperasset , ab eo initio fugae facto paene proditus videretur . <end>$$<start> Nor did he stop there , but with the same dispatch , collecting a few of his flying troops , and halting neither day nor night , he arrived at the seaside , attended by only thirty horse , and went on board a victualing barque , often complaining , as we have been told , that he had been so deceived in his expectation , that he was almost persuaded that he had been betrayed by those from whom he had expected victory , as they began the fight . <end>
<start> Caesar castris potitus a militibus contendit , ne in praeda occupati reliqui negotii gerendi facultatem dimitterent . <end>$$<start> Caesar having possessed himself of Pompey's camp , urged his soldiers not to be too intent on plunder , and lose the opportunity of completing their conquest . <end>
<start> Qua re impetrata montem opere circummunire instituit . <end>$$<start> Having obtained their consent , he began to draw lines round the mountain . <end>
<start> Pompeiani , quod is mons erat sine aqua , diffisi ei loco relicto monte universi iugis eius Larisam versus se recipere coeperunt Qua re animadversa Caesar copias suas divisit partemque legionum in castris Pompei remanere iussit , partem in sua castra remisit , IIII secum legiones duxit commodioreque itinere Pompeianis occurrere coepit et progressus milia passuum VI aciem instruxit . <end>$$<start> The Pompeians distrusting the position , as there was no water on the mountain , abandoned it , and all began to retreat toward Larissa ; which Caesar perceiving , divided his troops , and ordering part of his legions to remain in Pompey's camp , sent back a part to his own camp , and taking four legions with him , went by a shorter road to intercept the enemy : and having marched six miles , drew up his army . <end>
<start> Qua re animadversa Pompeiani in quodam monte constiterunt . <end>$$<start> But the Pompeians observing this , took post on a mountain , whose foot was washed by a river . <end>
<start> Hunc montem flumen subluebat Caesar milites cohortatus , etsi totius diei continenti labore erant confecti noxque iam suberat , tamen munitione flumen a monte seclusit , ne noctu aquari Pompeiani possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar having encouraged his troops , though they were greatly exhausted by incessant labor the whole day , and night was now approaching , by throwing up works cut off the communication between the river and the mountain , that the enemy might not get water in the night . <end>
<start> Quo perfecto opere illi de deditione missis legatis agere coeperunt . <end>$$<start> As soon as the work was finished , they sent embassadors to treat about a capitulation . <end>
<start> Pauci ordinis senatorii , qui se cum eis coniunxerant , nocte fuga salutem petiverunt . <end>$$<start> A few senators who had espoused that party , made their escape by night . <end>
<start> Caesar prima luce omnes eos , qui in monte consederant , ex superioribus locis in planiciem descendere atque arma proicere iussit . <end>$$<start> At break of day , Caesar ordered all those who had taken post on the mountain , to come down from the higher grounds into the plain , and pile their arms . <end>
<start> Quod ubi sine recusatione fecerunt passisque palmis proiecti ad terram flentes ab eo salutem petiverunt , consolatus consurgere iussit et pauca apud eos de lenitate sua locutus , quo minore essent timore , omnes conservavit militibusque suis commendavit , ne qui eorum violaretur , neu quid sui desiderarent . <end>$$<start> When they did this without refusal , and with outstretched arms , prostrating themselves on the ground , with tears , implored his mercy : he comforted them and bade them rise , and having spoken a few words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears , he pardoned them all , and gave orders to his soldiers , that no injury should be done to them , and nothing taken from them . <end>
<start> Hac adhibita diligentia ex castris sibi legiones alias occurrere et eas , quas secum duxerat , in vicem requiescere atque in castra reverti iussit eodemque die Larisam pervenit . <end>$$<start> Having used this diligence , he ordered the legions in his camp to come and meet him , and those which were with him to take their turn of rest , and go back to the camp : and the same day went to Larissa  . <end>
<start> In eo proelio non amplius CC milites desideravit , sed centuriones , fortes viros , circiter XXX amisit . <end>$$<start> In that battle , no more than two hundred privates were missing , but Caesar lost about thirty centurions , valiant officers . <end>
<start> Lucius Domitius ex castris in montem refugiens , cum vires eum lassitudine defecissent , ab equitibus est interfectus . <end>$$<start> Lucius Domitius , fleeing from the camp to the mountains , his strength being exhausted by fatigue , was killed by the horse . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore D Laelius cum classe ad Brundisium venit eademque ratione , qua factum a Libone antea demonstravimus , insulam obiectam portui Brundisino tenuit . <end>$$<start> About this time , Decimus Laelius arrived with his fleet at Brundusium and in the same manner , as Libo had done before , possessed himself of an island opposite the harbor of Brundusium . <end>
<start> Similiter Vatinius , qui Brundisio praeerat , tectis instructisque scaphis elicuit naves Laelianas atque ex his longius productam unam qninqueremem et minores duas in angustiis portus cepit itemque per equites dispositos aqua prohibere classiarios instituit . <end>$$<start> In like manner , Valinius , who was then governor of Brundusium , with a few decked barks , endeavored to entice Laelius's fleet , and took one five-banked galley and two smaller vessels that had ventured further than the rest into a narrow part of the harbor : and likewise disposing the horse along the shore , strove to prevent the enemy from procuring fresh water . <end>
<start> Sed Laelius tempore anni commodiore usus ad navigandum onerariis navibus Corcyra Dyrrachioque aquam suis supportabat , neque a proposito deterrebatur neque ante proelium in Thessalia factum cognitum aut ignominia amissarum navium aut necessariarum rerum inopia ex portu insulaque expelli potuit . <end>$$<start> But Laelius having chosen a more convenient season of the year for his expedition , supplied himself with water brought in transports from Corcyra and Dyrrachium , and was not deterred from his purpose ; and till he had received advice of the battle in Thessaly , he could not be forced either by the disgrace of losing his ships , or by the want of necessaries , to quit the port and islands . <end>
<start> Tantusque eo facto timor incessit , ut , cum esset legio praesidio Messanae , vix oppidum defenderetur , et nisi eo ipso tempore quidam nuntii de Caesaris victoria per dispositos equites essent allati , existimabant plerique futurum fuisse , uti amitteretur . <end>$$<start> The wind being favorable , he sent into the port about forty ships provided with combustibles , and the flame catching on both sides , five ships were burned to ashes . <end>
<start> Sed opportunissime nuntiis allatis oppidum est defensum ; Cassiusque ad Sulpicianam inde classem profectus est Vibonem , applicatisque nostris ad terram navibus pari atque antea ratione Cassius secundum nactus ventum onerarias naves praeparatas ad incendium immisit , et flamma ab utroque cornu comprensa naves sunt combustae quinque . <end>$$<start> And when the fire began to spread wider by the violence of the wind , the soldiers of the veteran legions , who had been left to guard the fleet , being considered as invalids , could not endure the disgrace , but of themselves went on board the ships and weighed anchor , and having attacked Cassius's fleet , captured two five-banked galleys , in one of which was Cassius himself ; but he made his escape by taking to a boat . <end>
<start> Neque multo post de proelio facto in Thessalia cognitum est , ut ipsis Pompeianis fides fieret ; nam ante id tempus fingi a legatis amicisque Caesaris arbitrabantur . <end>$$<start> Intelligence was shortly after received of the action in Thessaly , so well authenticated , that the Pompeians themselves gave credit to it ; for they had hitherto believed it a fiction of Caesar's lieutenants and friends . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis ex his locis Cassius cum classe discessit . <end>$$<start> Upon which intelligence Cassius departed with his fleet from that coast . <end>
<start> Caesar omnibus rebus relictis persequendum sibi Pompeium existimavit , quascumque in partes se ex fuga recepisset , ne rursus copias comparare alias et bellum renovare posset , et quantumcumque itineris equitatu efficere poterat , cotidie progrediebatur legionemque unam minoribus itineribus subsequi iussit . <end>$$<start> Caesar thought he ought to postpone all business and pursue Pompey , whithersoever he should retreat ; that he might not be able to provide fresh forces , and renew the war ; he therefore marched on every day , as far as his cavalry were able to advance , and ordered one legion to follow him by shorter journeys . <end>
<start> Idem hoc Lucius Lentulo , qui superiore anno consul fuerat , et Publius Lentulo consulari ac nonnullis aliis acciderat Rhodi ; qui cum ex fuga Pompeium sequerentur atque in insulam venissent , oppido ac portu recepti non erant missisque ad eos nuntiis , ut ex his locis discederent contra voluntatem suam naves solverant . <end>$$<start> There he is informed that , by the consent of all the inhabitants of Antioch and Roman citizens who traded there , the castle had been seized to shut him out of the town ; and that messengers had been dispatched to all those who were reported to have taken refuge in the neighboring states , that they should not come to Antioch ; that if they did , that it would be attended with imminent danger to their lives . <end>
<start> Quibus cognitis rebus Pompeius deposito adeundae Syriae consilio pecunia societatis sublata et a quibusdam privatis sumpta et aeris magno pondere ad militarem usum in naves imposito duobusque milibus hominum armatis , partim quos ex familiis societatum delegerat , partim a negotiatoribus coegerat , quosque ex suis quisque ad hanc rem idoneos existimabat , Pelusium pervenit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , being informed of these proceedings , laid aside his design of going to Syria , and having taken the public money from the farmers of the revenue , and borrowed more from some private friends , and having put on board his ships a large quantity of brass for military purposes , and two thousand armed men , whom he partly selected from the slaves of the tax farmers , and partly collected from the merchants , and such persons as each of his friends thought fit on this occasion , he sailed for Pelusium . <end>
<start> Ibi casu rex erat Ptolomaeus , puer aetate , magnis copiis cum sorore Cleopatra bellum gerens , quam paucis ante mensibus per suos propinquos atque amicos regno expulerat ; castraque Cleopatrae non longo spatio ab eius castris distabant . <end>$$<start> It happened that king Ptolemy , a minor , was there with a considerable army , engaged in war with his sister Cleopatra , whom a few months before , by the assistance of his relations and friends , he had expelled from the kingdom ; and her camp lay at a small distance from his . <end>
<start> Ad eum Pompeius misit , ut pro hospitio atque amicitia patris Alexandria reciperetur atque illius opibus in calamitate tegeretur . <end>$$<start> To him Pompey applied to be permitted to take refuge in Alexandria , and to be protected in his calamity by his powerful assistance , in consideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between his father and him . <end>
<start> Sed qui ab eo missi erant , confecto legationis officio liberius cum militibus regis colloqui coeperunt eosque hortari , ut suum officium Pompeio praestarent , neve eius fortunam despicerent . <end>$$<start> But Pompey's deputies having executed their commission , began to converse with less restraint with the king's troops , and to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey , and not to think meanly of his bad fortune . <end>
<start> In hoc erant numero complures Pompei milites , quos ex eius exercitu acceptos in Syria Gabinius Alexandriam traduxerat belloque confecto apud Ptolomaeum , patrem pueri , reliquerat . <end>$$<start> In Ptolemy's army were several of Pompey's soldiers , of whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria , and had brought them over to Alexandria , and at the conclusion of the war had left with Ptolemy the father of the young king . <end>
<start> His tum cognitis rebus amici regis , qui propter aetatem eius in procuratione erant regni , sive timore adducti , ut postea praedicabant , sollicitato exercitu regio ne Pompeius Alexandriam Aegyptumque occuparet , sive despecta eius fortuna , ut plerumque in calamitate ex amicis inimici exsistunt , his , qui erant ab eo missi , palam liberaliter responderunt eumque ad regem venire iusserunt ; ipsi clam consilio inito Achillam , praefectum regium , singulari hominem audacia , et Lucius Septimium , tribunum militum , ad interficiendum Pompeium miserunt . <end>$$<start> The king's friends , who were regents of the kingdom during the minority , being informed of these things , either induced by fear , as they afterward declared , lest Pompey should corrupt the king's army , and seize on Alexandria and Egypt ; or despising his bad fortune , as in adversity friends commonly change to enemies , in public gave a favorable answer to his deputies , and desired him to come to the king ; but secretly laid a plot against him , and dispatched Achillas , captain of the king's guards , a man of singular boldness , and Lucius Septimius a military tribune to assassinate him . <end>
<start> Ab his liberaliter ipse appellatus et quadam notitia Septimii productus , quod bello praedonum apud eum ordinem duxerat , naviculam parvulam conscendit cum paucis suis : ibi ab Achilla et Septimio interficitur . <end>$$<start> Being kindly addressed by them , and deluded by an acquaintance with Septimius , because in the war with the pirates the latter had commanded a company under him , he embarked in a small boat with a few attendants , and was there murdered by Achillas and Septimius . <end>
<start> Item Lucius Lentulus comprehenditur ab rege et in custodia necatur . <end>$$<start> In like manner , Lucius Lentulus was seized by the king's order , and put to death in prison . <end>
<start> Caesar , cum in Asiam venisset , reperiebat Titus Ampium conatum esse pecunias tollere Epheso ex fano Dianae eiusque rei causa senatores omnes ex provincia evocasse , ut his testibus in summa pecuniae uteretur , sed interpellatum adventu Caesaris profugisse . <end>$$<start> When Caesar arrived in Asia , he found that Titus Ampius had attempted to remove the money from the temple of Diana at Ephesus ; and for this purpose had convened all the senators in the province that he might have them to attest the sum , but was interrupted by Caesar's arrival , and had made his escape . <end>
<start> Eodemque die Antiochiae in Syria bis tantus exercitus clamor et signorum sonus exauditus est , ut in muris armata civitas discurreret Hoc idem Ptolomaide accidit Pergami in occultis ac reconditis templi , quo praeter sacerdotes adire fas non est , quae Graeci 'adyta' appellant , tympana sonuerunt . <end>$$<start> It was also remarked at Elis , in the temple of Minerva , upon calculating and enumerating the days , that on the very day on which Caesar had gained his battle , the image of Victory which was placed before Minerva , and faced her statue , turned about toward the portal and entrance of the temple ; and the same day , at Antioch in Syria , such a shout of an army and sound of trumpets was twice heard that the citizens ran in arms to the walls . <end>
<start> Caesar paucos dies in Asia moratus , cum audisset Pompeium Cypri visum , coniectans eum in Aegyptum iter habere propter necessitudines regni reliquasque eius loci opportunitates cum legione una , quam se ex Thessalia sequi iusserat , et altera , quam ex Achaia a Quintus Fufio legato evocaverat , equitibusque DCCC et navibus longis Rhodiis X et Asiaticis paucis Alexandriam pervenit . <end>$$<start> After a few days' delay in Asia , Caesar , having heard that Pompey had been seen in Cyprus , and conjecturing that he had directed his course into Egypt , on account of his connection with that kingdom , set out for Alexandria with two legions (one of which he ordered to follow him from Thessaly , the other he called in from Achaia , from Fufius , the lieutenant general) , and with eight hundred horse , ten ships of war from Rhodes , and a few from Asia . <end>
<start> In his erant legionibus hominum milia tria CC ; reliqui vulneribus ex proeliis et labore ac magnitudine itineris confecti consequi non potuerant . <end>$$<start> These legions amounted but to three thousand two hundred men ; the rest , disabled by wounds received in various battles , by fatigue and the length of their march , could not follow him . <end>
<start> Sed Caesar confisus fama rerum gestarum infirmis auxiliis proficisci non dubitaverat , aeque omnem sibi locum tutum fore existimans . <end>$$<start> But Caesar , relying on the fame of his exploits , did not hesitate to set forward with a feeble force , and thought that he would be secure in any place . <end>
<start> Alexandriae de Pompei morte cognoscit atque ibi primum e nave egrediens clamorem militum audit , quos rex in oppido praesidii causa reliquerat , et concursum ad se fieri videt , quod fasces anteferrentur . <end>$$<start> At Alexandria he was informed of the death of Pompey : and at his landing there , heard a cry among the soldiers whom the king had left to garrison the town , and saw a crowd gathering toward him , because the fasces were carried before him ; for this the whole multitude thought an infringement of the king's dignity . <end>
<start> In hoc omnis multitudo maiestatem regiam minui praedicabat Hoc sedato tumultu crebrae continuis diebus ex concursu multitudinis concitationes fiebant , compluresque milites huius urbis omnibus partibus interficiebantur . <end>$$<start> Though this tumult was appeased , frequent disturbances were raised for several days successively , by crowds of the populace , and a great many of his soldiers were killed in all parts of the city . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus animadversis legiones sibi alias ex Asia adduci iussit , quas ex Pompeianis militibus confecerat Ipse enim necessario etesiis tenebatur , qui navigantibus Alexandria flant adversissimi venti . <end>$$<start> Having observed this , he ordered other legions to be brought to him from Asia , which he had made up out of Pompey's soldiers ; for he was himself detained against his will , by the etesian winds , which are totally unfavorable to persons on a voyage from Alexandria . <end>
<start> Interim controversias regum ad populum Romanum et ad se , quod esset consul , pertinere existimans atque eo magis officio suo convenire , quod superiore consulatu cum patre Ptolomaeo et lege et senatusconsulto societas erat facta , ostendit sibi placere regem Ptolomaeum atque eius sororem Cleopatram exercitus , quos haberent , dimittere et de controversiis iure apud se potius quam inter se armis disceptare . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , considering that the disputes of the princes belonged to the jurisdiction of the Roman people , and of him as consul , and that it was a duty more incumbent on him , as in his former consulate a league had been made with Ptolemy the late king , under sanction both of a law and a decree of the senate , he signified that it was his pleasure that king Ptolemy , and his sister Cleopatra , should disband their armies , and decide their disputes in his presence by justice , rather than by the sword . <end>
<start> Erat in procuratione regni propter aetatem pueri nutricius eius , eunuchus nomine Pothinus . <end>$$<start> A eunuch named Pothinus , the boy's tutor , was regent of the kingdom on account of his youthfulness . <end>
<start> Is primum inter suos queri atque indignari coepit regem ad causam dicendam evocari ; deinde adiutores quosdam consilii sui nactus ex regis amicis exercitum a Pelusio clam Alexandriam evocavit atque eundem Achillam , cuius supra meminimus , omnibus copiis praefecit . <end>$$<start> He at first began to complain among his friends , and to express his indignation , that the king should be summoned to plead his cause : but afterward , having prevailed on some of those whom he had made acquainted with his views to join him he secretly called the army away from Pelusium to Alexandria , and appointed Achillas , already spoken of , commander-in-chief of the forces . <end>
<start> Hunc incitatum suis et regis inflatum pollicitationibus , quae fieri vellet , litteris nuntiisque edocuit . <end>$$<start> Him he encouraged and animated by promises both in his own and the king's name , and instructed him both by letters and messages how he should act . <end>
<start> In testamento Ptolomaei patris heredes erant scripti ex duobus filiis maior et ex duabus filiabus ea , quae aetate antecedebat Haec uti fierent , per omnes deos perque foedera , quae Romae fecisset , eodem testamento Ptolomaeus populum Romanum obtestabatur . <end>$$<start> By the will of Ptolemy the father , the elder of his two sons and the more advanced in years of his two daughters were declared his heirs , and for the more effectual performance of his intention , in the same will he conjured the Roman people by all the gods , and by the league which he had entered into at Rome , to see his will executed . <end>
<start> Tabulae testamenti unae per legatos eius Romam erant allatae , ut in aerario ponerentur (hic cum propter publicas occupationes poni non potuissent , apud Pompeium sunt depositae) , alterae eodem exemplo relictae atque obsignatae Alexandriae proferebantur . <end>$$<start> One of the copies of his will was conveyed to Rome by his embassadors to be deposited in the treasury , but the public troubles preventing it , it was lodged with Pompey : another was left sealed up , and kept at Alexandria . <end>
<start> De his rebus cum ageretur apud Caesarem , isque maxime vellet pro communi amico atque arbitro controversias regum componere , subito exercitus regius equitatusque omnis venire Alexandriam nuntiatur . <end>$$<start> While these things were debated before Caesar , and he was very anxious to settle the royal disputes as a common friend and arbitrator ; news was brought on a sudden that the king's army and all his cavalry , were on their march to Alexandria . <end>
<start> Caesaris copiae nequaquam erant tantae , ut eis , extra oppidum si esset dimicandum , confideret . <end>$$<start> His only resource was to keep within the town in the most convenient places , and get information of Achillas's designs . <end>
<start> Milites tamen omnes in armis esse iussit regemque hortatus est , ut ex suis necessariis , quos haberet maximae auctoritatis , legatos ad Achillam mitteret et , quid esset suae voluntatis , ostenderet . <end>$$<start> Dioscorides and Serapion , the persons sent by him , who had both been embassadors at Rome , and had been in great esteem with Ptolemy the father , went to Achillas . <end>
<start> A quo missi Dioscorides et Serapion , qui ambo legati Romae fuerant magnamque apud patrem Ptolomaeum auctoritatem habuerant , ad Achillam pervenerunt . <end>$$<start> But as soon as they appeared in his presence , without hearing them , or learning the occasion of their coming , he ordered them to be seized and put to death . <end>
<start> Quos ille , cum in conspectum eius venissent , priusquam audiret aut , cuius rei causa missi essent , cognosceret , corripi atque interfici iussit ; quorum alter accepto vulnere occupatus per suos pro occiso sublatus , alter interfectus est . <end>$$<start> One of them , after receiving a wound , was taken up and carried off by his attendants as dead : the other was killed on the spot . <end>
<start> Erant cum Achilla eae copiae , ut neque numero neque genere hominum neque usu rei militaris contemnendae viderentur . <end>$$<start> The forces under Achillas did not seem despicable , either for number , spirit , or military experience ; for he had twenty thousand men under arms . <end>
<start> Milia enim XX in armis habebat Haec constabant ex Gabinianis militibus qui iam in consuetudinem Alexandrinae vitae ac licentiae venerant et nomen disciplinamque populi Romani dedidicerant uxoresque duxerant , ex quibus plerique liberos habebant . <end>$$<start> They consisted partly of Gabinius's soldiers , who were now become habituated to the licentious mode of living at Alexandria , and had forgotten the name and discipline of the Roman people , and had married wives there , by whom the greatest part of them had children . <end>
<start> Huc accedebant collecti ex praedonibus latronibusque Syriae Ciliciaeque provinciae finitimarumque regionum . <end>$$<start> To these was added a collection of highwaymen , and freebooters , from Syria , and the province of Cilicia , and the adjacent countries . <end>
<start> Multi praeterea capitis damnati exulesque convenerant ; figitivis omnibus nostris certus erat Alexandriae receptus certaque vitae condicio , ut dato nomine militum essent numero ; quorum si quis a domino prehenderetur , consensu militum eripiebatur , qui vim suorum , quod in simili culpa versabantur , ipsi pro suo periculo defendebant . <end>$$<start> Besides several convicts and transports had been collected : for at Alexandria all our runaway slaves were sure of finding protection for their persons on the condition that they should give in their names , and enlist as soldiers : and if any of them was apprehended by his master , he was rescued by a crowd of his fellow soldiers , who being involved in the same guilt , repelled , at the hazard of their lives , every violence offered to any of their body . <end>
<start> Hi regum amicos ad mortem deposcere , hi bona locupletum diripere , stipendii augendi causa regis domum obsidere , regno expellere alios , alios arcessere vetere quodam Alexandrini exercitus instituto consuerant . <end>$$<start> These by a prescriptive privilege of the Alexandrian army , used to demand the king's favorites to be put to death , pillage the properties of the rich to increase their pay , invest the king's palace , banish some from the kingdom , and recall others from exile . <end>
<start> Erant praeterea equitum milia duo Inveteraverant hi omnes compluribus Alexandriae bellis ; Ptolomaeum patrem in regnum reduxerant , Bibuli filios duos interfecerant , bella cum Aegyptiis gesserant . <end>$$<start> Besides these , there were two thousand horse , who had acquired the skill of veterans by being in several wars in Alexandria . <end>
<start> His copiis fidens Achillas paucitatemque militum Caesaris despiciens occupabat Alexandriam praeter eam oppidi partem , quam Caesar cum militibus tenebat , primo impetu domum eius irrumpere conatus ; sed Caesar dispositis per vias cohortibus impetum eius sustinuit . <end>$$<start> Full of confidence in his troops , and despising the small number of Caesar's soldiers , Achillas seized Alexandria , except that part of the town which Caesar occupied with his troops . <end>
<start> Itaque tanta esta contentione actum , quanta agi debuit , cum illi celerem in ea re victoriam , hi salutem suam consistere viderent . <end>$$<start> Accordingly that spirit was displayed , which ought to be displayed when the one party saw that a speedy victory depended on the issue , and the other their safety . <end>
<start> Sed rem obtinuit Caesar omnesque eas naves et reliquas , quae erant in navalibus , incendit , quod tam late tueri parva manu non poterat , confestimque ad Pharum navibus milites euit . <end>$$<start> But Caesar gained the day , and set fire to all those ships , and to others which were in the docks , because he could not guard so many places with so small a force ; and immediately he conveyed some troops to the Pharos by his ships . <end>
<start> Pharus est in insula turris magna altitudine , mirificis operibus exstructae ; quae nomen ab insula accepit . <end>$$<start> The Pharos is a tower on an island , of prodigious height , built with amazing works , and takes its name from the island . <end>
<start> In hac sunt insula domicilia Aegyptiorum et vicus oppidi magnitudine ; quaeque ibi naves imprudentia aut tempestate paulum suo cursu decesserunt , has more praedonum diripere consuerunt . <end>$$<start> This island lying over against Alexandria , forms a harbor ; but on the upper side it is connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred paces in length , made by piles sunk in the sea , and by a bridge . <end>
<start> Hoc tum veritus Caesar , hostibus in pugna occupatis , militibus eitis Pharum prehendit atque ibi praesidium posuit . <end>$$<start> And without the consent of those who are masters of the Pharos , no vessels can enter the harbor , on account of its narrowness . <end>
<start> Quibus est rebus effectum , uti tuto frumentum auxiliaque navibus ad eum supportari possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar being greatly alarmed on this account , while the enemy were engaged in battle , landed his soldiers , seized the Pharos , and placed a garrison in it . <end>
<start> Dimisit enim circum omnes propinquas provincias atque inde auxilia evocavit Reliquis oppidi partibus sic est pugnatum , ut aequo proelio discederetur et neutri pellerentur (id efficiebant angustiae loci) , paucisque utrimque interfectis Caesar loca maxime necessaria complexus noctu praemuniit . <end>$$<start> By this means he gained this point , that he could be supplied without danger with corn , and auxiliaries ; for he sent to all the neighboring countries , to demand supplies . <end>
<start> In eo tractu oppidi pars erat regiae exigua , in quam ipse habitandi causa initio erat inductus , et theatrum coniunctum domui quod arcis tenebat locum aditusque habebat ad portum et ad reliqua navalia . <end>$$<start> In other parts of the town , they fought so obstinately , that they quitted the field with equal advantage , and neither were beaten (in consequence of the narrowness of the passes) ; and a few being killed on both sides , Caesar secured the most necessary posts , and fortified them in the night . <end>
<start> Interim filia minor Ptolomaei regis vacuam possessionem regni sperans ad Achillam sese ex regia traiecit unaque bellum administrare coepit . <end>$$<start> These fortifications he increased during the succeeding days , that he might have them before him as a rampart , and not be obliged to fight against his will . <end>
<start> Sed celeriter est inter eos de principatu controversia orta ; quae res apud milites largitiones auxit ; magnis enim iacturis sibi quisque eorum animos conciliabat . <end>$$<start> In the mean time Ptolemy's younger daughter , hoping the throne would become vacant , made her escape from the palace to Achillas , and assisted him in prosecuting the war . <end>
<start> Haec dum apud hostes geruntur , Pothinus , nutricius pueri et procurator regni in parte Caesaris , cum ad Achillam nuntios mitteret hortareturque , ne negotio desisteret neve animo deficeret , indicatis deprehensisque internuntiis a Caesare est interfectus . <end>$$<start> But they soon quarreled about the command , which circumstance enlarged the presents to the soldiers , for each endeavored by great sacrifices to secure their affection . <end>&&&&
