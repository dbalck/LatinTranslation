<start> Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres , quarum unam incolunt Belgae , aliam Aquitani , tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae , nostra Galli appellantur . <end>$$All Gaul is divided into three parts , one of which the Belgae inhabit , the Aquitani another , those who in their own language are called Celts , in ours Gauls , the third .
<start> Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen , a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit . <end>$$All these differ from each other in language , customs and laws .
<start> Eorum una pars , quam Gallos obtinere dictum est , initium capit a flumine Rhodano , continetur Garumna flumine , Oceano , finibus Belgarum , attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum , vergit ad septentriones . <end>$$One part of these , which it has been said that the Galli occupy , takes its beginning at the river Rhône ; it is bounded by the river Garonne , the ocean , and the territories of the Belgae ; it borders , too , on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii , upon the river Rhine , and stretches toward the north .
<start> Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur , pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni , spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem . <end>$$The Belgae rises from the extreme frontier of Gaul , extend to the lower part of the river Rhine ; and look toward the north and the rising sun .
<start> Apud Helvetios longe nobilissimus fuit et ditissimus Orgetorix . <end>$$Among the Helvetii , Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and wealthy .
<start> Is Marcus Messala , Marcus Pisone consulibus regni cupiditate inductus coniurationem nobilitatis fecit et civitati persuasit ut de finibus suis cum omnibus copiis exirent : perfacile esse , cum virtute omnibus praestarent , totius Galliae imperio potiri . <end>$$He , when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls , incited by lust of sovereignty , formed a conspiracy among the nobility , and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their possessions , that it would be very easy , since they excelled all in valour , to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Id hoc facilius iis persuasit , quod undique loci natura Helvetii continentur : una ex parte flumine Rheno latissimo atque altissimo , qui agrum Helvetium a Germanis dividit ; altera ex parte monte Iura altissimo , qui est inter Sequanos et Helvetios ; tertia lacu Lemanno et flumine Rhodano , qui provinciam nostram ab Helvetiis dividit . <end>$$To this he the more easily persuaded them , because the Helvetii are confined on every side by the nature of their situation ; on one side by the Rhine , a very broad and deep river , which separates the Helvetian territory from the Germans ; on a second side by the Jura , a very high mountain , which is between the Sequani and the Helvetii ; on a third by the Lake of Geneva , and by the river Rhône , which separates our Province from the Helvetii .
<start> His rebus fiebat ut et minus late vagarentur et minus facile finitimis bellum inferre possent ; qua ex parte homines bellandi cupidi magno dolore adficiebantur . <end>$$From these circumstances it resulted , that they could range less widely , and could less easily make war upon their neighbours ; for which reason men fond of war were affected with great regret .
<start> Pro multitudine autem hominum et pro gloria belli atque fortitudinis angustos se fines habere arbitrabantur , qui in longitudinem milia passuum CCXL , in latitudinem CLXXX patebant . <end>$$They thought , that considering the extent of their population , and their renown for warfare and bravery , they had but narrow limits , although they extended in length 240 , and in breadth 180 miles .
<start> His rebus adducti et auctoritate Orgetorigis permoti constituerunt ea quae ad proficiscendum pertinerent comparare , iumentorum et carrorum quam maximum numerum coemere , sementes quam maximas facere , ut in itinere copia frumenti suppeteret , cum proximis civitatibus pacem et amicitiam confirmare . <end>$$Induced by these considerations , and influenced by the authority of Orgetorix , they determined to provide such things as were necessary for their expedition—to buy up as great a number as possible of beasts of burden and wagons—to make their sowings as large as possible , so that on their march plenty of corn might be in store-and to establish peace and friendship with the neighboring states .
<start> Ad eas res conficiendas biennium sibi satis esse duxerunt ; in tertium annum profectionem lege confirmant . <end>$$They reckoned that a term of two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs ; they fix by decree their departure for the third year .
<start> Ad eas res conficiendas Orgetorix deligitur . <end>$$Orgetorix is chosen to complete these arrangements .
<start> Is sibi legationem ad civitates suscipit In eo itinere persuadet Castico , Catamantaloedis filio , Sequano , cuius pater regnum in Sequanis multos annos obtinuerat et a senatu populi Romani amicus appellatus erat , ut regnum in civitate sua occuparet , quod pater ante habuerit ; itemque Dumnorigi Haeduo , fratri Diviciaci , qui eo tempore principatum in civitate obtinebat ac maxime plebi acceptus erat , ut idem conaretur persuadet eique filiam suam in matrimonium dat . <end>$$He took upon himself the office of embassador to the states : on this journey he persuades Casticus , the son of Catamantaloedes , to seize upon the sovereignty in his own state , which his father had held before him , and he likewise persuades Dumnorix , an Aeduan , the brother of Diviciacus , who at that time possessed the chief authority in the state , and was exceedingly beloved by the people , to attempt the same , and gives him his daughter in marriage .
<start> Perfacile factu esse illis probat conata perficere , propterea quod ipse suae civitatis imperium obtenturus esset : non esse dubium quin totius Galliae plurimum Helvetii possent ; se suis copiis suoque exercitu illis regna conciliaturum confirmat . <end>$$He proves to them that to accomplish their attempts was a thing very easy to be done , because he himself would obtain the government of his own state ; that there was no doubt that the Helvetii were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul ; he assures them that he will , with his own forces and his own army , acquire the sovereignty for them .
<start> Hac oratione adducti inter se fidem et ius iurandum dant et regno occupato per tres potentissimos ac firmissimos populos totius Galliae sese potiri posse sperant . <end>$$Incited by this speech , they give a pledge and oath to one another , and hope that , when they have seized the sovereignty , they will , by means of the three most powerful and valiant nations , be enabled to obtain possession of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Ea res est Helvetiis per indicium enuntiata Moribus suis Orgetoricem ex vinculis causam dicere coegerunt ; damnatum poenam sequi oportebat , ut igni cremaretur . <end>$$When this scheme was disclosed to the Helvetii by informers , they , according to their custom , compelled Orgetorix to plead his cause in chains ; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire should await him if condemned .
<start> Die constituta causae dictionis Orgetorix ad iudicium omnem suam familiam , ad hominum milia decem , undique coegit , et omnes clientes obaeratosque suos , quorum magnum numerum habebat , eodem conduxit ; per eos ne causam diceret se eripuit . <end>$$On the day appointed for the pleading of his cause , Orgetorix drew together from all quarters to the court , all his vassals to the number of ten thousand persons ; and led together to the same place all his dependents and debtor-bondsmen , of whom he had a great number ; by means of those he rescued himself from pleading his cause .
<start> Cum civitas ob eam rem incitata armis ius suum exequi conaretur multitudinemque hominum ex agris magistratus cogerent , Orgetorix mortuus est ; neque abest suspicio , ut Helvetii arbitrantur , quin ipse sibi mortem consciverit . <end>$$While the state , incensed at this act , was endeavoring to assert its right by arms , and the magistrates were mustering a large body of men from the country , Orgetorix died ; and there is not wanting a suspicion , as the Helvetii think , of his having committed suicide .
<start> Post eius mortem nihilo minus Helvetii id quod constituerant facere conantur , ut e finibus suis exeant . <end>$$After his death , the Helvetii nevertheless attempt to do that which they had resolved on , namely , to go forth from their territories .
<start> Ubi iam se ad eam rem paratos esse arbitrati sunt , oppida sua omnia , numero ad duodecim , vicos ad quadringentos , reliqua privata aedificia incendunt ; frumentum omne , praeter quod secum portaturi erant , comburunt , ut domum reditionis spe sublata paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda essent ; trium mensum molita cibaria sibi quemque domo efferre iubent . <end>$$When they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking , they set fire to all their towns , in number about twelve-to their villages about four hundred-and to the private dwellings that remained ; they burn up all the corn , except what they intend to carry with them ; that after destroying the hope of a return home , they might be the more ready for undergoing all dangers .
<start> Persuadent Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis finitimis , uti eodem usi consilio oppidis suis vicisque exustis una cum iis proficiscantur , Boiosque , qui trans Rhenum incoluerant et in agrum Noricum transierant Noreiamque oppugnabant , receptos ad se socios sibi adsciscunt . <end>$$They order every one to carry forth from home for himself provisions for three months , ready ground They persuade the Rauraci , and the Tulingi , and the Latobrigi , their neighbors , to adopt the same plan , and after burning down their towns and villages , to set out with them : and they admit to their party and unite to themselves as confederates the Boii , who had dwelt on the other side of the Rhine , and had crossed over into the Norican territory , and assaulted Noreia .
<start> Erant omnino itinera duo , quibus itineribus domo exire possent : unum per Sequanos , angustum et difficile , inter montem Iuram et flumen Rhodanum , vix qua singuli carri ducerentur , mons autem altissimus impendebat , ut facile perpauci prohibere possent ; alterum per provinciam nostram , multo facilius atque expeditius , propterea quod inter fines Helvetiorum et Allobrogum , qui nuper pacati erant , Rhodanus fluit isque non nullis locis vado transitur . <end>$$There were in all two routes , by which they could go forth from their country one through the Sequani narrow and difficult , between Mount Jura and the river Rhone , the other , through our Province , much easier and freer from obstacles , because the Rhône flows between the boundaries of the Helvetii and those of the Allobroges , who had lately been subdued , and is in some places crossed by a ford .
<start> Extremum oppidum Allobrogum est proximumque Helvetiorum finibus Genava . <end>$$The furthest town of the Allobroges , and the nearest to the territories of the Helvetii , is Geneva .
<start> Ex eo oppido pons ad Helvetios pertinet . <end>$$From this town a bridge extends to the Helvetii .
<start> Allobrogibus sese vel persuasuros , quod nondum bono animo in populum Romanum viderentur , existimabant vel vi coacturos ut per suos fines eos ire paterentur . <end>$$They thought that they should either persuade the Allobroges , because they did not seem as yet well-affected toward the Roman people , or compel them by force to allow them to pass through their territories .
<start> Omnibus rebus ad profectionem comparatis diem dicunt , qua die ad ripam Rhodani omnes conveniant . <end>$$Having provided every thing for the expedition , they appoint a day , on which they should all meet on the bank of the Rhone .
<start> Is dies erat ante diem V Kalends Aprilis Lucius Pisone , Aulus Gabinio consulibus . <end>$$This day was the fifth before the kalends of April in the consulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius .
<start> Caesari cum id nuntiatum esset , eos per provinciam nostram iter facere conari , maturat ab urbe proficisci et quam maximis potest itineribus in Galliam ulteriorem contendit et ad Genavam pervenit . <end>$$When it was reported to Caesar that they were attempting to make their route through our Province he hastens to set out from the city , and , by as great marches as he can , proceeds to Further Gaul , and arrives at Geneva .
<start> Provinciae toti quam maximum potest militum numerum imperat (erat omnino in Gallia ulteriore legio una) , pontem , qui erat ad Genavam , iubet rescindi . <end>$$He orders the whole Province as great a number of soldiers as possible , as there was in all only one legion in Further Gaul : he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down .
<start> Ubi de eius adventu Helvetii certiores facti sunt , legatos ad eum mittunt nobilissimos civitatis , cuius legationis Nammeius et Verucloetius principem locum obtinebant , qui dicerent sibi esse in animo sine ullo maleficio iter per provinciam facere , propterea quod aliud iter haberent nullum : rogare ut eius voluntate id sibi facere liceat . <end>$$When the Helvetii are apprized of his arrival they send to him , as embassadors , the most illustrious men of their state , to say that it was their intention to march through the Province without doing any harm , because they had no other route : that they requested , they might be allowed to do so with his consent .
<start> Caesar , quod memoria tenebat Lucius Cassium consulem occisum exercitumque eius ab Helvetiis pulsum et sub iugum missum , concedendum non putabat ; neque homines inimico animo , data facultate per provinciam itineris faciundi , temperaturos ab iniuria et maleficio existimabat . <end>$$Caesar , inasmuch as he kept in remembrance that Lucius Cassius , the consul , had been slain , and his army routed and made to pass under the yoke by the Helvetii , did not think that ought to be granted : nor was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition , if an opportunity of marching through the Province were given them , would abstain from outrage and mischief .
<start> Tamen , ut spatium intercedere posset dum milites quos imperaverat convenirent , legatis respondit diem se ad deliberandum sumpturum : si quid vellent , ad Idus Apriles reverterentur . <end>$$Yet , in order that a period might intervene , until the soldiers whom he had ordered should assemble , he replied to the ambassadors , that he would take time to deliberate ; if they wanted any thing , they might return on the day before the ides of April .
<start> Interea ea legione quam secum habebat militibusque , qui ex provincia convenerant , a lacu Lemanno , qui in flumen Rhodanum influit , ad montem Iuram , qui fines Sequanorum ab Helvetiis dividit , milia passuum XVIIII murum in altitudinem pedum sedecim fossamque perducit . <end>$$Meanwhile , with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers which had assembled from the Province , he carries along for nineteen miles a wall , to the height of sixteen feet , and a trench , from the Lake of Geneva , which flows into the river Rhone , to Mount Jura , which separates the territories of the Sequani from those of the Helvetii .
<start> Eo opere perfecto praesidia disponit , castella communit , quo facilius , si se invito transire conentur , prohibere possit . <end>$$When that work was finished , he distributes garrisons , and closely fortifies redoubts , in order that he may the more easily intercept them , if they should attempt to cross over against his will .
<start> Ubi ea dies quam constituerat cum legatis venit et legati ad eum reverterunt , negat se more et exemplo populi Romani posse iter ulli per provinciam dare et , si vim facere conentur , prohibiturum ostendit . <end>$$When the day which he had appointed with the embassadors came , and they returned to him ; he says , that he can not , consistently with the custom and precedent of the Roman people , grant any one a passage through the Province ; and he gives them to understand , that , if they should attempt to use violence he would oppose them .
<start> Helvetii ea spe deiecti navibus iunctis ratibusque compluribus factis , alii vadis Rhodani , qua minima altitudo fluminis erat , non numquam interdiu , saepius noctu si perrumpere possent conati , operis munitione et militum concursu et telis repulsi , hoc conatu destiterunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , disappointed in this hope , tried , if they could , to force a passage , but being kept at bay by the strength of our works , and by the concourse of the soldiers , and by the missiles , they desisted from this attempt .
<start> Relinquebatur una per Sequanos via , qua Sequanis invitis propter angustias ire non poterant . <end>$$There was left one way , through the Sequani , by which , on account of its narrowness , they could not pass without the consent of the Sequani .
<start> His cum sua sponte persuadere non possent , legatos ad Dumnorigem Haeduum mittunt , ut eo deprecatore a Sequanis impetrarent . <end>$$As they could not of themselves prevail on them , they send embassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan , that through his intercession , they might obtain their request from the Sequani .
<start> Dumnorix gratia et largitione apud Sequanos plurimum poterat et Helvetiis erat amicus , quod ex ea civitate Orgetorigis filiam in matrimonium duxerat , et cupiditate regni adductus novis rebus studebat et quam plurimas civitates suo beneficio habere obstrictas volebat . <end>$$Dumnorix , by his popularity and liberality , had great influence among the Sequani , and was friendly to the Helvetii , because out of that state he had married the daughter of Orgetorix ; and , incited by lust of sovereignty , was anxious for a revolution , and wished to have as many states as possible attached to him by his kindness toward them .
<start> Itaque rem suscipit et a Sequanis impetrat ut per fines suos Helvetios ire patiantur , obsidesque uti inter sese dent perficit : Sequani , ne itinere Helvetios prohibeant , Helvetii , ut sine maleficio et iniuria transeant . <end>$$He , therefore , undertakes the affair , and prevails upon the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to march through their territories , and arranges that they should give hostages to each other-the Sequani not to obstruct the Helvetii in their march-the Helvetii , to pass without mischief and outrage .
<start> Caesari renuntiatur Helvetiis esse in animo per agrum Sequanorum et Haeduorum iter in Santonum fines facere , qui non longe a Tolosatium finibus absunt , quae civitas est in provincia . <end>$$It is again told to Caesar , that the Helvetii intended to march through the country of the Sequani and the Aedui into the territories of the Santones , which are not far distant from those boundaries of the Tolosates , which is a state in the Province .
<start> Id si fieret , intellegebat magno cum periculo provinciae futurum ut homines bellicosos , populi Romani inimicos , locis patentibus maximeque frumentariis finitimos haberet . <end>$$If this took place , he saw that it would be attended with great danger to the Province to have warlike men , enemies of the Roman people , bordering upon an open and very fertile tract of country .
<start> Ob eas causas ei munitioni quam fecerat Titus Labienum legatum praeficit ; ipse in Italiam magnis itineribus contendit duasque ibi legiones conscribit et tres , quae circum Aquileiam hiemabant , ex hibernis educit et , qua proximum iter in ulteriorem Galliam per Alpes erat , cum his quinque legionibus ire contendit . <end>$$For these reasons he appointed Titus Labienus , his legate , to the command of the fortification which he had made He himself proceeds to Italy by forced marches , and there levies two legions , and leads out from winter-quarters three which were wintering around Aquileia , and with these five legions marches rapidly by the nearest route across the Alps into Further Gaul .
<start> Ibi Ceutrones et Graioceli et Caturiges locis superioribus occupatis itinere exercitum prohibere conantur . <end>$$Here the Centrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges , having taken possession of the higher parts , attempt to obstruct the army in their march .
<start> Compluribus his proeliis pulsis ab Ocelo , quod est oppidum citerioris provinciae extremum , in fines Vocontiorum ulterioris provinciae die septimo pervenit ; inde in Allobrogum fines , ab Allobrogibus in Segusiavos exercitum ducit . <end>$$After having routed these in several battles , he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on the seventh day from Ocelum , which is the most remote town of the Hither Province ; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges , and from the Allobroges to the Segusiani .
<start> Hi sunt extra provinciam trans Rhodanum primi . <end>$$These people are the first beyond the Province on the opposite side of the Rhône .
<start> Helvetii iam per angustias et fines Sequanorum suas copias traduxerant et in Haeduorum fines pervenerant eorumque agros populabantur . <end>$$The Helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the narrow defile and the territories of the Sequani , and had arrived at the territories of the Aedui , and were ravaging their lands .
<start> Haedui , cum se suaque ab iis defendere non possent , legatos ad Caesarem mittunt rogatum auxilium : ita se omni tempore de populo Romano meritos esse ut paene in conspectu exercitus nostri agri vastari , liberi in servitutem abduci , oppida expugnari non debuerint . <end>$$The Aedui , as they could not defend themselves and their possessions against them , send embassadors to Caesar to ask assistance , that they had at all times so well deserved of the Roman people , that their fields ought not to have been laid waste-their children carried off into slavery-their towns stormed , almost within sight of our army .
<start> Eodem tempore quo Haedui Ambarri , necessarii et consanguinei Haeduorum , Caesarem certiorem faciunt sese depopulatis agris non facile ab oppidis vim hostium prohibere Item Allobroges , qui trans Rhodanum vicos possessionesque habebant , fuga se ad Caesarem recipiunt et demonstrant sibi praeter agri solum nihil esse reliqui . <end>$$At the same time the Ambarri , the friends and kinsmen of the Aedui , apprize Caesar , that it was not easy for them , now that their fields had been devastated , to ward off the violence of the enemy from their towns : the Allobroges likewise , who had villages and possessions on the other side of the Rhône , betake themselves in flight to Caesar , and assure him that they had nothing remaining , except the soil of their land .
<start> Quibus rebus adductus Caesar non expectandum sibi statuit dum , omnibus , fortunis sociorum consumptis , in Santonos Helvetii pervenirent . <end>$$Caesar , induced by these circumstances , decides , that he ought not to wait until the Helvetii , after destroying all the property of his allies , should arrive among the Santones .
<start> Flumen est Arar , quod per fines Haeduorum et Sequanorum in Rhodanum influit , incredibili lenitate , ita ut oculis in utram partem fluat iudicari non possit . <end>$$There is a river the Saône , which flows through the territories of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhône with such incredible slowness , that it can not be determined by the eye in which direction it flows .
<start> Id Helvetii ratibus ac lintribus iunctis transibant . <end>$$This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined together .
<start> Ubi per exploratores Caesar certior factus est tres iam partes copiarum Helvetios id flumen traduxisse , quartam vero partem citra flumen Ararim reliquam esse , de tertia vigilia cum legionibus tribus e castris profectus ad eam partem pervenit quae nondum flumen transierat . <end>$$When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had already conveyed three parts of their forces across that river , but that the fourth part was left behind on this side of the Saône , he set out from the camp with three legions during the third watch , and came up with that division which had not yet crossed the river .
<start> Eos impeditos et inopinantes adgressus magnam partem eorum concidit ; reliqui sese fugae mandarunt atque in proximas silvas abdiderunt . <end>$$Attacking them encumbered with baggage , and not expecting him , he cut to pieces a great part of them ; the rest betook themselves to flight , and concealed themselves in the nearest woods .
<start> Is pagus appellabatur Tigurinus ; nam omnis civitas Helvetia in quattuor pagos divisa est . <end>$$That canton was called the Tigurine ; for the whole Helvetian state is divided into four cantons .
<start> Hic pagus unus , cum domo exisset , patrum nostrorum memoria Lucius Cassium consulem interfecerat et eius exercitum sub iugum miserat . <end>$$This single canton having left their country , within the recollection of our fathers , had slain Lucius Cassius the consul , and had made his army pass under the yoke .
<start> Ita sive casu sive consilio deorum immortalium quae pars civitatis Helvetiae insignem calamitatem populo Romano intulerat , ea princeps poenam persolvit . <end>$$Thus , whether by chance , or by the design of the immortal gods , that part of the Helvetian state which had brought a signal calamity upon the Roman people , was the first to pay the penalty .
<start> Qua in re Caesar non solum publicas , sed etiam privatas iniurias ultus est , quod eius soceri Lucius Pisonis avum , Lucius Pisonem legatum , Tigurini eodem proelio quo Cassium interfecerant . <end>$$In this Caesar avenged not only the public but also his own personal wrongs , because the Tigurini had slain Lucius Piso the legate , the grandfather of Lucius Calpurnius Piso , his father-in-law , in the same battle as Cassius himself .
<start> Hoc proelio facto reliquas copias Helvetiorum ut consequi posset , pontem in Arari faciendum curat atque ita exercitum traducit . <end>$$This battle ended , that he might be able to come up with the remaining forces of the Helvetii , he procures a bridge to be made across the Saône , and thus leads his army over .
<start> Is ita cum Caesare egit : si pacem populus Romanus cum Helvetiis faceret , in eam partem ituros atque ibi futuros Helvetios ubi eos Caesar constituisset atque esse voluisset ; sin bello persequi perseveraret , reminisceretur et veteris incommodi populi Romani et pristinae virtutis Helvetiorum . <end>$$The Helvetii , confused by his sudden arrival , when they found that he had effected in one day , what they , themselves had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in twenty namely , the crossing of the river , send embassadors to him ; at the head of which embassy was Divico , who had been commander of the Helvetii , in the war against Cassius .
<start> His Caesar ita respondit : eo sibi minus dubitationis dari , quod eas res quas legati Helvetii commemorassent memoria teneret , atque eo gravius ferre quo minus merito populi Romani accidissent ; qui si alicuius iniuriae sibi conscius fuisset , non fuisse difficile cavere ; sed eo deceptum , quod neque commissum a se intellegeret quare timeret neque sine causa timendum putaret . <end>$$To these words Caesar thus replied : —that on that very account he felt less hesitation , because he kept in remembrance those circumstances which the Helvetian embassadors had mentioned , and that he felt the more indignant at them , in proportion as they had happened undeservedly to the Roman people : for if they had been conscious of having done any wrong , it would not have been difficult to be on their guard , but for that very reason had they been deceived , because neither were they aware that any offense had been given by them , on account of which they should be afraid , nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without cause .
<start> Quod si veteris contumeliae oblivisci vellet , num etiam recentium iniuriarum , quod eo invito iter per provinciam per vim temptassent , quod Haeduos , quod Ambarros , quod Allobrogas vexassent , memoriam deponere posse ? Quod sua victoria tam insolenter gloriarentur quodque tam diu se impune iniurias tulisse admirarentur , eodem pertinere Consuesse enim deos immortales , quo gravius homines ex commutatione rerum doleant , quos pro scelere eorum ulcisci velint , his secundiores interdum res et diuturniorem impunitatem concedere . <end>$$But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage , could he also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs , in that they had against his will attempted a route through the Province by force , in that they had molested the Aedui , the Ambarri , and the Allobroges ? That as to their so insolently boasting of their victory , and as to their being astonished that they had so long committed their outrages with impunity , tended to the same point ; for the immortal gods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to punish for their guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity , in order that they may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances .
<start> Cum ea ita sint , tamen , si obsides ab iis sibi dentur , uti ea quae polliceantur facturos intellegat , et si Haeduis de iniuriis quas ipsis sociisque eorum intulerint , item si Allobrogibus satisfaciant , sese cum iis pacem esse facturum . <end>$$Although these things are so , yet , if hostages were to be given him by them in order that he may be assured these will do what they promise , and provided they will give satisfaction to the Aedui for the outrages which they had committed against them and their allies , and likewise to the Allobroges , he will make peace with them .
<start> Divico respondit : ita Helvetios a maioribus suis institutos esse uti obsides accipere , non dare , consuerint ; eius rei populum Romanum esse testem . <end>$$Divico replied , that the Helvetii had been so trained by their ancestors , that they were accustomed to receive , not to give hostages ; of that fact the Roman people were witness .
<start> Hoc responso dato discessit . <end>$$Having given this reply , he withdrew .
<start> Postero die castra ex eo loco movent Idem facit Caesar equitatumque omnem , ad numerum quattuor milium , quem ex omni provincia et Haeduis atque eorum sociis coactum habebat , praemittit , qui videant quas in partes hostes iter faciant . <end>$$On the following day they move their camp from that place ; Caesar does the same , and sends forward all his cavalry , to the number of four thousand , to observe toward what parts the enemy are directing their march .
<start> Qui cupidius novissimum agmen insecuti alieno loco cum equitatu Helvetiorum proelium committunt ; et pauci de nostris cadunt . <end>$$These , having too eagerly pursued the enemy's rear , come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in a disadvantageous place , and a few of our men fall .
<start> Quo proelio sublati Helvetii , quod quingentis equitibus tantam multitudinem equitum propulerant , audacius subsistere non numquam et novissimo agmine proelio nostros lacessere coeperunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , elated with this battle , because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so large a body of horse , began to face us more boldly , sometimes too from their rear to provoke our men by an attack .
<start> Caesar suos a proelio continebat , ac satis habebat in praesentia hostem rapinis , pabulationibus populationibusque prohibere . <end>$$Caesar restrained his men from battle , deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine , forage , and depredation .
<start> Ita dies circiter XV iter fecerunt uti inter novissimum hostium agmen et nostrum primum non amplius quinis aut senis milibus passuum interesset . <end>$$They marched for about fifteen days in such a manner that there was not more than five or six miles between the enemy's rear and our van .
<start> Interim cotidie Caesar Haeduos frumentum , quod essent publice polliciti , flagitare Nam propter frigora non modo frumenta in agris matura non erant , sed ne pabuli quidem satis magna copia suppetebat ; eo autem frumento quod flumine Arari navibus subvexerat propterea uti minus poterat quod iter ab Arari Helvetii averterant , a quibus discedere nolebat . <end>$$Meanwhile , Caesar kept daily importuning the Aedui for the corn which they had promised in the name of their state ; for , in consequence of the coldness , not only was the corn in the fields not ripe , but there was not in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder : besides he was unable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river Saône , because the Helvetii , from whom he was unwilling to retire had diverted their march from the Saône .
<start> Diem ex die ducere Haedui : conferri , comportari , adesse dicere . <end>$$The Aedui kept deferring from day to day , and saying that it was being collected—brought in—on the road .
<start> Ubi se diutius duci intellexit et diem instare quo die frumentum militibus metiri oporteret , convocatis eorum principibus , quorum magnam copiam in castris habebat , in his Diviciaco et Lisco , qui summo magistratui praeerat , quem vergobretum appellant Haedui , qui creatur annuus et vitae necisque in suos habet potestatem , graviter eos accusat , quod , cum neque emi neque ex agris sumi possit , tam necessario tempore , tam propinquis hostibus ab iis non sublevetur , praesertim cum magna ex parte eorum precibus adductus bellum susceperit  . <end>$$When he saw that he was put off too long , and that the day was close at hand on which he ought to serve out the corn to his soldiers ; —having called together their chiefs , of whom he had a great number in his camp , among them Diviciacus and Liscus who was invested with the chief magistracy , he severely reprimands them , because he is not assisted by them on so urgent an occasion , when the enemy were so close at hand , and when could neither be bought nor taken from the fields , particularly as , in a great measure urged by their prayers , he had undertaken the war ; much more bitterly , therefore does he complain of his being forsaken .
<start> Tum demum Liscus oratione Caesaris adductus quod antea tacuerat proponit : esse non nullos , quorum auctoritas apud plebem plurimum valeat , qui privatim plus possint quam ipsi magistratus Hos seditiosa atque improba oratione multitudinem deterrere , ne frumentum conferant quod debeant : praestare , si iam principatum Galliae obtinere non possint , Gallorum quam Romanorum imperia perferre , neque dubitare quin , si Helvetios superaverint Romani , una cum reliqua Gallia Haeduis libertatem sint erepturi . <end>$$Then at length Liscus , moved by Caesar's speech , discloses what he had hitherto kept secret : —that there are some whose influences with the people is very great , who , though private men , have more power than the magistrates themselves : that these by seditions and violent language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought to supply ; that , if they can not any longer retain the supremacy of Gaul , it were better to submit to the government of Gauls than of Romans , nor ought they to doubt that , if the Romans should overpower the Helvetii , they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui together with the remainder of Gaul .
<start> Ab isdem nostra consilia quaeque in castris gerantur hostibus enuntiari ; hos a se coerceri non posse Quin etiam , quod necessariam rem coactus Caesari enuntiarit , intellegere sese quanto id cum periculo fecerit , et ob eam causam quam diu potuerit tacuisse . <end>$$By these very men , , are our plans and whatever is done in the camp , disclosed to the enemy ; that they could not be restrained by him : nay more , he was well aware , that though compelled by necessity , he had disclosed the matter to Caesar , at how great a risk he had done it ; and for that reason , he had been silent as long as he could .
<start> Caesar hac oratione Lisci Dumnorigem , Diviciaci fratrem , designari sentiebat , sed , quod pluribus praesentibus eas res iactari nolebat , celeriter concilium dimittit , Liscum retinet . <end>$$Caesar perceived that by this speech of Liscus , Dumnorix , the brother of Diviciacus , was indicated ; but , as he was unwilling that these matters should be discussed while so many were present , he speedily dismisses the council , but detains Liscus : he inquires from him when alone , about those things which he had said in the meeting .
<start> His rebus et suam rem familiarem auxisse et facultates ad largiendum magnas comparasse ; magnum numerum equitatus suo sumptu semper alere et circum se habere , neque solum domi , sed etiam apud finitimas civitates largiter posse , atque huius potentiae causa matrem in Biturigibus homini illic nobilissimo ac potentissimo conlocasse ; ipsum ex Helvetiis uxorem habere , sororem ex matre et propinquas suas nuptum in alias civitates conlocasse Favere et cupere Helvetiis propter eam adfinitatem , odisse etiam suo nomine Caesarem et Romanos , quod eorum adventu potentia eius deminuta et Diviciacus frater in antiquum locum gratiae atque honoris sit restitutus . <end>$$He makes inquiries on the same points privately of others , and discovered that it is all true ; that Dumnorix is the person , a man of the highest daring , in great favor with the people on account of his liberality , a man eager for a revolution : that for a great many years he has been in the habit of contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the Aedui at a small cost , because when he bids , no one dares to bid against him .
<start> Itaque prius quam quicquam conaretur , Diviciacum ad se vocari iubet et , cotidianis interpretibus remotis , per Gaius Valerium Troucillum , principem Galliae provinciae , familiarem suum , cui summam omnium rerum fidem habebat , cum eo conloquitur ; simul commonefacit quae ipso praesente in concilio de Dumnorige sint dicta , et ostendit quae separatim quisque de eo apud se dixerit . <end>$$One thing stood in the way of all this-that he had learned by experience his brother Diviciacus's very high regard for the Roman people , his great affection toward him , his distinguished faithfulness , justice , and moderation ; for he was afraid lest by the punishment of this man , he should hurt the feelings of Diviciacus .
<start> Diviciacus multis cum lacrimis Caesarem complexus obsecrare coepit ne quid gravius in fratrem statueret : scire se illa esse vera , nec quemquam ex eo plus quam se doloris capere , propterea quod , cum ipse gratia plurimum domi atque in reliqua Gallia , ille minimum propter adulescentiam posset , per se crevisset ; quibus opibus ac nervis non solum ad minuendam gratiam , sed paene ad perniciem suam uteretur . <end>$$Diviciacus , embracing Caesar , begins to implore him , with many tears , that he would not pass any very severe sentence upon his brother ; saying , that he knows that those charges are true , and that nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did ; for when he himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and in the rest of Gaul , and he very little on account of his youth , the latter had become powerful through his means , which power and strength he used not only to the lessening of his popularity , but almost to his ruin ; that he , however , was influenced both by fraternal affection and by public opinion .
<start> Sese tamen et amore fraterno et existimatione vulgi commoveri Quod si quid ei a Caesare gravius accidisset , cum ipse eum locum amicitiae apud eum teneret , neminem existimaturum non sua voluntate factum ; qua ex re futurum uti totius Galliae animi a se averterentur . <end>$$But if any thing very severe from Caesar should befall him , no one would think that it had been done without his consent , since he himself held such a place in Caesar's friendship : from which circumstance it would arise , that the affections of the whole of Gaul would be estranged from him .
<start> Haec cum pluribus verbis flens a Caesare peteret , Caesar eius dextram prendit ; consolatus rogat finem orandi faciat ; tanti eius apud se gratiam esse ostendit uti et rei publicae iniuriam et suum dolorem eius voluntati ac precibus condonet . <end>$$As he was with tears begging these things of Caesar in many words , Caesar takes his right hand , and , comforting him , begs him to make an end of entreating , and assures him that his regard for him is so great , that he forgives both the injuries of the republic and his private wrongs , at his desire and prayers .
<start> Dumnorigem ad se vocat , fratrem adhibet ; quae in eo reprehendat ostendit ; quae ipse intellegat , quae civitas queratur proponit ; monet ut in reliquum tempus omnes suspiciones vitet ; praeterita se Diviciaco fratri condonare dicit . <end>$$He summons Dumnorix to him ; he brings in his brother ; he points out what he censures in him ; he lays before him what he of himself perceives , and what the state complains of ; he warns him for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion ; he says that he pardons the past , for the sake of his brother , Diviciacus .
<start> Dumnorigi custodes ponit , ut quae agat , quibuscum loquatur scire possit . <end>$$He sets spies over Dumnorix that he may be able to know what he does , and with whom he communicates .
<start> Eodem die ab exploratoribus certior factus hostes sub monte consedisse milia passuum ab ipsius castris octo , qualis esset natura montis et qualis in circuitu ascensus qui cognoscerent misit . <end>$$Being on the same day informed by his scouts , that the enemy had encamped at the foot of a mountain eight miles from his own camp ; he sent persons to ascertain what the nature of the mountain was , and of what kind the ascent on every side .
<start> Renuntiatum est facilem esse . <end>$$Word was brought back , that it was easy .
<start> De tertia vigilia Titus Labienum , legatum pro praetore , cum duabus legionibus et iis ducibus qui iter cognoverant summum iugum montis ascendere iubet ; quid sui consilii sit ostendit . <end>$$During the third watch he orders Titus Labienus , his legate with praetorian powers , to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain with two legions , and with those as guides who had examined the road ; he explains what his plan is .
<start> Ipse de quarta vigilia eodem itinere quo hostes ierant ad eos contendit equitatumque omnem ante se mittit . <end>$$He himself during the fourth watch , hastens to them by the same route by which the enemy had gone , and sends on all the cavalry before him .
<start> Publius Considius , qui rei militaris peritissimus habebatur et in exercitu Lucius Sullae et postea in Marcus Crassi fuerat , cum exploratoribus praemittitur . <end>$$Publius Considius , who was reputed to be very experienced in military affairs , and had been in the army of Lucius Sulla , and afterward in that of Marcus Crassus , is sent forward with the scouts .
<start> Prima luce , cum summus mons a Labieno teneretur , ipse ab hostium castris non longius mille et quingentis passibus abesset neque , ut postea ex captivis comperit , aut ipsius adventus aut Labieni cognitus esset , Considius equo admisso ad eum accurrit , dicit montem , quem a Labieno occupari voluerit , ab hostibus teneri : id se a Gallicis armis atque insignibus cognovisse . <end>$$At day-break , when the summit of the mountain was in the possession of Titus Labienus , and he himself was not further off than a mile and half from the enemy's camp , nor , as he afterward ascertained from the captives , had either his arrival or that of Labienus been discovered ; Considius , with his horse at full gallop , comes up to him says that the mountain which he wished should be seized by Labienus , is in possession of the enemy ; that he has discovered this by the Gallic arms and ensigns .
<start> Caesar suas copias in proximum collem subducit , aciem instruit . <end>$$Caesar leads off his forces to the next hill : draws them up in battle-order .
<start> Labienus , ut erat ei praeceptum a Caesare ne proelium committeret , nisi ipsius copiae prope hostium castra visae essent , ut undique uno tempore in hostes impetus fieret , monte occupato nostros expectabat proelioque abstinebat . <end>$$Labienus , as he had been ordered by Caesar not to come to an engagement unless own forces were seen near the enemy's camp , that the attack upon the enemy might be made on every side at the same time , was , after having taken possession of the mountain , waiting for our men , and refraining from battle .
<start> Multo denique die per exploratores Caesar cognovit et montem a suis teneri et Helvetios castra , movisse et Considium timore perterritum quod non vidisset pro viso sibi renuntiavisse . <end>$$When , at length , the day was far advanced , Caesar learned through spies , that the mountain was in possession of his own men , and that the Helvetii had moved their camp , and that Considius , struck with fear , had reported to him , as seen , that which he had not seen .
<start> Eo die quo consuerat intervallo hostes sequitur et milia passuum tria ab eorum castris castra ponit . <end>$$On that day he follows the enemy at his usual distance , and pitches his camp three miles from theirs .
<start> Ea res per fugitivos Lucius Aemilii , decurionis equitum Gallorum , hostibus nuntiatur . <end>$$This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some deserters from Lucius Aemilius , a captain of the Gallic horse .
<start> Helvetii , seu quod timore perterritos Romanos discedere a se existimarent , eo magis quod pridie superioribus locis occupatis proelium non commisissent , sive eo quod re frumentaria intercludi posse confiderent , commutato consilio atque itinere converso nostros a novissimo agmine insequi ac lacessere coeperunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , either because they thought that the Romans , struck with terror , were retreating from them , the more so , as the day before , though they had seized on the higher grounds , they had not joined battle or because they flattered themselves that they might be cut of from the provisions , altering their plan and changing their route , began to pursue , and to annoy our men in the rear .
<start> Postquam id animum advertit , copias suas Caesar in proximum collem subduxit equitatumque , qui sustineret hostium impetum , misit . <end>$$Caesar , when he observes this , draws off his forces to the next hill , and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy .
<start> Ipse interim in colle medio triplicem aciem instruxit legionum quattuor veteranarum ; in summo iugo duas legiones quas in Gallia citeriore proxime conscripserat et omnia auxilia conlocavit , ita ut supra se totum montem hominibus compleret ; impedimenta sarcinasque in unum locum conferri et eum ab iis qui in superiore acie constiterant muniri iussit . <end>$$He himself , meanwhile , drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of his four veteran legions in such a manner , that he placed above him on the very summit the two legions , which he had lately levied in Hither Gaul , and all the auxiliaries ; and he ordered that the whole mountain should be covered with men , and that meanwhile the baggage should be brought together into one place , and the position be protected by those who were posted in the upper line .
<start> Helvetii cum omnibus suis carris secuti impedimenta in unum locum contulerunt ; ipsi confertissima acie , reiecto nostro equitatu , phalange facta sub primam nostram aciem successerunt . <end>$$The Helvetii having followed with all their wagons , collected their baggage into one place : they themselves , after having repulsed our cavalry and formed a phalanx , advanced up to our front line in very close order .
<start> Caesar primum suo , deinde omnium ex conspectu remotis equis , ut aequato omnium periculo spem fugae tolleret , cohortatus suos proelium commisit . <end>$$Caesar , having removed out of sight first his own horse , then those of all , that he might make the danger of all equal , and do away with the hope of flight , after encouraging his men , joined battle .
<start> Milites loco superiore pilis missis facile hostium phalangem perfregerunt . <end>$$His soldiers hurling their javelins from the higher ground , easily broke the enemy's phalanx .
<start> Ea disiecta gladiis destrictis in eos impetum fecerunt . <end>$$That being dispersed , they made a charge on them with drawn swords .
<start> Gallis magno ad pugnam erat impedimento quod pluribus eorum scutis uno ictu pilorum transfixis et conligatis , cum ferrum se inflexisset , neque evellere neque sinistra impedita satis commode pugnare poterant , multi ut diu iactato bracchio praeoptarent scutum manu emittere et nudo corpore pugnare . <end>$$It was a great hinderance to the Gauls in fighting , that , when several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the javelins pierced through and pinned fast together , as the point of the iron had bent itself , they could neither pluck it out , nor , with their left hand entangled , fight with sufficient ease ; so that many , after having long tossed their arm about , chose rather to cast away the buckler from their hand , and to fight with their person unprotected .
<start> Tandem vulneribus defessi et pedem referre et , quod mons suberit circiter mille passuum <spatio> , eo se recipere coeperunt . <end>$$At length , worn out with wounds , they began to give way , and , as there was in the neighborhood a mountain about a mile off , to betake themselves thither .
<start> Capto monte et succedentibus nostris , Boi et Tulingi , qui hominum milibus circiter XV agmen hostium claudebant et novissimis praesidio erant , ex itinere nostros ab latere aperto adgressi circumvenere , et id conspicati Helvetii , qui in montem sese receperant , rursus instare et proelium redintegrare coeperunt . <end>$$When the mountain had been gained , and our men were advancing up , the Boii and Tulingi , who with about 15 , 000 men closed the enemy's line of march and served as a guard to their rear , having assailed our men on the exposed flank as they advanced to surround them ; upon seeing which , the Helvetii who had betaken themselves to the mountain , began to press on again and renew the battle .
<start> Romani signa bipertito intulerunt : prima et secunda acies , ut victis ac submotis resisteret , tertia , ut venientes sustineret . <end>$$The Romans having faced about , advanced to the attack in two divisions ; the first and second line , to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off the field ; the third to receive those who were just arriving .
<start> Ita ancipiti proelio diu atque acriter pugnatum est . <end>$$Thus , was the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful success .
<start> Diutius cum sustinere nostrorum impetus non possent , alteri se , ut coeperant , in montem receperunt , alteri ad impedimenta et carros suos se contulerunt . <end>$$When they could no longer withstand the attacks of our men , the one division , as they had begun to do , betook themselves to the mountain ; the other repaired to their baggage and wagons .
<start> Nam hoc toto proelio , cum ab hora septima ad vesperum pugnatum sit , aversum hostem videre nemo potuit . <end>$$For during the whole of this battle , although the fight lasted from the seventh hour to eventide , no one could see an enemy with his back turned .
<start> Ad multam noctem etiam ad impedimenta pugnatum est , propterea quod pro vallo carros obiecerunt et e loco superiore in nostros venientes tela coiciebant et non nulli inter carros rotasque mataras ac tragulas subiciebant nostrosque vulnerabant . <end>$$The fight was carried on also at the baggage till late in the night , for they had set wagons in the way as a rampart , and from the higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men , as they came on , and some from between the wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and javelins from beneath , and wounding our men .
<start> Diu cum esset pugnatum , impedimentis castrisque nostri potiti sunt . <end>$$After the fight had lasted some time , our men gained possession of their baggage and camp .
<start> Ibi Orgetorigis filia atque unus e filiis captus est . <end>$$There the daughter and one of the sons of Orgetorix was taken .
<start> Ex eo proelio circiter hominum milia CXXX superfuerunt eaque tota nocte continenter ierunt ; in fines Lingonum die quarto pervenerunt , cum et propter vulnera militum et propter sepulturam occisorum nostri eos sequi non potuissent . <end>$$After the battle about 130 , 000 men remained alive , who marched incessantly during the whole of that night ; and after a march discontinued for no part of the night , arrived in the territories of the Lingones on the fourth day , while our men , having stopped for three days , both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of the slain , had not been able to follow them .
<start> Caesar ad Lingonas litteras nuntiosque misit , ne eos frumento neve alia re iuvarent : qui si iuvissent , se eodem loco quo Helvetios habiturum . <end>$$Caesar sent letters and messengers to the Lingones that they should not assist them with corn or with any thing else ; for that if they should assist them , he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii .
<start> Ipse triduo intermisso cum omnibus copiis eos sequi coepit . <end>$$After the three days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his forces .
<start> Helvetii omnium rerum inopia adducti legatos de deditione ad eum miserunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , compelled by the want of every thing , sent embassadors to him about a surrender .
<start> Qui cum eum in itinere convenissent seque ad pedes proiecissent suppliciterque locuti flentes pacem petissent , atque eos in eo loco quo tum essent suum adventum expectare iussisset , paruerunt . <end>$$When these had met him on the way and had thrown themselves at his feet , and speaking in suppliant tone had with tears sued for peace , and he had ordered them to await his arrival , in the place , where they then were , they obeyed his commands .
<start> Eo postquam Caesar pervenit , obsides , arma , servos qui ad eos perfugissent , poposcit . <end>$$When Caesar arrived at that place , he demanded hostages , their arms , and the slaves who had deserted to them .
<start> Dum ea conquiruntur et conferuntur , circiter hominum milia VI eius pagi qui Verbigenus appellatur , sive timore perterriti , ne armis traditis supplicio adficerentur , sive spe salutis inducti , quod in tanta multitudine dediticiorum suam fugam aut occultari aut omnino ignorari posse existimarent , prima nocte e castris Helvetiorum egressi ad Rhenum finesque Germanorum contenderunt . <end>$$While those things are being sought for and got together , after a night's interval , about 6000 men of that canton which is called the Verbigene , whether terrified by fear , lest after delivering up their arms , they should suffer punishment , or else induced by the hope of safety , because they supposed that , amid so vast a multitude of those who had surrendered themselves , their flight might either be concealed or entirely overlooked , having at night-fall departed out of the camp of the Helvetii , hastened to the Rhine and the territories of the Germans .
<start> Quod ubi Caesar resciit , quorum per fines ierant his uti conquirerent et reducerent , si sibi purgati esse vellent , imperavit ; reductos in hostium numero habuit ; reliquos omnes obsidibus , armis , perfugis traditis in deditionem accepit . <end>$$But when Caesar discovered this , he commanded those through whose territory they had gone , to seek them out and to bring them back again , if they meant to be acquitted before him ; and considered them , when brought back , in the light of enemies ; he admitted all the rest to a surrender , upon their delivering up the hostages , arms , and deserters .
<start> Helvetios , Tulingos , Latobrigos in fines suos , unde erant profecti , reverti iussit , et , quod omnibus frugibus amissis domi nihil erat quo famem tolerarent , Allobrogibus imperavit ut iis frumenti copiam facerent ; ipsos oppida vicosque , quos incenderant , restituere iussit . <end>$$He ordered the Helvetii , the Tulingi , and the Latobrigi , to return to their territories from which they had come , and as there was at home nothing whereby they might support their hunger , all the productions of the earth having been destroyed , he commanded the Allobroges to let them have a plentiful supply of corn ; and ordered them to rebuild the towns and villages which they had burned .
<start> Id ea maxime ratione fecit , quod noluit eum locum unde Helvetii discesserant vacare , ne propter bonitatem agrorum Germani , qui trans Rhenum incolunt , ex suis finibus in Helvetiorum fines transirent et finitimi Galliae provinciae Allobrogibusque essent . <end>$$This he did , chiefly , on this account , because he was unwilling that the country , from which the Helvetii had departed , should be untenanted , lest the Germans , who dwell on the other side of the Rhine , should , on account of the excellence of the lands , cross over from their own territories into those of the Helvetii , and become borderers upon the province of Gaul and the Allobroges .
<start> Boios petentibus Haeduis , quod egregia virtute erant cogniti , ut in finibus suis conlocarent , concessit ; quibus illi agros dederunt quosque postea in parem iuris libertatisque condicionem atque ipsi erant receperunt . <end>$$He granted the petition of the Aedui , that they might settle the Boii , in their own territories , as these were known to be of distinguished valor , to whom they gave lands , and whom they afterward admitted to the same state of rights and freedom as themselves .
<start> Bello Helvetiorum confecto totius fere Galliae legati , principes civitatum , ad Caesarem gratulatum convenerunt : intellegere sese , tametsi pro veteribus Helvetiorum iniuriis populi Romani ab his poenas bello repetisset , tamen eam rem non minus ex usu Galliae quam populi Romani accidisse , propterea quod eo consilio florentissimis rebus domos suas Helvetii reliquissent uti toti Galliae bellum inferrent imperioque potirentur , locumque domicilio ex magna copia deligerent quem ex omni Gallia oportunissimum ac fructuosissimum iudicassent , reliquasque civitates stipendiarias haberent . <end>$$When the war with the Helvetii was concluded , embassadors from almost all parts of Gaul , the chiefs of states , assembled to congratulate Caesar , that they were well aware , that , although he had taken vengeance on the Helvetii in war , for the old wrong done by them to the Roman people , yet that circumstance had happened no less to the benefit of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people , because the Helvetii , while their affairs were most flourishing , had quitted their country with the design of making war upon the whole of Gaul , and seizing the government of it , and selecting , out of a great abundance , that spot for an abode , which they should judge to be the most convenient and most productive of all Gaul , and hold the rest of the states as tributaries .
<start> Petierunt uti sibi concilium totius Galliae in diem certam indicere idque Caesaris facere voluntate liceret : sese habere quasdam res quas ex communi consensu ab eo petere vellent . <end>$$They requested that they might be allowed to proclaim an assembly of the whole of Gaul for a particular day , and to do that with Caesar's permission , that they had some things which , with the general consent , they wished to ask of him .
<start> Ea re permissa diem concilio constituerunt et iure iurando ne quis enuntiaret , nisi quibus communi consilio mandatum esset , inter se sanxerunt . <end>$$This request having been granted , they appointed a day for the assembly , and ordained by an oath with each other , that no one should disclose except those to whom this should be assigned by the general assembly .
<start> Eo concilio dimisso , idem principes civitatum qui ante fuerant ad Caesarem reverterunt petieruntque uti sibi secreto in occulto de sua omniumque salute cum eo agere liceret . <end>$$When that assembly was dismissed , the same chiefs of states , who had before been to Caesar , returned , and asked that they might be allowed to treat with him privately concerning the safety of themselves and of all .
<start> Ea re impetrata sese omnes flentes Caesari ad pedes proiecerunt : non minus se id contendere et laborare ne ea quae dixissent enuntiarentur quam uti ea quae vellent impetrarent , propterea quod , si enuntiatum esset , summum in cruciatum se venturos viderent . <end>$$That request having been obtained , they all threw themselves in tears at Caesar's feet , that they no less begged and earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed , than that they might obtain those things which they wished for ; inasmuch as they saw , that , if a disclosure was made , they should be put to the greatest tortures .
<start> Locutus est pro his Diviciacus Haeduus : Galliae totius factiones esse duas ; harum alterius principatum tenere Haeduos , alterius Arvernos . <end>$$For these Diviciacus the Aeduan spoke and told him : That there were two parties in the whole of Gaul : that the Aedui stood at the head of one of these , the Arverni of the other .
<start> Hi cum tantopere de potentatu inter se multos annos contenderent , factum esse uti ab Arvernis Sequanisque Germani mercede arcesserentur . <end>$$After these had been violently struggling with one another for the superiority for many years , it came to pass that the Germans were called in for hire by the Arverni and the Sequani .
<start> Horum primo circiter milia XV Rhenum transisse ; postea quam agros et cultum et copias Gallorum homines feri ac barbari adamassent , traductos plures ; nunc esse in Gallia ad C et XX milium numerum Cum his Haeduos eorumque clientes semel atque iterum armis contendisse ; magnam calamitatem pulsos accepisse , omnem nobilitatem , omnem senatum , omnem equitatum amisisse . <end>$$That about 15 , 000 of them had at first crossed the Rhine : but after that these wild and savage men had become enamored of the lands and the refinement and the abundance of the Gauls , more were brought over , that there were now as many as 120 , 000 of them in Gaul : that with these the Aedui and their dependents had repeatedly struggled in arms-that they had been routed , and had sustained a great calamity-had lost all their nobility , all their senate , all their cavalry .
<start> Quibus proeliis calamitatibusque fractos , qui et sua virtute et populi Romani hospitio atque amicitia plurimum ante in Gallia potuissent , coactos esse Sequanis obsides dare nobilissimos civitatis et iure iurando civitatem obstringere sese neque obsides repetituros neque auxilium a populo Romano imploraturos neque recusaturos quo minus perpetuo sub illorum dicione atque imperio essent . <end>$$And that broken by such engagements and calamities , although they had formerly been very powerful in Gaul , both from their own valor and from the Roman people's hospitality and friendship , they were now compelled to give the chief nobles of their state , as hostages to the Sequani , and to bind their state by an oath , that they would neither demand hostages in return , nor supplicate aid from the Roman people , nor refuse to be forever under their sway and empire .
<start> Unum se esse ex omni civitate Haeduorum qui adduci non potuerit ut iuraret aut liberos suos obsides daret . <end>$$That he was the only one out of all the state of the Aedui , who could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as hostages .
<start> Ob eam rem se ex civitate profugisse et Romam ad senatum venisse auxilium postulatum , quod solus neque iure iurando neque obsidibus teneretur . <end>$$On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the senate at Rome to beseech aid , as he alone was bound neither by oath nor hostages .
<start> Sed peius victoribus Sequanis quam Haeduis victis accidisse , propterea quod Ariovistus , rex Germanorum , in eorum finibus consedisset tertiamque partem agri Sequani , qui esset optimus totius Galliae , occupavisset et nunc de altera parte tertia Sequanos decedere iuberet , propterea quod paucis mensibus ante Harudum milia hominum XXIIII ad eum venissent , quibus locus ac sedes pararentur . <end>$$But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the vanquished Aedui , for Ariovistus the king of the Germans , had settled in their territories , and had seized upon a third of their land , which was the best in the whole of Gaul , and was now ordering them to depart from another third part , because a few months previously 24 , 000 men of the Harudes had come to him , for whom room and settlements must be provided .
<start> Futurum esse paucis annis uti omnes ex Galliae finibus pellerentur atque omnes Germani Rhenum transirent ; neque enim conferendum esse Gallicum cum Germanorum agro neque hanc consuetudinem victus cum illa comparandam . <end>$$The consequence would be , that in a few years they would all be driven from the territories of Gaul , and all the Germans would cross the Rhine ; for neither must the land of Gaul be compared with the land of the Germans , nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a level with that of the former .
<start> Ariovistum autem , ut semel Gallorum copias proelio vicerit , quod proelium factum sit ad Magetobrigam , superbe et crudeliter imperare , obsides nobilissimi cuiusque liberos poscere et in eos omnia exempla cruciatusque edere , si qua res non ad nutum aut ad voluntatem eius facta sit . <end>$$Moreover , Ariovistus , no sooner did he defeat the forces of the Gauls in a battle which took place at Magetobriga , than to lord it haughtily and cruelly , to demand as hostages the children of all the principal nobles , and wreak on them every kind of cruelty , if every thing was not done at his nod or pleasure ; that he was a savage , passionate , and reckless man , and that his commands could no longer be borne .
<start> Hominem esse barbarum , iracundum , temerarium : non posse eius imperia diutius sustineri Nisi quid in Caesare populoque Romano sit auxilii , omnibus Gallis idem esse faciendum quod Helvetii fecerint , ut domo emigrent , aliud domicilium , alias sedes , remotas a Germanis , petant fortunamque , quaecumque accidat , experiantur . <end>$$Unless there was some aid in Caesar and the Roman people , the Gauls must all do the same thing that the Helvetii have done , emigrate from their country , and seek another dwelling place , other settlements remote from the Germans , and try whatever fortune may fall to their lot .
<start> Haec si enuntiata Ariovisto sint , non dubitare quin de omnibus obsidibus qui apud eum sint gravissimum supplicium sumat Caesarem vel auctoritate sua atque exercitus vel recenti victoria vel nomine populi Romani deterrere posse ne maior multitudo Germanorum Rhenum traducatur , Galliamque omnem ab Ariovisti iniuria posse defendere . <end>$$If these things were to be disclosed to Ariovistus , that he doubts not that he would inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in his possession , that Caesar could , either by his own influence and by that of his army , or by his late victory , or by name of the Roman people , intimidate him , so as to prevent a greater number of Germans being brought over the Rhine , and could protect all Gaul from the outrages of Ariovistus .
<start> Hac oratione ab Diviciaco habita omnes qui aderant magno fletu auxilium a Caesare petere coeperunt . <end>$$When this speech had been delivered by Diviciacus , all who were present began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of Caesar .
<start> Animadvertit Caesar unos ex omnibus Sequanos nihil earum rerum facere quas ceteri facerent sed tristes capite demisso terram intueri . <end>$$Caesar noticed that the Sequani were the only people of all who did none of those things which the others did , but , with their heads bowed down , gazed on the earth in sadness .
<start> Eius rei quae causa esset miratus ex ipsis quaesiit . <end>$$Wondering what was the reason of this conduct , he inquired of themselves .
<start> Nihil Sequani respondere , sed in eadem tristitia taciti permanere . <end>$$No reply did the Sequani make , but silently continued in the same sadness .
<start> Cum ab his saepius quaereret neque ullam omnino vocem exprimere posset , idem Diviacus Haeduus respondit : hoc esse miseriorem et graviorem fortunam Sequanorum quam reliquorum , quod soli ne in occulto quidem queri neque auxilium implorare auderent absentisque Ariovisti crudelitatem , velut si coram adesset , horrerent , propterea quod reliquis tamen fugae facultas daretur , Sequanis vero , qui intra fines suos Ariovistum recepissent , quorum oppida omnia in potestate eius essent , omnes cruciatus essent perferendi . <end>$$When he had repeatedly inquired of them and could not elicit any answer at all , the same Diviciacus the Aeduan answered , that—the lot of the Sequani was more wretched and grievous than that of the rest , on this account , because they alone durst not even in secret complain or supplicate aid ; and shuddered at the cruelty of Ariovistus absent , just as if he were present ; for , to the rest , despite of every thing there was an opportunity of flight given ; but all tortures must be endured by the Sequani , who had admitted Ariovistus within their territories , and whose towns were all in his power .
<start> His rebus cognitis Caesar Gallorum animos verbis confirmavit pollicitusque est sibi eam rem curae futuram ; magnam se habere spem et beneficio suo et auctoritate adductum Ariovistum finem iniuriis facturum . <end>$$Caesar , on being informed of these things , cheered the minds of the Gauls with his words , and promised that this affair should be an object of his concern , that he had great hopes that Ariovistus , induced both by his kindness and his power , would put an end to his oppression .
<start> Et secundum ea multae res eum hortabantur quare sibi eam rem cogitandam et suscipiendam putaret , in primis quod Haeduos , fratres consanguineosque saepe numero a senatu appellatos , in servitute atque dicione videbat Germanorum teneri eorumque obsides esse apud Ariovistum ac Sequanos intellegebat ; quod in tanto imperio populi Romani turpissimum sibi et rei publicae esse arbitrabatur . <end>$$That , moreover , the Germans should by degrees become accustomed to cross the Rhine , and that a great body of them should come into Gaul , he saw dangerous to the Roman people , and judged , that wild and savage men would not be likely to restrain themselves , after they had possessed themselves of all Gaul , from going forth into the province and thence marching into Italy , particularly as the Rhône separated the Sequani from our province .
<start> Ipse autem Ariovistus tantos sibi spiritus , tantam arrogantiam sumpserat , ut ferendus non videretur . <end>$$Moreover , Ariovistus , for his part , had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance , that he was felt to be quite insufferable .
<start> Quam ob rem placuit ei ut ad Ariovistum legatos mitteret , qui ab eo postularent uti aliquem locum medium utrisque conloquio deligeret : velle sese de re publica et summis utriusque rebus cum eo agere . <end>$$He therefore determined to send embassadors to Ariovistus to demand of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between the two , that he wished to treat him on state-business and matters of the highest importance to both of them .
<start> Ei legationi Ariovistus respondit : si quid ipsi a Caesare opus esset , sese ad eum venturum fuisse ; si quid ille se velit , illum ad se venire oportere . <end>$$To this embassy Ariovistus replied , that if he himself had had need of any thing from Caesar , he would have gone to him ; and that if Caesar wanted any thing from him he ought to come to him .
<start> Praeterea se neque sine exercitu in eas partes Galliae venire audere quas Caesar possideret , neque exercitum sine magno commeatu atque molimento in unum locum contrahere posse Sibi autem mirum videri quid in sua Gallia , quam bello vicisset , aut Caesari aut omnino populo Romano negotii esset . <end>$$That , besides , neither dare he go without an army into those parts of Gaul which Caesar had possession of , nor could he , without great expense and trouble , draw his army together to one place ; that to him , moreover , it appeared strange , what business either Caesar or the Roman people at all had in his own Gaul , which he had conquered in war .
<start> Ad haec Ariovistus respondit : ius esse belli ut qui vicissent iis quos vicissent quem ad modum vellent imperarent Item populum Romanum victis non ad alterius praescriptum , sed ad suum arbitrium imperare consuesse . <end>$$To this Ariovistus replied , that the right of war was , that they who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered , in what manner they pleased ; that in that way the Roman people were wont to govern the nations which they had conquered , not according to the dictation of any other , but according to their own discretion .
<start> Si ipse populo Romano non praescriberet quem ad modum suo iure uteretur , non oportere se a populo Romano in suo iure impediri Haeduos sibi , quoniam belli fortunam temptassent et armis congressi ac superati essent , stipendiarios esse factos Magnam Caesarem iniuriam facere , qui suo adventu vectigalia sibi deteriora faceret Haeduis se obsides redditurum non esse neque his neque eorum sociis iniuria bellum inlaturum , si in eo manerent quod convenisset stipendiumque quotannis penderent ; si id non fecissent , longe iis fraternum nomen populi Romani afuturum . <end>$$If he for his part did not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner in which they were to exercise their right , he ought not to be obstructed by the Roman people in his right ; that the Aedui , inasmuch as they had tried the fortune of war and had engaged in arms and been conquered , had become tributaries to him ; that Caesar was doing a great injustice , in that by his arrival he was making his revenues less valuable to him ; that he should not restore their hostages to the Aedui , but should not make war wrongfully either upon them or their allies , if they abided by that which had been agreed on , and paid their tribute annually : if they did not continue to do that , the Roman people's name of 'brothers' would avail them naught .
<start> Quod sibi Caesar denuntiaret se Haeduorum iniurias non neglecturum , neminem secum sine sua pernicie contendisse . <end>$$As to Caesar's threatening him , that he would not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui , that no one had ever entered into a contest with him without utter ruin to himself .
<start> Cum vellet , congrederetur : intellecturum quid invicti Germani , exercitatissimi in armis , qui inter annos XIIII tectum non subissent , virtute possent . <end>$$That Caesar might enter the lists when he chose ; he would feel what the invincible Germans , well-trained beyond all others to arms , who for fourteen years had not been beneath a roof , could achieve by their valor .
<start> Haec eodem tempore Caesari mandata referebantur et legati ab Haeduis et a Treveris veniebant : Haedui questum quod Harudes , qui nuper in Galliam transportati essent , fines eorum popularentur : sese ne obsidibus quidem datis pacem Ariovisti redimere potuisse ; Treveri autem , pagos centum Sueborum ad ripas Rheni consedisse , qui Rhenum transire conarentur ; his praeesse Nasuam et Cimberium fratres . <end>$$At the same time that this message was delivered to Caesar , embassadors came from the Aedui and the Treviri ; from the Aedui to complain that the Harudes , who had lately been brought over into Gaul , were ravaging their territories ; that they had not been able to purchase peace from Ariovistus , even by giving hostages : and from the Treviri , that a hundred cantons of the Suevi had encamped on the banks of the Rhine , and were attempting to cross it ; that the brothers , Nasuas and Cimberius , headed them .
<start> Quibus rebus Caesar vehementer commotus maturandum sibi existimavit , ne , si nova manus Sueborum cum veteribus copiis Ariovisti sese coniunxisset , minus facile resisti posset . <end>$$Being greatly alarmed at these things , Caesar thought that he ought to use all dispatch , lest , if this new band of Suevi should unite with the old troops of Ariovistus , he might be less easily withstood .
<start> Itaque re frumentaria quam celerrime potuit comparata magnis itineribus ad Ariovistum contendit . <end>$$Having therefore , as quickly as he could , provided a supply of corn , he hastened to Ariovistus by forced marches .
<start> Cum tridui viam processisset , nuntiatum est ei Ariovistum cum suis omnibus copiis ad occupandum Vesontionem , quod est oppidum maximum Sequanorum , contendere  . <end>$$When he had proceeded three days' journey , word was brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on Vesontio , which is the largest town of the Sequani , and had advanced three days' journey from its territories .
<start> Huc Caesar magnis nocturnis diurnisque itineribus contendit occupatoque oppido ibi praesidium conlocat . <end>$$Hither Caesar hastens by forced marches by night and day , and , after having seized the town , stations a garrison there .
<start> Dum paucos dies ad Vesontionem rei frumentariae commeatusque causa moratur , ex percontatione nostrorum vocibusque Gallorum ac mercatorum , qui ingenti magnitudine corporum Germanos , incredibili virtute atque exercitatione in armis esse praedicabant (saepe numero sese cum his congressos ne vultum quidem atque aciem oculorum dicebant ferre potuisse) , tantus subito timor omnem exercitum occupavit ut non mediocriter omnium mentes animosque perturbaret . <end>$$While he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio , on account of corn and provisions ; from the inquiries of our men and the reports of the Gauls and traders —so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army , as to discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree .
<start> Hic primum ortus est a tribunis militum , praefectis , reliquisque qui ex urbe amicitiae causa Caesarem secuti non magnum in re militari usum habebant : quorum alius alia causa inlata , quam sibi ad proficiscendum necessariam esse diceret , petebat ut eius voluntate discedere liceret ; non nulli pudore adducti , ut timoris suspicionem vitarent , remanebant . <end>$$This first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers , the prefects and the rest , who , having followed Caesar from the city from motives of friendship , had no great experience in military affairs .
<start> Hi neque vultum fingere neque interdum lacrimas tenere poterant : abditi in tabernaculis aut suum fatum querebantur aut cum familiaribus suis commune periculum miserabantur . <end>$$And alleging , some of them one reason , some another , which they said made it necessary for them to depart , they requested that by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw ; some , influenced by shame , stayed behind in order that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice .
<start> Horum vocibus ac timore paulatim etiam ii qui magnum in castris usum habebant , milites centurionesque quique equitatui praeerant , perturbabantur . <end>$$By the expressions and cowardice of these men , even those who possessed great experience in the camp , both soldiers and centurions , and those who were in command of the cavalry , were gradually disconcerted .
<start> Qui se ex his minus timidos existimari volebant , non se hostem vereri , sed angustias itineris et magnitudinem silvarum quae intercederent inter ipsos atque Ariovistum , aut rem frumentariam , ut satis commode supportari posset , timere dicebant . <end>$$Such of them as wished to be considered less alarmed , said that they did not dread the enemy , but feared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests which lay between them and Ariovistus , or else that the supplies could not be brought up readily enough .
<start> Non nulli etiam Caesari nuntiabant , cum castra moveri ac signa ferri iussisset , non fore dicto audientes milites neque propter timorem signa laturos . <end>$$Some even declared to Caesar , that when he gave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops to advance , the soldiers would not be obedient to the command , nor advance in consequence of their fear .
<start> Haec cum animadvertisset , convocato consilio omniumque ordinum ad id consilium adhibitis centurionibus , vehementer eos incusavit : primum , quod aut quam in partem aut quo consilio ducerentur sibi quaerendum aut cogitandum putarent . <end>$$When Caesar observed these things , having called a council , and summoned to it the centurions of all the companies , he severely reprimanded them , particularly , for supposing that it belonged to them to inquire or conjecture , either in what direction they were marching , or with what object .
<start> Ariovistum se consule cupidissime populi Romani amicitiam adpetisse ; cur hunc tam temere quisquam ab officio discessurum iudicaret ? Sibi quidem persuaderi cognitis suis postulatis atque aequitate condicionum perspecta eum neque suam neque populi Romani gratiam repudiaturum . <end>$$That Ariovistus , during his consulship , had most anxiously sought after the friendship of the Roman people ; why should any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty ? He for his part was persuaded , that , when his demands were known and the fairness of the terms considered , he would reject neither his nor the Roman people's favor .
<start> Quod si furore atque amentia impulsum bellum intulisset , quid tandem vererentur ? Aut cur de sua virtute aut de ipsius diligentia desperarent ? Factum eius hostis periculum patrum nostrorum memoria Cimbris et Teutonis a Gaius Mario pulsis ; factum etiam nuper in Italia servili tumultu , quos tamen aliquid usus ac disciplina , quam a nobis accepissent , sublevarint . <end>$$But even if , driven on by rage and madness , he should make war upon them , what after all were they afraid of ? —or why should they despair either of their own valor or of his zeal ? Of that enemy a trial had been made within our fathers' recollection , when , on the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Gaius Marius , the army was regarded as having deserved no less praise than their commander himself .
<start> Ex quo iudicari posse quantum haberet in se boni constantia , propterea quod quos aliquam diu inermes sine causa timuissent hos postea armatos ac victores superassent . <end>$$It had been made lately , too , in Italy , during the rebellion of the slaves , whom , however , the experience and training which they had received from us , assisted in some respect .
<start> Denique hos esse eosdem Germanos quibuscum saepe numero Helvetii congressi non solum in suis sed etiam in illorum finibus plerumque superarint , qui tamen pares esse nostro exercitui non potuerint . <end>$$From which a judgment might be formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as those whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed , they had afterward vanquished , when well armed and flushed with success .
<start> Si quos adversum proelium et fuga Gallorum commoveret , hos , si quaererent , reperire posse diuturnitate belli defatigatis Gallis Ariovistum , cum multos menses castris se ac paludibus tenuisset neque sui potestatem fecisset , desperantes iam de pugna et dispersos subito adortum magis ratione et consilio quam virtute vicisse . <end>$$In short , that these were the same men whom the Helvetii , in frequent encounters , not only in their own territories , but also in theirs , have generally vanquished , and yet can not have been a match for our army .
<start> Qui suum timorem in rei frumentariae simulationem angustiasque itineris conferrent , facere arroganter , cum aut de officio imperatoris desperare aut praescribere viderentur . <end>$$That those who ascribed their fear to a pretense about the supplies and the narrowness of the roads , acted presumptuously , as they seemed either to distrust their general's discharge of his duty , or to dictate to him .
<start> Haec sibi esse curae ; frumentum Sequanos , Leucos , Lingones subministrare , iamque esse in agris frumenta matura ; de itinere ipsos brevi tempore iudicaturos . <end>$$That these things were his concern ; that the Sequani , the Leuci , and the Lingones were to furnish the corn ; and that it was already ripe in the fields ; that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves .
<start> Quod non fore dicto audientes neque signa laturi dicantur , nihil se ea re commoveri : scire enim , quibuscumque exercitus dicto audiens non fuerit , aut male re gesta fortunam defuisse aut aliquo facinore comperto avaritiam esse convictam . <end>$$As to its being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command , or advance , he was not at all disturbed at that ; for he knew , that in the case of all those whose army had not been obedient to command , either upon some mismanagement of an affair , fortune had deserted them , or , that upon some crime being discovered , covetousness had been clearly proved  .
<start> Suam innocentiam perpetua vita , felicitatem Helvetiorum bello esse perspectam . <end>$$His integrity had been seen throughout his whole life , his good fortune in the war with the Helvetii .
<start> Itaque se quod in longiorem diem conlaturus fuisset repraesentaturum et proxima nocte de quarta , vigilia castra moturum , ut quam primum intellegere posset utrum apud eos pudor atque officium an timor plus valeret . <end>$$That he would therefore instantly set about what he had intended to put off till a more distant day , and would break up his camp the next night , in the fourth watch , that he might ascertain , as soon as possible , whether a sense of honor and duty , or whether fear had more influence with them .
<start> Quod si praeterea nemo sequatur , tamen se cum sola decima legione iturum , de qua non dubitet , sibique eam praetoriam cohortem futuram . <end>$$But that , if no one else should follow , yet he would go with only the tenth legion , of which he had no misgivings , and it should be his praetorian cohort .
<start> Huic legioni Caesar et indulserat praecipue et propter virtutem confidebat maxime . <end>$$This legion Caesar had both greatly favored , and in it , on account of its valor , placed the greatest confidence .
<start> Hac oratione habita mirum in modum conversae sunt omnium mentes summaque alacritas et cupiditas belli gerendi innata est , princepsque X legio per tribunos militum ei gratias egit quod de se optimum iudicium fecisset , seque esse ad bellum gerendum paratissimam confirmavit . <end>$$Upon the delivery of this speech , the minds of all were changed in a surprising manner , and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecuting the war were engendered ; and the tenth legion was the first to return thanks to him , through their military tribunes , for his having expressed this most favorable opinion of them ; and assured him that they were quite ready to prosecute the war .
<start> Deinde reliquae legiones cum tribunis militum et primorum ordinum centurionibus egerunt uti Caesari satis facerent : se neque umquam dubitasse neque timuisse neque de summa belli suum iudicium sed imperatoris esse existimavisse . <end>$$Then , the other legions endeavored , through their military tribunes and the centurions of the principal companies , to excuse themselves to Caesar , that they had never either doubted or feared , or supposed that the determination of the conduct of the war was theirs and not their general's .
<start> Eorum satisfactione accepta et itinere exquisito per Diviciacum , quod ex Gallis ei maximam fidem habebat , ut milium amplius quinquaginta circuitu locis apertis exercitum duceret , de quarta vigilia , ut dixerat , profectus est . <end>$$Having accepted their excuse , and having had the road carefully reconnoitered by Diviciacus , because in him of all others he had the greatest faith that by a circuitous route of more than fifty miles he might lead his army through open parts ; he then set out in the fourth watch , as he had said  .
<start> Septimo die , cum iter non intermitteret , ab exploratoribus certior factus est Ariovisti copias a nostris milia passuum IIII et XX abesse . <end>$$On the seventh day , as he did not discontinue his march , he was informed by scouts that the forces of Ariovistus were only four and twenty miles distant from ours .
<start> Cognito Caesaris adventu Ariovistus legatos ad eum mittit : quod antea de conloquio postulasset , id per se fieri licere , quoniam propius accessisset seque id sine periculo facere posse existimaret . <end>$$Upon being apprized of Caesar's arrival , Ariovistus sends embassadors to him , that what he had before requested as to a conference , might now , as far as his permission went , take place , since he had approached nearer , and he considered that he might now do it without danger .
<start> Caesar , quod neque conloquium interposita causa tolli volebat neque salutem suam Gallorum equitatui committere audebat , commodissimum esse statuit omnibus equis Gallis equitibus detractis eo legionarios milites legionis X , cui quam maxime confidebat , imponere , ut praesidium quam amicissimum , si quid opus facto esset , haberet . <end>$$Meanwhile , as ambassadors were being often sent to and fro between them , Ariovistus demanded that Caesar should not bring any foot-soldier with him to the conference , that he was afraid of being ensnared by him through treachery ; that both should come accompanied by cavalry ; that he would not come on any other condition .
<start> Planities erat magna et in ea tumulus terrenus satis grandis . <end>$$There was a large plain , and in it a mound of earth of considerable size .
<start> Hic locus aequum fere spatium a castris Ariovisti et Caesaris aberat . <end>$$This spot was at nearly an equal distance from both camps .
<start> Eo , ut erat dictum , ad conloquium venerunt . <end>$$Thither , as had been appointed , they came for the conference .
<start> Legionem Caesar , quam equis devexerat , passibus CC ab eo tumulo constituit . <end>$$Caesar stationed the legion , which he had brought on horseback , 200 paces from this mound .
<start> Item equites Ariovisti pari intervallo constiterunt . <end>$$The cavalry of Ariovistus also took their stand at an equal distance .
<start> Ariovistus ex equis ut conloquerentur et praeter se denos ad conloquium adducerent postulavit . <end>$$Ariovistus then demanded that they should confer on horseback , and that , besides themselves , they should bring with them ten men each to the conference .
<start> Ubi eo ventum est , Caesar initio orationis sua senatusque in eum beneficia commemoravit , quod rex appellatus esset a senatu , quod amicus , quod munera amplissime missa ; quam rem et paucis contigisse et pro magnis hominum officiis consuesse tribui docebat ; illum , cum neque aditum neque causam postulandi iustam haberet , beneficio ac liberalitate sua ac senatus ea praemia consecutum . <end>$$When they were come to the place , Caesar , in the opening of his speech , detailed his own and the senate's favors toward him , in that he had been styled king , in that friend , by the senate-in that very considerable presents had been sent him ; which circumstance he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few , and had usually been bestowed in consideration of important personal services ; that he , although he had neither an introduction , nor a just ground for the request , had obtained these honors through the kindness and munificence of himself and the senate .
<start> Docebat etiam quam veteres quamque iustae causae necessitudinis ipsis cum Haeduis intercederent , quae senatus consulta quotiens quamque honorifica in eos facta essent , ut omni tempore totius Galliae principatum Haedui tenuissent , prius etiam quam nostram amicitiam adpetissent Populi Romani hanc esse consuetudinem , ut socios atque amicos non modo sui nihil deperdere , sed gratia , dignitate , honore auctiores velit esse ; quod vero ad amicitiam populi Romani attulissent , id iis eripi quis pati posset ? Postulavit deinde eadem quae legatis in mandatis dederat : ne aut Haeduis aut eorum sociis bellum inferret , obsides redderet , si nullam partem Germanorum domum remittere posset , at ne quos amplius Rhenum transire pateretur . <end>$$He informed him too , how old and how just were the grounds of connection that existed between themselves and the Aedui , what decrees of the senate had been passed in their favor , and how frequent and how honorable ; how from time immemorial the Aedui had held the supremacy of the whole of Gaul ; even before they had sought our friendship ; that it was the custom of the Roman people to desire not only that its allies and friends should lose none of their property , but be advanced in influence , dignity , and honor : who then could endure that what they had brought with them to the friendship of the Roman people should be torn from them ? He then made the same demands which he had commissioned the embassadors to make , that should not make war either upon the Aedui or their allies , that he should restore the hostages ; that if he could not send back to their country any part of the Germans , he should at all events suffer none of them any more to cross the Rhine .
<start> Ariovistus ad postulata Caesaris pauca respondit , de suis virtutibus multa praedicavit : transisse Rhenum sese non sua sponte , sed rogatum et arcessitum a Gallis ; non sine magna spe magnisque praemiis domum propinquosque reliquisse ; sedes habere in Gallia ab ipsis concessas , obsides ipsorum voluntate datos ; stipendium capere iure belli , quod victores victis imponere consuerint Non sese Gallis sed Gallos sibi bellum intulisse : omnes Galliae civitates ad se oppugnandum venisse ac contra se castra habuisse ; eas omnes copias a se uno proelio pulsas ac superatas esse . <end>$$Ariovistus briefly replied to the demands of Caesar ; but expatiated largely on his own virtues , that he had crossed the Rhine not of his own accord , but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls ; that he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and great rewards ; that he had settlements in Gaul , granted by the Gauls themselves ; that the hostages had been given by their good-will ; that he took by right of war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered ; that he had not made war upon the Gauls , but the Gauls upon him ; that all the states of Gaul came to attack him , and had encamped against him ; that all their forces had been routed and beaten by him in a single battle ; that if they chose to make a second trial , he was ready to encounter them again ; but if they chose to enjoy peace , it was unfair to refuse the tribute , which of their own free-will they had paid up to that time .
<start> Si iterum experiri velint , se iterum paratum esse decertare ; si pace uti velint , iniquum esse de stipendio recusare , quod sua voluntate ad id tempus pependerint . <end>$$That the friendship of the Roman people ought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard , not a detriment ; and that he sought it with that expectation .
<start> Amicitiam populi Romani sibi ornamento et praesidio , non detrimento esse oportere , atque se hac spe petisse . <end>$$But if through the Roman people the tribute was to be discontinued , and those who surrendered to be seduced from him , he would renounce the friendship of the Roman people no less heartily than he had sought it .
<start> Si per populum Romanum stipendium remittatur et dediticii subtrahantur , non minus libenter sese recusaturum populi Romani amicitiam quam adpetierit . <end>$$As to his leading over a host of Germans into Gaul , that he was doing this with a view of securing himself , not of assaulting Gaul : that there was evidence of this , in that he did not come without being invited , and in that he did not make war , but merely warded it off .
<start> Quid sibi vellet ? Cur in suas possessiones veniret ? Provinciam suam hanc esse Galliam , sicut illam nostram . <end>$$That never before this time did a Roman army go beyond the frontiers of the province of Gaul .
<start> Ut ipsi concedi non oporteret , si in nostros fines impetum faceret , sic item nos esse iniquos , quod in suo iure se interpellaremus . <end>$$What does desire ? —why come into his domains ? —that this was his province of Gaul , just as that is ours .
<start> Quod fratres a senatu Haeduos appellatos diceret , non se tam barbarum neque tam imperitum esse rerum ut non sciret neque bello Allobrogum proximo Haeduos Romanis auxilium tulisse neque ipsos in iis contentionibus quas Haedui secum et cum Sequanis habuissent auxilio populi Romani usos esse . <end>$$As it ought not to be pardoned in him , if he were to make an attack upon our territories ; so , likewise , that we were unjust , to obstruct him in his prerogative .
<start> Qui nisi decedat atque exercitum deducat ex his regionibus , sese illum non pro amico sed pro hoste habiturum . <end>$$He must feel suspicious , that Caesar , though feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in Gaul , was keeping it with the view of crushing him .
<start> Quod si eum interfecerit , multis sese nobilibus principibusque populi Romani gratum esse facturum (id se ab ipsis per eorum nuntios compertum habere) , quorum omnium gratiam atque amicitiam eius morte redimere posset . <end>$$And that unless he depart and withdraw his army from these parts , he shall regard him not as a friend , but as a foe ; and that , even if he should put him to death , he should do what would please many of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people ; he had assurance of that from themselves through their messengers , and could purchase the favor and the friendship of them all by his death .
<start> Quod si decessisset et liberam possessionem Galliae sibi tradidisset , magno se illum praemio remuneraturum et quaecumque bella geri vellet sine ullo eius labore et periculo confecturum . <end>$$But if he would depart and resign to him the free possession of Gaul , he would recompense him with a great reward , and would bring to a close whatever wars he wished to be carried on , without any trouble or risk to him .
<start> Multa a Caesare in eam sententiam dicta sunt quare negotio desistere non posset : neque suam neque populi Romani consuetudinem pati ut optime meritos socios desereret , neque se iudicare Galliam potius esse Ariovisti quam populi Romani Bello superatos esse Arvernos et Rutenos a Quintus Fabio Maximo , quibus populus Romanus ignovisset neque in provinciam redegisset neque stipendium posuisset . <end>$$Many things were stated by Caesar to the effect ; why he could not waive the business , and that neither his nor the Roman people's practice would suffer him to abandon most meritorious allies , nor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather than to the Roman people ; that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued in war by Quintus Fabius Maximus , and that the Roman people had pardoned them and had not reduced them into a province or imposed a tribute upon them .
<start> Quod si antiquissimum quodque tempus spectari oporteret , populi Romani iustissimum esse in Gallia imperium ; si iudicium senatus observari oporteret , liberam debere esse Galliam , quam bello victam suis legibus uti voluisset . <end>$$And if the most ancient period was to be regarded-then was the sovereignty of the Roman people in Gaul most just : if the decree of the Senate was to be observed , then ought Gaul to be free , which they had conquered in war , and had permitted to enjoy its own laws .
<start> Dum haec in conloquio geruntur , Caesari nuntiatum est equites Ariovisti propius tumulum accedere et ad nostros adequitare , lapides telaque in nostros coicere . <end>$$While these things are being transacted in the conference it was announced to Caesar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were approaching nearer the mound , and were riding up to our men , and casting stones and weapons at them .
<start> Caesar loquendi finem fecit seque ad suos recepit suisque imperavit ne quod omnino telum in hostes reicerent . <end>$$Caesar made an end of his speech and betook himself to his men ; and commanded them that they should by no means return a weapon upon the enemy .
<start> Nam etsi sine ullo periculo legionis delectae cum equitatu proelium fore videbat , tamen committendum non putabat ut , pulsis hostibus , dici posset eos ab se per fidem in conloquio circumventos . <end>$$For though he saw that an engagement with the cavalry would be without any danger to his chosen legion , yet he did not think proper to engage , lest , after the enemy were routed , it might be said that they had been insnared by him under the sanction of a conference .
<start> Postea quam in vulgus militum elatum est qua arrogantia in conloquio Ariovistus usus omni Gallia Romanis interdixisset , impetumque in nostros eius equites fecissent , eaque res conloquium ut diremisset , multo maior alacritas studiumque pugnandi maius exercitui iniectum est . <end>$$When it was spread abroad among the common soldiery with what haughtiness Ariovistus had behaved at the conference , and how he had ordered the Romans to quit Gaul , and how his cavalry had made an attack upon our men , and how this had broken off the conference , a much greater alacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into our army .
<start> Biduo post Ariovistus ad Caesarem legatos misit : velle se de iis rebus quae inter eos egi coeptae neque perfectae essent agere cum eo : uti aut iterum conloquio diem constitueret aut , si id minus vellet , ex suis legatis aliquem ad se mitteret . <end>$$Two days after , Ariovistus sends embassadors to Caesar , to state that he wished to treat with him about those things which had been begun to be treated of between them , but had not been concluded ; that he would either again appoint a day for a conference ; or , if he were not willing to do that , that he would send one of his as an embassador to him .
<start> Conloquendi Caesari causa visa non est , et eo magis quod pridie eius diei Germani retineri non potuerant quin tela in nostros coicerent . <end>$$There did not appear to Caesar any good reason for holding a conference ; and the more so as the day before the Germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men .
<start> Legatum ex suis sese magno cum periculo ad eum missurum et hominibus feris obiecturum existimabat . <end>$$He thought he should not without great danger send to him as embassador one of his officers , and should expose him to savage men .
<start> Commodissimum visum est Gaius Valerium Procillum , Gaius Valerii Caburi filium , summa virtute et humanitate adulescentem , cuius pater a Gaius Valerio Flacco civitate donatus erat , et propter fidem et propter linguae Gallicae scientiam , qua multa iam Ariovistus longinqua consuetudine utebatur , et quod in eo peccandi Germanis causa non esset , ad eum mittere , et una Marcus Metium , qui hospitio Ariovisti utebatur . <end>$$It seemed most proper to send to him Gaius Valerius Procillus , the son of Gaius Valerius Caburus , a young man of the highest courage and accomplishments , both on account of his fidelity and on account of his knowledge of the Gallic language , which Ariovistus , by long practice , now spoke fluently ; and because in his case the Germans would have no motive for committing violence ; and Marcus Mettius , who had shared the hospitality of Ariovistus .
<start> His mandavit quae diceret Ariovistus cognogcerent et ad se referrent . <end>$$He commissioned them to learn what Ariovistus had to say , and to report to him .
<start> Quos cum apud se in castris Ariovistus conspexisset , exercitu suo praesente conclamavit : quid ad se venirent ? an speculandi causa ? Conantes dicere prohibuit et in catenas coniecit . <end>$$But when Ariovistus saw them before him in his camp , he cried out in the presence of his army , Why were they come to him ? Was it for the purpose of acting as spies ? He stopped them when attempting to speak , and cast them into chains .
<start> Eodem die castra promovit et milibus passuum VI a Caesaris castris sub monte consedit . <end>$$The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill six miles from Caesar's camp .
<start> Postridie eius diei praeter castra Caesaris suas copias traduxit et milibus passuum duobus ultra eum castra fecit eo consilio uti frumento commeatuque qui ex Sequanis et Haeduis supportaretur Caesarem intercluderet . <end>$$The day following he led his forces past Caesar's camp , and encamped two miles beyond him ; with this design that he might cut off Caesar from the corn and provisions , which might be conveyed to him from the Sequani and the Aedui .
<start> Ex eo die dies continuos V Caesar pro castris suas copias produxit et aciem instructam habuit , ut , si vellet Ariovistus proelio contendere , ei potestas non deesset . <end>$$For five successive days from that day , Caesar drew out his forces before the camp , and put them in battle order , that , if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in battle , an opportunity might not be wanting to him .
<start> Ariovistus his omnibus diebus exercitum castris continuit , equestri proelio cotidie contendit . <end>$$Ariovistus all this time kept his army in camp : but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes .
<start> Genus hoc erat pugnae , quo se Germani exercuerant : equitum milia erant VI , totidem numero pedites velocissimi ac fortissimi , quos ex omni copia singuli singulos suae salutis causa delegerant : cum his in proeliis versabantur , ad eos se equites recipiebant ; hi , si quid erat durius , concurrebant , si qui graviore vulnere accepto equo deciderat , circumsistebant ; si quo erat longius prodeundum aut celerius recipiendum , tanta erat horum exercitatione celeritas ut iubis sublevati equorum cursum adaequarent . <end>$$The method of battle in which the Germans had practiced themselves was this There were 6 , 000 horse , and as many very active and courageous foot , one of whom each of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own protection By these they were constantly accompanied in their engagements ; to these the horse retired ; these on any emergency rushed forward ; if any one , upon receiving a very severe wound , had fallen from his horse , they stood around him : if it was necessary to advance further than usual , or to retreat more rapidly , so great , from practice , was their swiftness , that , supported by the manes of the horses , they could keep pace with their speed .
<start> Ubi eum castris se tenere Caesar intellexit , ne diutius commeatu prohiberetur , ultra eum locum , quo in loco Germani consederant , circiter passus DC ab his , castris idoneum locum delegit acieque triplici instructa ad eum locum venit . <end>$$Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in camp , Caesar , that he might not any longer be cut off from provisions , chose a convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans had encamped , at about 600 paces from them , and having drawn up his army in three lines , marched to that place .
<start> Primam et secundam aciem in armis esse , tertiam castra munire iussit . <end>$$This place was distant from the enemy about 600 paces , as has been stated .
<start> Eo circiter hominum XVI milia expedita cum omni equitatu Ariovistus misit , quae copiae nostros terrerent et munitione prohiberent . <end>$$Thither Ariovistus sent light troops , about 16 , 000 men in number , with all his cavalry ; which forces were to intimidate our men , and hinder them in their fortification .
<start> Nihilo setius Caesar , ut ante constituerat , duas acies hostem propulsare , tertiam opus perficere iussit . <end>$$Caesar nevertheless , as he had before arranged , ordered two lines to drive off the enemy : the third to execute the work .
<start> Proximo die instituto suo Caesar ex castris utrisque copias suas eduxit paulumque a maioribus castris progressus aciem instruxit hostibusque pugnandi potestatem fecit . <end>$$The next day , according to his custom , Caesar led out his forces from both camps , and having advanced a little from the larger one , drew up his line of battle , and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting .
<start> Ubi ne tum quidem eos prodire intellexit , circiter meridiem exercitum in castra reduxit . <end>$$When he found that they did not even then come out he led back his army into camp about noon .
<start> Tum demum Ariovistus partem suarum copiarum , quae castra minora oppugnaret , misit . <end>$$Then at last Ariovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp .
<start> Acriter utrimque usque ad vesperum pugnatum est . <end>$$The battle was vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening .
<start> Solis occasu suas copias Ariovistus multis et inlatis et acceptis vulneribus in castra reduxit . <end>$$At sunset , after many wounds had been inflicted and received , Ariovistus led back his forces into camp .
<start> Cum ex captivis quaereret Caesar quam ob rem Ariovistus proelio non decertaret , hanc reperiebat causam , quod apud Germanos ea consuetudo esset ut matres familiae eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus declararent utrum proelium committi ex usu esset necne ; eas ita dicere : non esse fas Germanos superare , si ante novam lunam proelio contendissent . <end>$$When Caesar inquired of his prisoners , wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement , he discovered this to be the reason-that among the Germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and divination , whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not ; that they had said , that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer , if they engaged in battle before the new moon .
<start> Postridie eius diei Caesar praesidio utrisque castris quod satis esse visum est reliquit , alarios omnes in conspectu hostium pro castris minoribus constituit , quod minus multitudine militum legionariorum pro hostium numero valebat , ut ad speciem alariis uteretur ; ipse triplici instructa acie usque ad castra hostium accessit . <end>$$The day following , Caesar left what seemed sufficient as a guard for both camps ; drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the enemy , before the lesser camp , because he was not very powerful in the number of legionary soldiers , considering the number of the enemy ; that he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance .
<start> Tum demum necessario Germani suas copias castris eduxerunt generatimque constituerunt paribus intervallis , Harudes , Marcomanos , Tribocos , Vangiones , Nemetes , Sedusios , Suebos , omnemque aciem suam raedis et carris circumdederunt , ne qua spes in fuga relinqueretur . <end>$$He himself , having drawn up his army in three lines , advanced to the camp of the enemy Then at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces out of camp , and disposed them canton by canton , at equal distances , the Harudes , Marcomanni , Tribocci , Vangiones , Nemetes , Sedusii , Suevi ; and surrounded their whole army with their chariots and wagons , that no hope might be left in flight .
<start> Eo mulieres imposuerunt , quae ad proelium proficiscentes milites passis manibus flentes implorabant ne se in servitutem Romanis traderent . <end>$$On these they placed their women , who , with disheveled hair and in tears , entreated the soldiers , as they went forward to battle , not to deliver them into slavery to the Romans .
<start> Caesar singulis legionibus singulos legatos et quaestorem praefecit , uti eos testes suae quisque virtutis haberet ; ipse a dextro cornu , quod eam partem minime firmam hostium esse animadverterat , proelium commisit . <end>$$Caesar appointed over each legion a legate and a quaestor , that every one might have them as witnesses of his valor .
<start> Ita nostri acriter in hostes signo dato impetum fecerunt itaque hostes repente celeriterque procurrerunt , ut spatium pila in hostes coiciendi non daretur . <end>$$He himself began the battle at the head of the right wing , because he had observed that part of the enemy to be the least strong .
<start> At Germani celeriter ex consuetudine sua phalange facta impetus gladiorum exceperunt . <end>$$But the Germans , according to their custom , rapidly forming a phalanx , sustained the attack of our swords .
<start> Reperti sunt complures nostri qui in phalanga insilirent et scuta manibus revellerent et desuper vulnerarent . <end>$$There were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the phalanx , and with their hands tore away the shields , and wounded the enemy from above .
<start> Cum hostium acies a sinistro cornu pulsa atque in fugam coniecta esset , a dextro cornu vehementer multitudine suorum nostram aciem premebant . <end>$$Although the army of the enemy was routed on the left wing and put to flight , they pressed heavily on our men from the right wing , by the great number of their troops .
<start> Id cum animadvertisset Publius Crassus adulescens , qui equitatui praeerat , quod expeditior erat quam ii qui inter aciem versabantur , tertiam aciem laborantibus nostris subsidio misit . <end>$$On observing which , Publius Crassus , a young man , who commanded the cavalry—as he was more disengaged than those who were employed in the fight-sent the third line as a relief to our men who were in distress .
<start> Ita proelium restitutum est , atque omnes hostes terga verterunt nec prius fugere destiterunt quam ad flumen Rhenum milia passuum ex eo loco circiter L pervenerunt . <end>$$Thereupon the engagement was renewed , and all the enemy turned their backs , nor did they cease to flee until they arrived at the river Rhine , about fifty miles from that place .
<start> Ibi perpauci aut viribus confisi tranare contenderunt aut lintribus inventis sibi salutem reppererunt . <end>$$There some few , either relying on their strength , endeavored to swim over , or , finding boats , procured their safety .
<start> In his fuit Ariovistus , qui naviculam deligatam ad ripam nactus ea profugit ; reliquos omnes consecuti equites nostri interfecerunt . <end>$$Among the latter was Ariovistus , who meeting with a small vessel tied to the bank , escaped in it ; our horse pursued and slew all the rest of them .
<start> Duae fuerunt Ariovisti uxores , una Sueba natione , quam domo secum eduxerat , altera Norica , regis Voccionis soror , quam in Gallia duxerat a fratre missam : utraque in ea fuga periit ; duae filiae : harum altera occisa , altera capta est . <end>$$Ariovistus had two wives , one a Suevan by nation , whom he brought with him from home ; the other a Norican , the sister of king Vocion , whom he had married in Gaul , she having been sent by her brother .
<start> Gaius Valerius Procillus , cum a custodibus in fuga trinis catenis vinctus traheretur , in ipsum Caesarem hostes equitatu insequentem incidit . <end>$$Both perished in that flight Of their two daughters , one was slain , the other captured .
<start> Quae quidem res Caesari non minorem quam ipsa victoria voluptatem attulit , quod hominem honestissimum provinciae Galliae , suum familiarem et hospitem , ereptum ex manibus hostium sibi restitutum videbat neque eius calamitate de tanta voluptate et gratulatione quicquam fortuna deminuerat . <end>$$Gaius Valerius Procillus , as he was being dragged by his guards in the fight , bound with a triple chain , fell into the hands of Caesar himself , as he was pursuing the enemy with his cavalry .
<start> Item Marcus Metius repertus et ad eum reductus est . <end>$$Marcus Mettius , also , was found and brought back to him .
<start> Hoc proelio trans Rhenum nuntiato , Suebi , qui ad ripas Rheni venerant , domum reverti coeperunt ; quos ubi qui proximi Rhenum incolunt perterritos senserunt , insecuti magnum ex iis numerum occiderunt . <end>$$This battle having been reported beyond the Rhine , the Suevi , who had come to the banks of that river , began to return home , when the Ubii , who dwelt nearest to the Rhine , pursuing them , while much alarmed , slew a great number of them .
<start> Cum esset Caesar in citeriore Gallia , ita uti supra demonstravimus , crebri ad eum rumores adferebantur litterisque item Labieni certior fiebat omnes Belgas , quam tertiam esse Galliae partem dixeramus , contra populum Romanum coniurare obsidesque inter se dare Coniurandi has esse causas : primum quod vererentur ne , omni pacata Gallia , ad eos exercitus noster adduceretur ; deinde quod ab non nullis Gallis sollicitarentur , partim qui , ut Germanos diutius in Gallia versari noluerant , ita populi Romani exercitum hiemare atque inveterascere in Gallia moleste ferebant , partim qui mobilitate et levitate animi novis imperiis studebant ; ab non nullis etiam quod in Gallia a potentioribus atque iis qui ad conducendos homines facultates habebant vulgo regna occupabantur ; qui minus facile eam rem imperio nostro consequi poterant . <end>$$While Caesar was in winter quarters in Hither Gaul , as we have shown above , frequent reports were brought to him , and he was also informed by letters from Labienus , that all the Belgae , who we have said are a third part of Gaul , were entering into a confederacy against the Roman people , and giving hostages to one another ; that the reasons of the confederacy were these-first , because they feared that , after all Gaul was subdued , our army would be led against them ; secondly , because they were instigated by several of the Gauls ; some of whom as they had been unwilling that the Germans should remain any longer in Gaul , so they were dissatisfied that the army of the Roman people should pass the winter in it , and settle there ; and others of them , from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition , were anxious for a revolution ; by several , also , because the government in Gaul was generally seized upon by the more powerful persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops , and they could less easily effect this object under our dominion .
<start> His nuntiis litterisque commotus Caesar duas legiones in citeriore Gallia novas conscripsit et inita aestate in ulteriorem Galliam qui deduceret Quintus Pedium legatum misit . <end>$$Alarmed by these tidings and letters , Caesar levied two new legions in Hither Gaul , and , at the beginning of summer , sent Quintus Pedius , his legate , to conduct them further into Gaul .
<start> Ipse , cum primum pabuli copia esse inciperet , ad exercitum venit . <end>$$He , himself , as soon as there began to be plenty of forage , came to the army .
<start> Dat negotium Senonibus reliquisque Gallis qui finitimi Belgis erant uti ea quae apud eos gerantur cognoscant seque de his rebus certiorem faciant . <end>$$He gives a commission to the Senones and the other Gauls who were neighbors of the Belgae , to learn what is going on among them , and inform him of these matters .
<start> Hi constanter omnes nuntiaverunt manus cogi , exercitum in unum locum conduci . <end>$$These all uniformly reported that troops were being raised , and that an army was being collected in one place .
<start> Tum vero dubitandum non existimavit quin ad eos proficisceretur Re frumentaria provisa castra movet diebusque circiter XV ad fines Belgarum pervenit . <end>$$Then , indeed , he thought that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding toward them , and having provided supplies , moves his camp , and in about fifteen days arrives at the territories of the Belgae .
<start> Eo cum de improviso celeriusque omnium opinione venisset , Remi , qui proximi Galliae ex Belgis sunt , ad eum legatos Iccium et Andebrogium , primos civitatis , miserunt , qui dicerent se suaque omnia in fidem atque potestatem populi Romani permittere , neque se cum reliquis Belgis consensisse neque contra populum Romanum coniurasse , paratosque esse et obsides dare et imperata facere et oppidis recipere et frumento ceterisque rebus iuvare ; reliquos omnes Belgas in armis esse , Germanosque qui cis Rhenum incolant sese cum his coniunxisse , tantumque esse eorum omnium furorem ut ne Suessiones quidem , fratres consanguineosque suos , qui eodem iure et isdem legibus utantur , unum imperium unumque magistratum cum ipsis habeant , deterrere potuelint quin cum iis consentirent . <end>$$As he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner than any one anticipated , the Remi , who are the nearest of the Belgae to Gaul , sent to him Iccius and Andecombogius , the principal persons of the state , as their embassadors : to tell him that they surrendered themselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of the Roman people : and that they had neither combined with the rest of the Belgae , nor entered into any confederacy against the Roman people : and were prepared to give hostages , to obey his commands , to receive him into their towns , and to aid him with corn and other things ; that all the rest of the Belgae were in arms ; and that the Germans , who dwell on this side of the Rhine , had joined themselves to them ; and that so great was the infatuation of them all , that they could not restrain even the Suessiones , their own brethren and kinsmen , who enjoy the same rights , and the , same laws , and who have one government and one magistracy with themselves , from uniting with them .
<start> Cum ab iis quaereret quae civitates quantaeque in armis essent et quid in bello possent , sic reperiebat : plerosque Belgos esse ortos a Germanis Rhenumque antiquitus traductos propter loci fertilitatem ibi consedisse Gallosque qui ea loca incolerent expulisse , solosque esse qui , patrum nostrorum memoria omni Gallia vexata , Teutonos Cimbrosque intra suos fines ingredi prohibuerint ; qua ex re fieri uti earum rerum memoria magnam sibi auctoritatem Illagnosque spiritus in re militari sumerent . <end>$$When Caesar inquired of them what states were in arms , how powerful they were , and what they could do , in war , he received the following information : that the greater part of the Belgae were sprung from the Germans , and that having crossed the Rhine at an early period , they had settled there , on account of the fertility of the country , and had driven out the Gauls who inhabited those regions ; and that they were the only people who , in the memory of our fathers , when all Gaul was overrun , had prevented the Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their territories ; the effect of which was , that , from the recollection of those events , they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness in military matters .
<start> De numero eorum omnia se habere explorata Remi dicebant , propterea quod propinquitatibus adfinitatibus quo coniuncti quantam quisque multitudinem in communi Belgarum concilio ad id bellum pollicitus sit cognoverint . <end>$$The Remi said , that they had known accurately every thing respecting their number , because being united to them by neighborhood and by alliances , they had learned what number each state had in the general council of the Belgae promised for that war .
<start> Plurimum inter eos Bellovacos et virtute et auctoritate et hominum numero valere : hos posse conficere armata milia centum , pollicitos ex eo numero electa milia LX totiusque belli imperium sibi postulare . <end>$$That the Bellovaci were the most powerful among them in valor , influence , and the number of men ; that these could muster 100 , 000 armed men , promised 60 , 000 picked men out of that number , and demanded for themselves the command of the whole war .
<start> Suessiones suos esse finitimos ; fines latissimos teracissimosque agros possidere Apud eos fuisse regem nostra etiam memoria Diviciacum , totius Galliae potentissimum , qui cum magnae partis harum regionum , tum etiam Britanniae imperium obtinuerit ; nunc esse regem Galbam : ad hunc propter iustitiam prudentiamque summam totius belli omnium voluntate deferri ; oppida habere numero XII , polliceri milia armata L ; totidem Nervios , qui maxime feri inter ipsos habeantur longissimeque absint ; XV milia Atrebates , Ambianos X milia , Morinos XXV milia , Menapios VII milia , Caletos X milia , Veliocasses et Viromanduos totidem , Atuatucos XVIIII milia ; Condrusos , Eburones , Caerosos , Paemanos , qui uno nomine Germani appellantur , arbitrari ad XL milia . <end>$$That the Suessiones were their nearest neighbors and possessed a very extensive and fertile country ; that among them , even in our own memory , Diviciacus , the most powerful man of all Gaul , had been king ; who had held the government of a great part of these regions , as well as of Britain ; that their king at present was Galba ; that the direction of the whole war was conferred by the consent of all , upon him , on account of his integrity and prudence ; that they had twelve towns ; that they had promised 50 , 000 armed men ; and that the Nervii , who are reckoned the most warlike among them , and are situated at a very great distance , as many ; the Atrebates 15 , 000 ; the Ambiani , 10 , 000 ; the Morini , 25 , 000 ; the Menapii , 9 , 000 ; the Caleti , 10 , 000 ; the Veliocasses and the Viromandui as many ; the Aduatuci 19 , 000 ; that the Condrusi , the Eburones , the Caeraesi , the Paemani , who are called by the common name of Germans , they thought , to the number of 40 , 000 .
<start> Caesar Remos cohortatus liberaliterque oratione prosecutus omnem senatum ad se convenire principumque liberos obsides ad se adduci iussit . <end>$$Caesar , having encouraged the Remi , and addressed them courteously , ordered the whole senate to assemble before him , and the children of their chief men to be brought to him as hostages ; all which commands they punctually performed by the day  .
<start> Quae omnia ab his diligenter ad diem facta sunt Ipse Diviciacum Haeduum magnopere cohortatus docet quanto opere rei publicae comnlunisque salutis intersit manus hostium distineri , ne cum tanta multitudine uno tempore confligendum sit . <end>$$He , addressing himself to Diviciacus , the Aeduan , with great earnestness , points out how much it concerns the republic and their common security , that the forces of the enemy should be divided , so that it might not be necessary to engage with so large a number at one time .
<start> Id fieri posse , si suas copias Haedui in fines Bellovacorum introduxerint et eorum agros populari coeperint . <end>$$that this might be affected if the Aedui would lead their forces into the territories of the Bellovaci , and begin to lay waste their country .
<start> His datis\rangle mandatis eum a se dimittit . <end>$$With these instructions he dismissed him from his presence .
<start> Postquam omnes Belgarum copias in unum locum coactas ad se venire vidit neque iam longe abesse ab iis quos miserat exploratoribus et ab Remis cognovit , flumen Axonam , quod est in extremis Remorum finibus , exercitum traducere maturavit atque ibi castra posuit . <end>$$After he perceived that all the forces of the Belgae , which had been collected in one place , were approaching toward him , and learned from the scouts whom he had sent out , and from the Remi , that they were then not far distant , he hastened to lead his army over the Aisne , which is on the borders of the Remi , and there pitched his camp .
<start> Quae res et latus ullum castrorum ripis fluminis muniebat et post eum quae erant tuta ab hostibus reddebat et commeatus ab Remis reliquisque civitatibus ut sine periculo ad eum portari possent efficiebat . <end>$$This position fortified one side of his camp by the banks of the river , rendered the country which lay in his rear secure from the enemy , and furthermore insured that provisions might without danger be brought to him by the Remi and the rest of the states .
<start> Ibi praesidium ponit et in altera parte fluminis QuintusTiturium Sabinum legatum cum sex cohortibus relinquit ; castra in altitudinem pedum XII vallo fossaque duodeviginti pedum muniri iubet . <end>$$He orders him to fortify a camp with a rampart twelve feet in height , and a trench eighteen feet in breadth .
<start> Ab his castris oppidum Remorum nomine Bibrax aberat milia passuum VIII . <end>$$There was a town of the Remi , by name Bibrax , eight miles distant from this camp .
<start> Id ex itinere magno impetu Belgae oppugnare coeperunt . <end>$$This the Belgae on their march began to attack with great vigor .
<start> Aegre eo die sustentatum est . <end>$$was with difficulty sustained for that day .
<start> Gallorum eadem atque Belgarum oppugnatio est haec : ubi circumiecta multitudine hominum totis moenibus undique in murum lapides iaci coepti sunt murusque defensoribus nudatus est , testudine facta portas succedunt murumque subruunt Quod tum facile fiebat . <end>$$The Gauls' mode of besieging is the same as that of the Belgae : when after having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the fortifications , stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all sides , and the wall has been stripped of its defenders , , forming a testudo , they advance to the gates and undermine the wall : which was easily effected on this occasion ; for while so large a number were casting stones and darts , no one was able to maintain his position upon the wall .
<start> Nam cum tanta multitudo lapides ac tela coicerent , in muro consistendi potestas erat nulli Cum finem oppugnandi nox fecisset , Iccius Remus , summa nobilitate et gratia inter suos , qui tum oppido praeerat , unus ex iis qui legati de pace ad Caesarem venerant , nuntium ad eum mittit , nisi subsidium sibi submittatur , sese diutius sustinere non posse . <end>$$When night had put an end to the assault , Iccius Remus , who was then in command of the town , one of the Remi , a man of the highest rank and influence among his people , and one of those who had come to Caesar as embassador for peace , sends messengers to him , That , unless assistance were sent to him he could not hold out any longer .
<start> Eo de media nocte Caesar isdem ducibus usus qui nuntii ab Iccio venerant , Numidas et Cretas sagittarios et funditores Baleares subsidio oppidanis mittit ; quorum adventu et Remis cum spe delensionis studium propugnandi accessit et hostibus eadem de causa spes potiundi oppidi discessit . <end>$$Thither , immediately after midnight , Caesar , using as guides the same persons who had come to him as messengers from Iccius , sends some Numidian and Cretan archers , and some Balearian slingers as a relief to the towns-people , by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with the hope of defense , was infused into the Remi , and , for the same reason , the hope of gaining the town , abandoned the enemy .
<start> Itaque paulisper apud oppidum morati agrosque Remorum depopulati , omnibus vicis aedificiisque quo adire potuerant incensis , ad castra Caesaris omnibus copiis contenderunt et a milibus passuum minus duobus castra posuerunt ; quae castra , ut fumo atque ignibus significabatur , amplius milibus passuum VIII latitudinem patebant . <end>$$Therefore , after staying a short time before the town , and laying waste the country of the Remi , when all the villages and buildings which they could approach had been burned , they hastened with all their forces to the camp of Caesar , and encamped within less than two miles ; and their camp , as was indicated by the smoke and fires , extended more than eight miles in breadth .
<start> Caesar primo et propter multitudinem hostium et propter eximiam opinionem virtutis proelio supersedere statuit ; cotidie tamen equestribus proeliis quid hostis virtute posset et quid nostri auderent periclitabatur . <end>$$Caesar at first determined to decline a battle , as well on account of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished reputation for valor : daily , however , in cavalry actions , he strove to ascertain by frequent trials , what the enemy could effect by their prowess and what our men would dare .
<start> Ubi nostros non esse inferiores intellexit , loco pro castris ad aciem instruendam natura oportuno atque idoneo , quod is collis ubi castra posita erant paululum ex planitie editus tantum adversus in latitudinem patebat quantum loci acies instructa occupare poterat , atque ex utraque parte lateris deiectus habebat et in fronte leniter fastigatus paulatim ad planitiem redibat , ab utroque latere eius collis transversam fossam obduxit circiter passuum CCCC et ad extremas fossas castella constituit ibique tormenta conlocavit , ne , cum aciem instruxisset , hostes , quod tantum multitudine poterant , ab lateribus pugnantes suos circumvenire possent . <end>$$When he perceived that our men were not inferior , as the place before the camp was naturally convenient and suitable for marshaling an army ; on either side of that hill he drew a cross trench of about four hundred paces , and at the extremities of that trench built forts , and placed there his military engines , lest , after he had marshaled his army , the enemy , since they were so powerful in point of number , should be able to surround his men in the flank , while fighting .
<start> Hoc facto , duabus legionibus quas proxime conscripserat in castris relictis ut , si quo opus esset , subsidio duci possent , reliquas VI legiones pro castris in acie constituit . <end>$$After doing this , and leaving in the camp the two legions which he had last raised , that , if there should be any occasion , they might be brought as a reserve , he formed the other six legions in order of battle before the camp .
<start> Hostes item suas copias ex castris eductas instruxerunt . <end>$$The enemy , likewise , had drawn up their forces which they had brought out of the camp .
<start> Palus erat non magna inter nostrum atque hostium exercitum . <end>$$There was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that of the enemy .
<start> Hanc si nostri transirent hostes expectabant ; nostri autem , si ab illis initium transeundi fieret , ut impeditos adgrederentur parati in armis erant . <end>$$The latter were waiting to see if our men would pass this ; our men , also , were ready in arms to attack them while disordered , if the first attempt to pass should be made by them .
<start> Interim proelio equestri inter duas acies contendebatur . <end>$$In the mean time battle was commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action .
<start> Ubi neutri transeundi initium faciunt , secundiore equitum proelio nostris Caesar suos in castra reduxit . <end>$$When neither army began to pass the marsh , Caesar , upon the skirmishes of the horse favorable to our men , led back his forces into the camp .
<start> Hostes protinus ex eo loco ad flumen Axonam contenderunt , quod esse post nostra castra demonstratum est . <end>$$The enemy immediately hastened from that place to the river Aisne , which it has been stated , was behind our camp .
<start> Ibi vadis repertis partem suarum copiarum traducere conati sunt eo consilio ut , si possent , castellum , cui praeerat QuintusTiturius legatus , expugnarent pontemque interscinderent , si minus potuissent , agros Remorum popularentur , qui magno nobis usui ad bellum gerendum erant , commeatuque nostros prohiberent . <end>$$Finding a ford there , they endeavored to lead a part of their forces over it ; with the design , that , if they could , they might carry by storm the fort which Quintus Titurius , Caesar's legate , commanded , and might cut off the bridge ; but , if they could not do that , they should lay waste the lands of the Remi , which were of great use to us in carrying on the war , and might hinder our men from foraging .
<start> certior factus ab Titurio onlnem equitatum et levis armaturae Numidas , funditores sagittariosque pontem traducit atque ad eos contendit . <end>$$Caesar , being apprized of this by Titurius , leads all his cavalry and light-armed Numidians , slingers and archers , over the bridge , and hastens toward them .
<start> Acriter in eo loco pugnatum est . <end>$$There was a severe struggle in that place .
<start> Hostes impeditos nostri in flumine adgressi magnum eorum numerum occiderunt ; per eorum corpora reliquos audacissime transire conantes multitudine telorum reppulerunt primosque , qui transierant , equitatu circumventos interfecerunt . <end>$$Our men , attacking in the river the disordered enemy , slew a great part of them By the immense number of their missiles they drove back the rest , who , in a most courageous manner were attempting to pass over their bodies , and surrounded with their cavalry , and cut to pieces those who had first crossed the river .
<start> Hostes , ubi et de expugnando oppido et de flumine transeundo spem se fefellisse intellexerunt neque nostros in locum iniquiorum progredi pugnandi causa viderunt atque ipsos res frumentaria deficere coepit , concilio convocato constituerunt optimum esse domum suam quemque reverti , et quorum in fines primum Romani exercitum introduxissent , ad eos defendendos undique convenirent , ut potius in suis quam in alienis finibus decertarent et domesticis copiis rei frumentariae uterentur . <end>$$The enemy , when they perceived that their hopes had deceived them both with regard to their taking the town by storm and also their passing the river , and did not see our men advance to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting , and when provisions began to fail them , having called a council , determined that it was best for each to return to his country , and resolved to assemble from all quarters to defend those into whose territories the Romans should first march an army ; that they might contend in their own rather than in a foreign country , and might enjoy the stores of provision which they possessed at home .
<start> Ad eam sententiam cum reliquis causis haec quoque ratio eos deduxit , quod Diviciacum atque Haeduos finibus Bellovacorum adpropinquare cognoverant . <end>$$Together with other causes , this consideration also led them to that resolution , viz : that they had learned that Diviciacus and the Aedui were approaching the territories of the Bellovaci .
<start> His persuaderi ut diutius morarentur neque suis auxilium terrent non poterat . <end>$$And it was impossible to persuade the latter to stay any longer , or to deter them from conveying succor to their own people .
<start> Ea re constituta , secunda vigilia magno cum , strepitu ac tumultu castris egressi nullo certo ordine neque imperio , cum sibi quisque primum itineris locum peteret et domum pervenire properaret , fecerunt ut consimilis fugae profectio videretur . <end>$$That matter being determined on , marching out of their camp at the second watch , with great noise and confusion , in no fixed order , nor under any command , since each sought for himself the foremost place in the journey , and hastened to reach home , they made their departure appear very like a flight .
<start> Hac re statim Caesar per speculatores cognita insidias veritus , quod qua de causa discederent nondum perspexerat , exercitum equitatumque castris continuit . <end>$$Caesar , immediately learning this through his scouts , fearing an ambuscade , because he had not yet discovered for what reason they were departing , kept his army and cavalry within the camp .
<start> His QuintusPedium et LuciusAurunculeium Cottam legatos praefecit ; TitusLabienum legatum cum legionibus tribus subsequi iussit . <end>$$He ordered Titus Labienus , another of his legates , to follow them closely with three legions .
<start> Hi novissimos adorti et multa milia passuum prosecuti magnam multitudinem eorum fugientium conciderunt , cum ab extremo agmine , ad quos ventum erat , consisterent fortiterque impetum nostrorum militum sustinerent , priores , quod abesse a periculo viderentur neque ulla necessitate neque imperio continerentur , exaudito clamore perturbatis ordinibus omnes in fuga sibi praesidium ponerent . <end>$$These , attacking their rear , and pursuing them for many miles , slew a great number of them as they were fleeing ; while those in the rear with whom they had come up , halted , and bravely sustained the attack of our soldiers ; the van , because they appeared to be removed from danger , and were not restrained by any necessity or command , as soon as the noise was heard , broke their ranks , and , to a man , rested their safety in flight .
<start> Ita sine ullo periculo tantam eorum multitudinem nostri interfecerunt quantum fuit diei spatium ; sub occasum solis sequi destiterunt seque in castra , ut erat imperatum , receperunt . <end>$$Thus without any risk our men killed as great a number of them as the length of the day allowed ; and at sunset desisted from the pursuit , and betook themselves into the camp , as they had been commanded .
<start> Postridie eius diei Caesar , prius quam se hostes ex terrore ac fuga reciperent , in fines Suessionum , qui proximi Remis erant , exercitum duxit et magno itinere ad oppidum Noviodunum contendit . <end>$$On the day following , before the enemy could recover from their terror and flight , Caesar led his army into the territories of the Suessiones , which are next to the Remi , and having accomplished a long march , hastens to the town named Noviodunum .
<start> Id ex itinere oppugnare conatus , quod vacuum ab defensoribus esse audiebat , propter latitudinem fossae murique altitudinem paucis defendentihus expugnare non potuit . <end>$$Having attempted to take it by storm on his march , because he heard that it was destitute of defenders , he was not able to carry it by assault , on account of the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall , though few were defending it .
<start> Castris munitis vineas agere quaeque ad oppugnandum usui erant comparare coepit . <end>$$Therefore , having fortified the camp , he began to bring up the vineae , and to provide whatever things were necessary for the storm .
<start> Interim omnis ex fuga Suessionum multitudo in oppidum proxima nocte convenit . <end>$$In the mean time the whole body of the Suessiones , after their flight , came the next night into the town .
<start> Celeriter vineis ad oppidum actis , aggere iacto turribusque constitutis , magnitudine operum , quae neque viderant ante Galli neque audierant , et celeritate Romanorum permoti legatos ad Caesarem de deditione mittunt et petentibus Remis ut conservarentur impetrant . <end>$$The vineae having been quickly brought up against the town , a mound thrown up , and towers built , the Gauls , amazed by the greatness of the works , such as they had neither seen nor heard of before , and struck also by the dispatch of the Romans , send embassadors to Caesar respecting a surrender , and succeed in consequence of the Remi requesting that they might be spared .
<start> Caesar , obsidibus acceptis primis civitatis atque ipsius Galbae regis duobus filiis armisque omnibus ex oppido traditis , in deditionem Suessiones accipit exercitumque in Bellovacos ducit . <end>$$Caesar , having received as hostages the first men of the state , and even the two sons of king Galba himself ; and all the arms in the town having been delivered up , admitted the Suessiones to a surrender , and led his army against the Bellovaci .
<start> Qui cum se suaque omnia in oppidum Bratuspantium contulissent atque ab eo oppido Caesar cum exercitu circiter milia passuum V abesset , omnes maiores natu ex oppido egressi manus ad Caesarem tendere et voce significare coeperunt sese in eius fidem ac potestatem venire neque contra populum Romanum armis contendere . <end>$$Who , when they had conveyed themselves and all their possessions into the town called Bratuspantium , and Caesar with his army was about five miles distant from that town , all the old men , going out of the town , began to stretch out their hands to Caesar , and to intimate by their voice that they would throw themselves on his protection and power , nor would contend in arms against the Roman people .
<start> Item , cum ad oppidum accessisset castraque ibi poneret , pueri mulieresque ex muro passis mallibus suo more pacem ab Romanis petierunt . <end>$$In like manner , when he had come up to the town , and there pitched his camp , the boys and the women from the wall , with outstretched hands , after their custom , begged peace from the Romans .
<start> Petere non solum Bellovacos , sed etiam pro his Haeduos , ut sua clementia ac mansuetudine in eos utatur . <end>$$That they who had been the leaders of that plot , because they perceived how great a calamity they had brought upon the state , had fled into Britain .
<start> Quod si fecerit , Haeduorum auctoritatem apud omnes Belgas amplificaturum , quorum auxiliis atque opibus , si qua bella inciderint , sustentare consuerint . <end>$$That not only the Bellovaci , but also the Aedui , entreated him to use his clemency and lenity toward them : which if he did , he would increase the influence of the Aedui among all the Belgae , by whose succor and resources they had been accustomed to support themselves whenever any wars occurred .
<start> Caesar honoris Diviciaci atque Haeduorum causa sese eos in fidem recepturum et conservaturum dixit , et quod erat civitas magna inter Belgas auctoritate atque hominum multitudine praestabat , DC obsides poposcit . <end>$$Caesar said that on account of his respect for Diviciacus and the Aeduans , he would receive them into his protection , and would spare them ; but , because the state was of great influence among the Belgae , and pre-eminent in the number of its population , he demanded 600 hostages .
<start> His traditis omnibusque armis ex oppido conlatis , ab eo loco in fines Ambianorum pervenit ; qui se suaque omnia sine mora dediderunt . <end>$$When these were delivered , and all the arms in the town collected , he went from that place into the territories of the Ambiani , who , without delay , surrendered themselves and all their possessions .
<start> Eorum fines Nervii attingebant Quorum de natura moribusque Caesar cum quaereret , sic reperiebat : nullum esse aditum ad eos mercatoribus ; nihil pati vini reliquarumque rerum ad luxuriam pertinentium inferri , quod his rebus relanguescere animos eorum et remitti virtutem existimarent ; esse homines feros magnaeque virtutis ; increpitare atque incusare reliquos Belgas , qui se populo Romano dedidissent patriamque virtutem proiecissent ; confirmare sese neque legatos missuros neque ullam condicionem pacis accepturos . <end>$$Upon their territories bordered the Nervii , concerning whose character and customs when Caesar inquired he received the following information : —That there was no access for merchants to them ; that they suffered no wine and other things tending to luxury to be imported ; because , they thought that by their use the mind is enervated and the courage impaired : that they were a savage people and of great bravery : that they upbraided and condemned the rest of the Belgae who had surrendered themselves to the Roman people and thrown aside their national courage : that they openly declared they would neither send embassadors , nor accept any condition of peace .
<start> Cum per eorum fines triduum iter fecisset , inveniebat ex captivis Sabim flumen a castris suis non amplius milibus passuum X abesse ; trans id flumen omnes Nervios consedisse adventumque ibi Romanorum expectare una cum Atrebatibus et Viromanduis , finitimis suis (nam his utrisque persuaserant uti eandem belli fortunam experirentur) ; expectari etiam ab iis Atuatucorum copias atque esse in itinere ; mulieres quique per aetatem ad pugnam inutiles viderentur in eum locum coniecisse quo propter paludes exercitui aditus non esset . <end>$$After he had made three days march through their territories , he discovered from some prisoners , that the river Sambre was not more than ten miles from his camp ; that all the Nervii had stationed themselves on the other side of that river , and together with the Atrebates and the Viromandui , their neighbors , were there awaiting the arrival of the Romans ; for they had persuaded both these nations to try the same fortune of war : that the forces of the Aduatuci were also expected by them , and were on their march ; that they had put their women , and those who through age appeared useless for war , in a place to which there was no approach for an army , on account of the marshes .
<start> His rebus cognitis , exploratores centurionesque praemittit qui locum castris idoneum deligant . <end>$$Having learned these things , he sends forward scouts and centurions to choose a convenient place for the camp .
<start> Cum ex dediticiis Belgis reliquisque Gallis complures Caesarem secuti una iter facerent , quidam ex his , ut postea ex captivis cognitum est , eorum dierum consuetudine itineris nostri exercitus perspecta , nocte ad Nervios pervenerunt atque his demonstrarunt inter singulas legiones impedimentorum magnum numerum intercedere , neque esse quicquam negotii , cum prima legio in castra venisset reliquaeque legiones magnum spatium abessent , hanc sub sarcinis adoriri ; qua pulsa impedimentisque direptis , futurum ut reliquae contra consistere non auderent . <end>$$And as a great many of the surrounding Belgae and other Gauls , following Caesar , marched with him ; some of these , as was afterwards learned from the prisoners , having accurately observed , during those days , the army's method of marching , went by night to the Nervii , and informed them that a great number of baggage-trains passed between the several legions , and that there would be no difficulty , when the first legion had come into the camp , and the other legions were at a great distance , to attack that legion while under baggage , which being routed , and the baggage-train seized , it would come to pass that the other legions would not dare to stand their ground .
<start> Adiuvabat etiam eorum collsilium qui rem deferebant quod Nervii antiquitus , cum equitatu nihil possent (neque enim ad hoc tempus ei rei student , sed quicquid possunt , pedestribus valent copiis) , quo facilius finitimorum equitatum , si praedandi causa ad eos venissent , impedirent , teneris arboribus incisis atque inflexis crebrisque in latitudinem ramis enatis rubis sentibusque interiectis effecerant ut instar muri hae saepes munimentum praeberent , quo non modo non intrari sed ne perspici quidem posset . <end>$$It added weight also to the advice of those who reported that circumstance , that the Nervii , from early times , because they were weak in cavalry , , in order that they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their neighbors if they came upon them for the purpose of plundering , having cut young trees , and bent them , by means of their numerous branches on to the sides , and the quick-briars and thorns springing up between them , had made these hedges present a fortification like a wall , through which it was not only impossible to enter , but even to penetrate with the eye .
<start> His rebus cum iter agminis nostri impediretur , non omittendum sibi consilium Nervii existimaverunt . <end>$$Since the march of our army would be obstructed by these things , the Nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected by them .
<start> Loci natura erat haec , quem locum nostri castris delegerant Collis ab summo aequaliter declivis ad flumen Sabim , quod supra nominavimus , vergebat Ab eo flumine pari acclivitate collis nascebatur adversus huic et contrarius , passus circiter CC infimus apertus , ab superiore parte silvestris , ut non facile introrsus perspici posset . <end>$$The nature of the ground which our men had chosen for the camp was this : A hill , declining evenly from the top , extending to the river Sambre , which we have mentioned above : from this river there arose a hill of like ascent , on the other side and opposite to the former , and open for about 200 paces at the lower part ; but in the upper part , woody , that it was not easy to see through it into the interior .
<start> Intra eas silvas hostes in occulto sese continebant ; in aperto loco secundum flumen paucae stationes equitum videbantur . <end>$$Within these woods the enemy kept themselves in concealment ; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground , along the river .
<start> Fluminis erat altitudo pedum circiter trium . <end>$$The depth of the river was about three feet .
<start> Caesar equitatu praemisso subsequebatur omnibus copiis ; sed ratio ordoque agminis aliter se habebat ac Belgae ad Nervios detulerant . <end>$$Caesar , having sent his cavalry on before , followed close after them with all his forces ; but the plan and order of the march was different from that which the Belgae had reported to the Nervii .
<start> Caesari omnia uno tempore erant agenda : vexillum proponendum , quod erat insigne , cum ad arma concurri oporteret ; signum tuba dandum ; ab opere revocandi milites ; qui paulo longius aggeris petendi causa processerant arcessendi ; acies instruenda ; milites cohortandi ; signum dandum . <end>$$Caesar had every thing to do at one time : the standard to be displayed , which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms ; the signal to be given by the trumpet ; the soldiers to be called off from the works ; those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of seeking materials for the rampart , to be summoned ; the order of battle to be formed ; the soldiers to be encouraged ; the watchword to be given .
<start> Quarum rerum magnam partem temporis brevitas et incursus hostium impediebat . <end>$$A great part of these arrangements was prevented by the shortness of time and the sudden approach and charge of the enemy .
<start> His difficultatibus duae res erant subsidio , scientia atque usus militum , quod superioribus proeliis exercitati quid fieri oporteret non minus commode ipsi sibi praescribere quam ab aliis doceri poterant , et quod ab opere singulisque legionibus singulos legatos Caesar discedere nisi munitis castris vetuerat . <end>$$Under these difficulties two things proved of advantage ; the skill and experience of the soldiers , because , having been trained by former engagements , they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done , as conveniently as receive information from others ; and that Caesar had forbidden his several legates to depart from the works and their respective legions , before the camp was fortified .
<start> Hi propter propinquitatem et celeritatem hostium nihil iam Caesaris imperium expectabant , sed per se quae videbantur administrabant . <end>$$These , on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy , did not then wait for any command from Caesar , but of themselves executed whatever appeared proper .
<start> Caesar , necessariis rebus imperatis , ad cohortandos milites , quam partem fors obtulit , decucurrit et ad legionem decimam devenit . <end>$$Caesar , having given the necessary orders , hastened to and fro into whatever quarter fortune carried him , to animate the troops , and came to the tenth legion .
<start> Milites non longiore oratione cohortatus quam uti suae pristinae virtutis memoriam retinerent neu perturbarentur animo hostiumque impetum fortiter sustinerent , quod non longius hostes aberant quam quo telum adigi posset , proelii committendi signum dedit . <end>$$Having encouraged the soldiers with no further speech than that they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted valor , and not be confused in mind , but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy ; as the latter were not further from them than the distance to which a dart could be cast , he gave the signal for commencing battle .
<start> Atque in alteram item cohortandi causa profectus pugnantibus occurrit . <end>$$And having gone to another quarter for the purpose of encouraging , he finds them fighting .
<start> Temporis tanta fuit exiguitas hostiumque tam paratus ad dimicandum animus ut non modo ad insignia accommodanda sed etiam ad galeas induendas scutisque tegimenta detrahenda tempus defuerit . <end>$$Such was the shortness of the time , and so determined was the mind of the enemy on fighting , that time was wanting not only for affixing the military insignia , but even for putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers from the shields .
<start> Quam quisque ab opere in partem casu devenit quaeque prima signa conspexit , ad haec constitit , ne in quaerendis suis pugnandi tempus dimitteret . <end>$$To whatever part any one by chance came from the works , and whatever standards he saw first , at these he stood , lest in seeking his own company he should lose the time for fighting .
<start> Instructo exercitu magis ut loci natura et necessitas temporis quam ut rei militaris ratio atque ordo postulabat , cum diversae legiones aliae alia in parte hostibus resisterent saepibusque densissimis , ut ante demonstravimus , interiectis prospectus impediretur , neque certa subsidia conlocari neque quid in quaque parte opus esset provideri neque ab uno omnia imperia administrari poterant . <end>$$The army having been marshaled , rather as the nature of the ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time , than as the method and order of military matters required ; while the legions in the different places were withstanding the enemy , some in one quarter , some in another , and the view was obstructed by the very thick hedges intervening , as we have before remarked , neither could proper reserves be posted , nor could the necessary measures be taken in each part , nor could all the commands be issued by one person .
<start> Itaque in tanta rerum iniquitate fortunae quoque eventus varii sequebantur . <end>$$Therefore , in such an unfavorable state of affairs , various events of fortune followed .
<start> Legionis VIIII et X milites , ut in sinistra parte aciei constiterant , pilis emissis cursu ac lassitudine exanimatos vulneribusque confectos Atrebates celeriter ex loco superiore in flumen compulerunt et transire conantes insecuti gladiis magnam partem eorum impeditam interfecerunt . <end>$$The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions , as they had been stationed on the left part of the army , casting their weapons , speedily drove the Atrebates who were breathless with running and fatigue , and worn out with wounds , from the higher ground into the river ; and following them as they were endeavoring to pass it , slew with their swords a great part of them while impeded  .
<start> Ipsi transire flumen non dubitaverunt et in locum iniquum progressi rursus resistentes hostes redintegrato proelio in fugam coniecerunt . <end>$$They themselves did not hesitate to pass the river ; and having advanced to a disadvantageous place , when the battle was renewed , they again put to flight the enemy , who had returned and were opposing them .
<start> Item alia in parte diversae duae legiones , XI et VIII , profligatis Viromanduis , quibuscum erant congressae , ex loco superiore in ipsis fluminis ripis proeliabantur . <end>$$In like manner , in another quarter two different legions , the eleventh and the eighth , having routed the Viromandui , with whom they had engaged , were fighting from the higher ground upon the very banks of the river .
<start> At totis fere castris a fronte et a sinistra parte nudatis , cum in dextro cornu legio XII et non magno ab ea intervallo VII constitisset , omnes Nervii confertissimo agmine duce Boduognato , qui summam imperii tenebat , ad eum locum contenderunt ; quorum pars ab aperto latere legiones circumvenire , pars summum castrorum locum petere coepit . <end>$$But , almost the whole camp on the front and on the left side being then exposed , since the twelfth legion was posted in the right wing , and the seventh at no great distance from it , all the Nervii , in a very close body , with Boduognatus , who held the chief command , as their leader , hastened toward that place ; and part of them began to surround the legions on their unprotected flank , part to make for the highest point of the encampment .
<start> Eodem tempore equites nostri levisque armaturae pedites , qui cum iis una fuerant , quos primo hostium impetu pulsos dixeram , cum se in castra reciperent , adversis hostibus occurrebant ac rursus aliam in partem fugam petebant ; et calones , qui ab decumana porta ac summo iugo collis nostros victores flumen transire conspexerant , praedandi causa egressi , cum respexissent et hostes in nostris castris versari vidissent , praecipites fugae sese mandabant . <end>$$At the same time our horsemen , and light-armed infantry , who had been with those , who , as I have related , were routed by the first assault of the enemy , as they were betaking themselves into the camp , met the enemy face to face , and again sought flight into another quarter ; and the camp-followers who from the Decuman Gate , and from the highest ridge of the hill had seen our men pass the river as victors , when , after going out for the purposes of plundering , they looked back and saw the enemy parading in our camp , committed themselves precipitately to flight ; at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came with the baggage-train : and they , were carried some one way , some another .
<start> Simul eorum qui cum impedimentis veniebant clamor fremitusque oriebatur , aliique aliam in partem perterriti ferebantur Quibus omnibus rebus permoti equites Treveri , quorum inter Gallos virtutis opinio est singularis , qui auxilii causa a civitate missi ad Caesarem venerant , cum multitudine hostium castra compleri , legiones premi et paene circumventas teneri , calones , equites , tunditores , Numidas diversos dissipatosque in omnes partes fugere vidissent , desperatis nostris rebus domum contenderunt : Romanos pulsos superatosque , castris impedimentisque eorum hostes potitos civitati renuntiaverunt . <end>$$By all these circumstances the cavalry of the Treviri were much alarmed , , and , when they saw our camp filled with a large number of the enemy , the legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded , the camp-retainers , horsemen , slingers , and Numidians fleeing on all sides divided and scattered , they , despairing of our affairs , hastened home , and related to their state that the Romans were routed and conquered , that the enemy were in possession of their camp and baggage-train .
<start> Caesar ab X legionis cohortatione ad dextrum cornu prolectus , ubi suos urgeri signisque in unum locum conlatis XII legionis confertos milites sibi ipsos ad pugnam esse impedimento vidit , quartae cohortis omnibus centurionibus occisis signiferoque interfecto , signo amisso , reliquarum cohortium omnibus fere centurionibus aut vulneratis aut occisis , in his primipilo Publius Sextio Baculo , fortissimo viro , multis gravibusque vulneribus confecto , ut iam se sustinere non posset , reliquos esse tardiores et non nullos ab novissimis deserto loco proelio excedere ac tela vitare , hostes neque a fronte ex inferiore loco subeuntes intermittere et ab utroque latere instare et rem esse in angusto vidit , neque ullum esse subsidium quod submitti posset , scuto ab novissimis militi detracto , quod ipse eo sine scuto venerat , in primam aciem processit centurionibusque nominatim appellatis reliquos cohortatus milites signa inferre et manipulos laxare iussit , quo facilius gladiis uti possent . <end>$$Caesar proceeded , after encouraging the tenth legion , to the right wing ; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed , and that in consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected together in one place , the crowded soldiers were a hinderance to themselves in the fight ; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain , and the standard-bearer killed , the standard itself lost , almost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain , and among them the chief centurion of the legion Publius Sextius Baculus , a very valiant man , who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds , that he was already unable to support himself ; he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts , and that some , deserted by those in the rear , were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons ; that the enemy though advancing from the lower ground , were not relaxing in front , and were pressing hard on both flanks ; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis , and that there was not any reserve which could be brought up , having therefore snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear , he advanced to the front of the line , and addressing the centurions by name , and encouraging the rest of the soldiers , he ordered them to carry forward the standards , and extend the companies , that they might the more easily use their swords .
<start> Cuius adventu spe inlata militibus ac redintegrato animo , cum pro se quisque in conspectu imperatoris etiam in extremis suis rebus operam navare cuperet , paulum hostium impetus tardatus est . <end>$$On his arrival , as hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored , while every one for his own part , in the sight of his general , desired to exert his utmost energy , the impetuosity of the enemy was a little checked .
<start> Caesar , cum VII legionem , quae iuxta constiterat , item urgeri ab hoste vidisset , tribunos militum monuit ut paulatim sese legiones coniungerent et conversa signa in hostes inferrent Quo facto cum aliis alii subsidium ferrent neque timerent ne aversi ab hoste circumvenirentur , audacius resistere ac fortius pugnare coeperunt . <end>$$Caesar , when he perceived that the seventh legion , which stood close by him , was also hard pressed by the enemy , directed the tribunes of the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually , and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front ; which having been done , since they brought assistance the one to the other , nor feared lest their rear should be surrounded by the enemy , they began to stand their ground more boldly , and to fight more courageously .
<start> Interim milites legionum duarum quae in novissimo agmine praesidio impedimentis fuerant , proelio nuntiato , cursu incitato in summo colle ab hostibus conspiciebantur , et TitusLabienus castris hostium potitus et ex loco superiore quae res in nostris castris gererentur conspicatus Xlegionem subsidio nostris misit Qui cum ex equitum et calonum fuga quo in loco res esset quantoque in periculo et castra et legiones et imperator versaretur cognovissent , nihil ad celeritatem sibi reliqui fecerunt . <end>$$In the mean time , the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army , as a guard for the baggage-train , upon the battle being reported to them , quickened their pace , and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill ; and Titus Labienus , having gained possession of the camp of the enemy , and observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp , sent the tenth legion as a relief to our men , who , when they had learned from the flight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was , and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were involved , left undone nothing to dispatch .
<start> Horum adventu tanta rerum commutatio est facta ut nostri , etiam qui vulneribus confecti procubuissent , scutis innixi proelium redintegrarent , calones perterritos hostes conspicati etiam inermes armatis occurrerent , equites vero , ut turpitudinem fugae virtute delerent , omnibus in locis pugnae se legionariis militibus praeferrent . <end>$$By their arrival , so great a change of matters was made , that our men , even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds , leaned on their shields , and renewed the fight : then the camp-retainers , though unarmed , seeing the enemy completely dismayed , attacked armed ; the horsemen too , that they might by their valor blot the disgrace of their flight , thrust themselves before the legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle .
<start> At hostes , etiam in extrema spe salutis , tantam virtutem praestiterunt ut , cum primi eorum cecidissent , proximi iacentibus insisterent atque ex eorum corporibus pugnarent , his deiectis et coacervatis cadaveribus qui superessent ut ex tumulo tela in nostros coicerent et pila intercepta remitterent : ut non nequiquam tantae virtutis homines iudicari deberet ausos esse transire latissimum flumen , ascendere altissimas ripas , subire iniquissimum locum ; quae facilia ex difficillimis animi magnitudo redegerat . <end>$$But the enemy , even in the last hope of safety , displayed such great courage , that when the foremost of them had fallen , the next stood upon them prostrate , and fought from their bodies ; when these were overthrown , and their corpses heaped up together , those who survived cast their weapons against our men , as from a mound , and returned our darts which had fallen short between ; so that it ought not to be concluded , that men of such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very broad river , ascend very high banks , and come up to a very disadvantageous place ; since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy , although in themselves very difficult .
<start> Atuatuci , de quibus supra diximus , cum omnibus copiis auxilio Nerviis venirent , hac pugna nuntiata ex itinere domum reverterunt ; cunctis oppidis castellisque desertis sua omnia in unum oppidum egregie natura munitum contulerunt . <end>$$When the Aduatuci , of whom we have written above , were coming up with all their forces to the assistance of the Nervii , upon this battle being reported to them , they returned home after they were on the march ; deserting all their towns and forts , they conveyed together all their possessions into one town , eminently fortified by nature .
<start> Quod cum ex omnibus in circuitu partibus altissimas rupes deiectusque haberet , una ex parte leniter acclivis aditus in latitudinem non amplius pedum CC relinquebatur ; quem locum duplici altissimo muro munierant ; tum magni ponderis saxa et praeacutas trabes in muro conlocabant . <end>$$While this town had on all sides around it very high rocks and precipices , there was left on one side a gently ascending approach , of not more than 200 feet in width ; which place they had fortified with a very lofty double wall : besides , they had placed stones of great weight and sharpened stakes upon the walls .
<start> Ipsi erant ex Cimbris Teutonisque prognati , qui , cum iter in provinciam nostram atque Italiam ; facerent , iis impedimentis quae secum agere ac portare non poterant citra flumen Rhenum depositis custodiae ac praesidio VI milia hominum una reliquerant . <end>$$They were descended from the Cimbri and Teutones , who , when they were marching into our province and Italy , having deposited on this side the river Rhine such of their baggage-trains as they could not drive or convey with them , left 6 , 000 of their men as a guard and defense for them .
<start> Hi post eorum obitum multos annos a finitimis exagitati , cum alias bellum inferrent , alias inlatum defenderent , consensu eorum omnium pace facta hunc sibi domicilio locum delegerant . <end>$$These having , after the destruction of their countrymen , been harassed for many years by their neighbors , while one time they waged war offensively , and at another resisted it when waged against them , concluded a peace with the consent of all , and chose this place as their settlement .
<start> Ac primo adventu exercitus nostri crebras ex oppido excursiones faciebant parvulisque proeliis cum nostris contendebant ; postea vallo pedum XII in circuitu milium crebrisque castellis circummuniti oppido sese continebant . <end>$$And on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies from the town , and contended with our men in trifling skirmishes ; afterward , when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet , and fifteen miles in circuit , they kept themselves within the town .
<start> Ubi vero moveri et adpropinquare muris viderunt , nova atque inusitata specie commoti legatos ad Caesarem de pace miserunt , qui ad hunc modum locuti , non se existimare Romanos sine ope divina bellum gerere , qui tantae altitudinis machinationes tanta celeritate promovere possent , se suaque omnia eorum potestati permittere dixerunt . <end>$$But when they saw that it was being moved , and was approaching their walls , startled by the new and unaccustomed sight , they sent embassadors to Caesar about peace ; who spoke in the following manner : That they did not believe the Romans waged war without divine aid , since they were able to move forward machines of such a height with so great speed , and thus fight from close quarters ; that they resigned themselves and all their possessions to disposal : that they begged and earnestly entreated one thing , viz .
<start> Ad haec Caesar respondit : se magis consuetudine sua quam merito eorum civitatem conservaturum , si prius quam murum aries attigisset se dedidissent ; sed deditionis nullam esse condicionem nisi armis traditis Se id quod in Nerviis fecisset facturum finitimisque imperaturum ne quam dediticiis populi Romani iniuriam inferrent . <end>$$To these things Caesar replied , That he , in accordance with his custom , rather than owing to their desert , should spare the state , if they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch the wall ; but that there was no condition of surrender , except upon their arms being delivered up ; that he should do to them that which he had done in the case of the Nervii , and would command their neighbors not to offer any injury to those who had surrendered to the Roman people .
<start> Re renuntiata ad suos illi se quae imperarentur facere dixerunt . <end>$$The matter being reported to their countrymen , they said that they would execute his commands .
<start> Armorum magna multitudine de muro in fossam , quae erat ante oppidum , iacta , sic ut prope summam muri aggerisque altitudinem acervi armorum adaequarent , et tamen circiter parte tertia , ut postea perspectum est , celata atque in oppido retenta , portis patefactis eo die pace sunt usi . <end>$$Having cast a very large quantity of their arms from the wall into the trench that was before the town , so that the heaps of arms almost equalled the top of the wall and the rampart , and nevertheless having retained and concealed , as we afterward discovered , about a third part in the town , the gates were opened , and they enjoyed peace for that day .
<start> Sub vesperum Caesar portas claudi militesque ex oppido exire iussit , ne quam noctu oppidani a militibus iniuriam acciperent . <end>$$Toward evening Caesar ordered the gates to be shut , and the soldiers to go out of the town , lest the towns-people should receive any injury from them by night .
<start> Illi ante inito , ut intellectum est , consilio , quod deditione facta nostros praesidia deducturos aut denique indiligentius servaturos crediderant , partim cum iis quae retinuerant et celaverant armis , partim scutis ex cortice factis aut viminibus intextis , quae subito , ut temporis exiguitas postulabat , pellibus induxerant , tertia vigilia , qua minime arduus ad nostras munitiones accensus videbatur , omnibus copiis repente ex oppido eruptionem fecerunt . <end>$$They , by a design before entered into , as we afterwards understood , because they believed that , as a surrender had been made , our men would dismiss their guards , or at least would keep watch less carefully , partly with those arms which they had retained and concealed , partly with shields made of bark or interwoven wickers , which they had hastily covered over with skins , in the third watch , suddenly made a sally from the town with all their forces in which the ascent to our fortifications seemed the least difficult .
<start> Celeriter , ut ante Caesar imperaverat , ignibus significatione facta , ex proximis castellis eo concursum est , pugnatumque ab hostibus ita acriter est ut a viris fortibus in extrema spe salutis iniquo loco contra eos qui ex vallo turribusque tela iacerent pugnari debuit , cum in una virtute omnis spes consisteret . <end>$$The signal having been immediately given by fires , as Caesar had previously commended , a rush was made thither from the nearest fort ; and the battle was fought by the enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fought by brave men , in the last hope of safety , in a disadvantageous place , and against those who were throwing their weapons from a rampart and from towers ; since all hope of safety depended on their courage alone .
<start> Occisis ad hominum milibus IIII reliqui in oppidum reiecti sunt . <end>$$About 4 , 000 of the men having been slain , the rest were forced back into the town .
<start> Postridie eius diei refractis portis , cum iam defenderet nemo , atque intromissis militibus nostris , sectionem eius oppidi universa Caesar vendidit . <end>$$The day after , Caesar , after breaking open the gates , which there was no one then to defend , and sending in our soldiers , sold the whole spoil of that town .
<start> Ab iis qui emerant capitum numerus ad eum relatus est milium LIII . <end>$$The number of 53 , 000 persons was reported to him by those who had bought them .
<start> Eodem tempore a Publius Crasso , quem cum legione una miserat ad Venetos , Venellos , Osismos , Coriosolitas , Esuvios , Aulercos , Redones , quae sunt maritimae civitates Oceanumque attingunt , certior factus est omnes eas civitates in dicionem potestatemque populi Romani esse redactas . <end>$$At the same time he was informed by Publius Crassus , whom he had sent with one legion against the Veneti , the Venelli , the Osismi , the Coriosolitae , the Esuvii , the Aulerci , and the Redones , which are maritime states , and touch upon the ocean , that all these nations were brought under the dominion and power of the Roman people .
<start> His rebus gestis omni Gallia pacata , tanta huius belli ad barbaros opinio perlata est uti ab iis nationibus quae trans Rhenum incolerent legationes ad Caesarem mitterentur , quae se obsides daturas , imperata facturas pollicerentur . <end>$$These things being achieved , all Gaul being subdued , so high an opinion of this war was spread among the barbarians , that embassadors were sent to Caesar by those nations who dwelt beyond the Rhine , to promise that they would give hostages and execute his commands .
<start> Quas legationes Caesar , quod in Italiam Illyricumque properabat , inita proxima aestate ad se reverti iussit . <end>$$Which embassies Caesar , because he was hastening into Italy and Illyricum , ordered to return to him at the beginning of the following summer .
<start> Ipse in Carnutes , Andes , Turonos quaeque civitates propinquae iis locis erant ubi bellum gesserat , legionibus in hiberna deductis , in Italiam profectus est Ob easque res ex litteris Caesaris dierum XV supplicatio decreta est , quod ante id tempus accidit nulli . <end>$$He himself , having led his legions into winter quarters among the Carnutes , the Andes , and the Turones , which states were close to those regions in which he had waged war , set out for Italy ; and a thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed for those achievements , upon receiving Caesar's letter ; which before that time had been conferred on none .
<start> Cum in Italiam proficisceretur Caesar , Ser Galbam cum legione XII et parte equitatus in Nantuates , Veragros Sedunosque misit , qui a finibus Allobrogum et lacu Lemanno et flumine Rhodano ad summas Alpes pertinent . <end>$$When Caesar was setting out for Italy , he sent Servius Galba with the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry , against the Nantuates , the Veragri , and Seduni , who extend from the territories of the Allobroges , and the lake of Geneva , and the River Rhône to the top of the Alps .
<start> Causa mittendi fuit quod iter per Alpes , quo magno cum periculo magnisque cum portoriis mercatores ire consuerant , patefieri volebat . <end>$$The reason for sending him was , that he desired that the pass along the Alps , through which merchants had been accustomed to travel with great danger , and under great imposts , should be opened .
<start> Huic permisit , si opus esse arbitraretur , uti in his locis legionem hiemandi causa conlocaret . <end>$$He permitted him , if he thought it necessary , to station the legion in these places , for the purpose of wintering .
<start> Galba secundis aliquot proeliis factis castellisque compluribus eorum expugnatis , missis ad eum undique legatis obsidibusque datis et pace facta , constituit cohortes duas in Nantuatibus conlocare et ipse cum reliquis eius legionis cohortibus in vico Veragrorum , qui appellatur Octodurus hiemare ; qui vicus positus in valle non magna adiecta planitie altissimis montibus undique continetur . <end>$$Galba having fought some successful battles and stormed several of their forts , upon embassadors being sent to him from all parts and hostages given and a peace concluded , determined to station two cohorts among the Nantuates , and to winter in person with the other cohorts of that legion in a village of the Veragri , which is called Octodurus ; and this village being situated in a valley , with a small plain annexed to it , is bounded on all sides by very high mountains .
<start> Cum hic in duas partes flumine divideretur , alteram partem eius vici Gallis concessit , alteram vacuam ab his relictam cohortibus attribuit . <end>$$As this village was divided into two parts by a river , he granted one part of it to the Gauls , and assigned the other , which had been left by them unoccupied , to the cohorts to winter in .
<start> Eum locum vallo fossaque munivit . <end>$$He fortified this part with a rampart and a ditch .
<start> Cum dies hibernorum complures transissent frumentumque eo comportari iussisset , subito per exploratores certior factus est ex ea parte vici , quam Gallis concesserat , omnes noctu discessisse montesque qui impenderent a maxima multitudine Sedunorum et Veragrorum teneri . <end>$$When several days had elapsed in winter quarters , and he had ordered corn to be brought in he was suddenly informed by his scouts that all the people had gone off in the night from that part of the town which he had given up to the Gauls , and that the mountains which hung over it were occupied by a very large force of the Seduni and Veragri .
<start> Id aliquot de causis acciderat , ut subito Galli belli renovandi legionisque opprimendae consilium caperent : primum , quod legionem neque eam plenissimam detractis cohortibus duabus et compluribus singillatim , qui commeatus petendi causa missi erant , absentibus propter paucitatem despiciebant ; tum etiam , quod propter iniquitatem loci , cum ipsi ex montibus in vallem decurrerent et tela coicerent , ne primum quidem impetum suum posse sustineri existimabant . <end>$$It had happened for several reasons that the Gauls suddenly formed the design of renewing the war and cutting off that legion First , because they despised a single legion , on account of its small number , and that not quite full ; then , likewise , because they thought that on account of the disadvantageous character of the situation , even their first attack could not be sustained when they would rush from the mountains into the valley , and discharge their weapons upon us .
<start> Accedebat quod suos ab se liberos abstraetos obsidum nomine dolebant , et Romanos non solum itinerum causa sed etiam perpetuae possessionis culmina Alpium oceupare conari et ea loca finitimae provinciae adiungere sibi persuasum habebant . <end>$$To this was added , that they were indignant that their children were torn from them under the title of hostages , and they were persuaded that the Romans designed to seize upon the summits of the Alps , and unite those parts to the neighboring province , not only to secure the passes , but also a constant possession .
<start> His nuntiis acceptis Galba , cum neque opus hibernorum munitionesque plene essent perfectae neque de frumento reliquoque commeatu satis esset provisum quod deditione facta obsidibusque acceptis nihil de bello timendum existimaverat , consilio celeriter convocato sententias exquirere coepit . <end>$$Having received these tidings , Galba , since the works of the winter-quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed , nor was sufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other provisions , speedily summoning a council , began to anxiously inquire their opinions .
<start> Quo in consilio , cum tantum repentini periculi praeter opinionem accidisset ac iam omnia fere superiora loca multitudine armatorum completa conspicerentur neque subsidio veniri neque commeatus supportari interclusis itineribus possent , prope iam desperata salute non nullae eius modi sententiae dicebantur , ut impedimentis relictis eruptione facta isdem itineribus quibus eo pervenissent ad salutem contenderent . <end>$$In which council , since so much sudden danger had happened contrary to the general expectation , and almost all the higher places were seen already covered with a multitude of armed men , nor could troops come to their relief , or provisions be brought in , as the passes were blocked up ; safety being now nearly despaired of , some opinions of this sort were delivered : that , leaving their baggage , and making a sally , they should hasten away for safety by the same routes by which they had come thither .
<start> Maiori tamen parti placuit , hoc reservato ad extremum casum consilio interim rei eventum experiri et castra defendere . <end>$$To the greater part , however , it seemed best , reserving that measure to the last , to await the issue of the matter , and to defend the camp .
<start> Brevi spatio interiecto , vix ut iis rebus quas constituissent conlocandis atque administrandis tempus daretur , hostes ex omnibus partibus signo dato decurrere , lapides gaesaque in vallum coicere . <end>$$A short time only having elapsed , so that time was scarcely given for arranging and executing those things which they had determined on , the enemy , upon the signal being given , rushed down from all parts , and discharged stones and darts , upon our rampart .
<start> Cum iam amplius horis sex continenter pugnaretur , ac non solum vires sed etiam tela nostros deficerent , atque hostes acrius instarent languidioribusque nostris vallum scindere et fossas complere coepissent , resque esset iam ad extremum perducta casum , Publius Sextius Baculus , primi pili centurio , quem Nervico proelio compluribus confectum vulneribus diximus , et item Gaius Volusenus , tribunus militum , vir et consilii magni et virtutis , ad Galbam accurrunt atque unam esse spem salutis docent , si eruptione facta extremum auxilium experirentur . <end>$$When they had now been fighting for more than six hours , without cessation , and not only strength , but even weapons were failing our men , and the enemy were pressing on more rigorously , and had begun to demolish the rampart and to fill up the trench , while our men were becoming exhausted , and the matter was now brought to the last extremity , Publius Sextius Baculus , a centurion of the first rank , whom we have related to have been disabled by severe wounds in the engagement with the Nervii , and also Gaius Volusenus , a tribune of the soldiers , a man of great skill and valor , hasten to Galba , and assure him that the only hope of safety lay in making a sally , and trying the last resource .
<start> Itaque convocatis centurionibus celeriter milites certiores facit , paulisper intermitterent proelium ac tantum modo tela missa exciperent seque ex labore reficerent , post dato signo ex castris erumperent , atque omnem spem salutis in virtute ponerent . <end>$$Whereupon assembling the centurions , he quickly gives orders to the soldiers to discontinue the fight a short time , and only collect the weapons flung , and recruit themselves after their fatigue , and afterward , upon the signal being given , sally forth from the camp , and place in their valor all their hope of safety .
<start> Quod iussi sunt faciunt , ac subito omnibus portis eruptione facta neque cognoscendi quid fieret neque sui colligendi hostibus facultatem relinquunt . <end>$$They do what they were ordered ; and , making a sudden sally from all the gates , leave the enemy the means neither of knowing what was taking place , nor of collecting themselves .
<start> Ita commutata fortuna eos qui in spem potiundorum castrorum venerant undique circumventos intercipiunt , et ex hominum milibus amplius XXX , quem numerum barbarorum ad castra venisse constabat , plus tertia parte interfecta reliquos perterritos in fugam coiciunt ac ne in locis quidem superioribus consistere patiuntur . <end>$$Fortune thus taking a turn , surround on every side , and slay those who had entertained the hope of gaining the camp and having killed more than the third part of an army of more than 30 , 000 men , put to flight the rest when panic-stricken , and do not suffer them to halt even upon the higher grounds .
<start> Sic omnibus hostium copiis fusis armisque exutis se intra munitiones suas recipiunt . <end>$$All the forces of the enemy being thus routed , and stripped of their arms , betake themselves to their camp and fortifications .
<start> Quo proelio facto , quod saepius fortunam temptare Galba nolebat atque alio se in hiberna consilio venisse meminerat , aliis occurrisse rebus videbat , maxime frumenti inopia permotus postero die omnibus eius vici aedificiis incensis in provinciam reverti contendit , ac nullo hoste prohibente aut iter demorante incolumem legionem in Nantuates , inde in Allobroges perduxit ibique hiemavit . <end>$$Which battle being finished , inasmuch as Galba was unwilling to tempt fortune again , and remembered that he had come into winter quarters with one design , and saw that he had met with a different state of affairs ; chiefly however urged by the want of corn and provision , having the next day burned all the buildings of that village , he hastens to return into the province ; and as no enemy opposed or hindered his march , he brought the legion safe into the Nantuates , thence into the Allobroges , and there wintered .
<start> His rebus gestis cum omnibus de causis Caesar pacatam Galliam existimaret , atque ita inita hieme in Illyricum profectus esset , quod eas quoque nationes adire et regiones cognoseere volebat , subitum bellum in Gallia eoortum est . <end>$$These things being achieved , while Caesar had every reason to suppose that Gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity , the Belgae being overcome , the Germans expelled , the Seduni among the Alps defeated , and when he had , therefore , in the beginning of winter , set out for Illyricum , as he wished to visit those nations , and acquire a knowledge of their countries , a sudden war sprang up in Gaul .
<start> Eius belli haec fuit causa Publius Crassus adulescens eum legione VII proximus mare Oeeanum in Andibus hiemabat . <end>$$The occasion of that war was this : Publius Crassus , a young man , had taken up his winter quarters with the seventh legion among the Andes , who border upon the ocean .
<start> Is , quod in his loeis inopia frumenti erat , praefectos tribunosque militum eomplures in finitimas civitates frumenti causa dimisit ; quo in numero est Titus Terrasidius missus in Esuvios , Marcus Trebius Gallus in Coriosolites , Quintus Velanius eum Titus Silio in Venetos . <end>$$He , as there was a scarcity of corn in those parts , sent out some officers of cavalry , and several military tribunes among the neighbouring states , for the purpose of procuring corn and provision ; in which number Titus Terrasidius was sent among the Esubii ; Marcus Trebius Gallus among the Coriosolitae ; Quintus Velanius , Titus Silius , amongst the Veneti .
<start> Huius est civitatis longe amplissima auctoritas omnis orae maritimae regionum earum , quod et naves habent Veneti plurimas , quibus in Britanniam navigare consuerunt , et scientia atque usu rerum nauticarum ceteros antecedunt et in magno impetu maris atque aperto paucis portibus interiectis , quos tenent ipsi , omnes fere qui eo mari uti consuerunt habent vectigales . <end>$$The influence of this state is by far the most considerable of any of the countries on the whole sea coast , because the Veneti both have a very great number of ships , with which they have been accustomed to sail to Britain , and excel the rest in their knowledge and experience of nautical affairs ; and as only a few ports lie scattered along that stormy and open sea , of which they are in possession , they hold as tributaries almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in that sea .
<start> Ab his fit initium retinendi Silii atque Velanii , quod per eos suos se obsides , quos Crasso dedissent , recuperaturos existimabant . <end>$$With them arose the beginning by their detaining Silius and Velanius ; for they thought that they should recover by their means the hostages which they had given to Crassus .
<start> Horum auctoritate finitimi adducti , ut sunt Gallorum subita et repentina consilia , eadem de causa Trebium Terrasidiumque retinent et celeriter missis legatis per suos principes inter se coniurant nihil nisi communi consilio acturos eundemque omnes fortunae exitum esse laturos , reliquasque civitates sollicitant , ut in ea libertate quam a maioribus acceperint permanere quam Romanorum servitutem perferre malint . <end>$$The neighboring people led on by their influence , detain Trebius and Terrasidius for the same motive ; and quickly sending embassadors , by means of their leading men , they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except by general consent , and abide the same issue of fortune ; and they solicit the other states to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they had received from their ancestors , than endure slavery under the Romans .
<start> Omni ora maritima celeriter ad suam sententiam perducta communem legationem ad Publius Crassum mittunt , si velit suos recuperare , obsides sibi remittat . <end>$$All the sea coast being quickly brought over to their sentiments , they send a common embassy to Publius Crassus , If he wished to receive back his officers , let him send back to them their hostages .
<start> Quibus de rebus Caesar a Crasso certior factus , quod ipse aberat longius , naves interim longas aedificari in flumine Ligeri , quod influit in Oceanum , remiges ex provincia institui , nautas gubernatoresque comparari iubet . <end>$$Caesar , being informed of these things by Crassus , since he was so far distant himself , orders ships of war to be built in the mean time on the river Loire , which flows into the ocean ; rowers to be raised from the province ; sailors and pilots to be provided .
<start> Veneti reliquaeque item civitates cognito Caesaris adventu , simul quod quantum in se facinus admisissent intellegebant , pro magnitudine periculi bellum parare et maxime ea quae ad usum navium pertinent providere instituunt , hoc maiore spe quod multum natura loci confidebant . <end>$$They knew that the passes by land were cut off by estuaries , that the approach by sea was most difficult , by reason of our ignorance of the localities , the small number of the harbors , and they trusted that our army would not be able to stay very long among them , on account of the insufficiency of corn ; and again , even if all these things should turn out contrary to their expectation , yet they were very powerful in their navy .
<start> Pedestria esse itinera concisa aestuariis , navigationem impeditam propter inscientiam locorum paucitatemque portuum sciebant , neque nostros exercitus propter inopiam frumenti diutius apud se morari posse confidebant ; ac iam ut omnia contra opinionem acciderent , tamen se plurimum navibus posse , Romanos neque ullam facultatem habere navium , neque eorum locorum ubi bellum gesturi essent vada , portus , insulas novisse ; ac longe aliam esse navigationem in concluso mari atque in vastissimo atque apertissimo Oceano perspiciebant . <end>$$They well understood that the Romans neither had any number of ships , nor were acquainted with the shallows , the harbors , or the islands of those parts where they would have to carry on the war ; and the navigation was very different in a narrow sea from what it was in the vast and open ocean .
<start> His initis consiliis oppida muniunt , frumenta ex agris in oppida comportant , naves in Venetiam , ubi Caesarem primum bellum gesturum constabat , quam plurimas possunt cogunt . <end>$$Having come to this resolution , they fortify their towns , convey corn into them from the country parts , bring together as many ships as possible to Venetia , where it appeared Caesar would at first carry on the war .
<start> Erant hae difficultates belli gerendi quas supra ostendimus , sed tamen multa Caesarem ad id bellum incitabant : iniuria retentorum equitum Romanorum , rebellio facta post deditionem , defectio datis obsidibus , tot civitatum coniuratio , in primis ne hac parte neglecta reliquae nationes sibi idem licere arbitrarentur . <end>$$There were these difficulties which we have mentioned above , in carrying on the war , but many things , nevertheless , urged Caesar to that war ; —the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the Roman knights , the rebellion raised after surrendering , the revolt after hostages were given , the confederacy of so many states , but principally , lest if , this part was overlooked , the other nations should think that the same thing was permitted them .
<start> Itaque cum intellegeret omnes fere Gallos novis rebus studere et ad bellum mobiliter celeriterque excitari , omnes autem homines natura libertati studere et condicionem servitutis odisse , prius quam plures civitates conspirarent , partiendum sibi ac latius distribuendum exercitum putavit . <end>$$Wherefore , since he reflected that almost all the Gauls were fond of revolution , and easily and quickly excited to war ; that all men likewise , by nature , love liberty and hate the condition of slavery , he thought he ought to divide and more widely distribute his army , before more states should join the confederation .
<start> Itaque Titus Labienum legatum in Treveros , qui proximi flumini Rheno sunt , cum equitatu mittit . <end>$$He therefore sends Titus Labienus , his legate , with the cavalry to the Treveri , who are nearest to the river Rhine .
<start> Huic mandat , Remos reliquosque Belgas adeat atque in officio contineat Germanosque , qui auxilio a Belgis arcessiti dicebantur , si per vim navibus flumen transire conentur , prohibeat . <end>$$He charges him to visit the Remi and the other Belgae , and to keep them in their allegiance and repel the Germans if they attempted to cross the river by force in their ships .
<start> Publius Crassum cum cohortibus legionariis XII et magno numero equitatus in Aquitaniam proficisci iubet , ne ex his nationibus auxilia in Galliam mittantur ac tantae nationes coniungantur . <end>$$He orders Publius Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with twelve legionary cohorts and a great number of the cavalry , lest auxiliaries should be sent into Gaul by these states , and such great nations be united .
<start> Quintus Titurium Sabinum legatum cum legionibus tribus in Venellos , Coriosolites Lexoviosque mittit , qui eam manum distinendam curet . <end>$$He sends Quintus Titurius Sabinus his legate , with three legions , among the Venelli , the Coriosolitae , and the Lexovii , to take care that their forces should be kept separate from the rest .
<start> D Brutum adulescentem classi Gallicisque navibus , quas ex Pictonibus et Santonis reliquisque pacatis regionibus convenire iusserat , praeficit et , cum primum possit , in Venetos proficisci iubet . <end>$$He appoints Decimus Brutus , a young man , over the fleet and those Gallic vessels which he had ordered to be furnished by the Pictones and the Santoni , and the other provinces which remained at peace ; and commands him to proceed toward the Veneti , as soon as he could .
<start> Ipse eo pedestribus copiis contendit . <end>$$He himself hastens thither with the land forces .
<start> Erant eius modi fere situs oppidorum ut posita in extremis lingulis promunturiisque neque pedibus aditum haberent , cum ex alto se aestus incitavisset , quod accidit semper horarum XII spatio , neque navibus , quod rursus minuente aestu naves in vadis adflictarentur . <end>$$The sites of their towns were generally such that , being placed on extreme points and on promontories , they neither had an approach by land when the tide had rushed in from the main ocean , which always happens twice in the space of twelve hours ; nor by ships , because , upon the tide ebbing again , the ships were likely to be dashed upon the shoals .
<start> Ita utraque re oppidorum oppugnatio impediebatur Ac si quando magnitudine operis forte superati , extruso mari aggere ac molibus atque his oppidi moenibus adaequatis , suis fortunis desperare coeperant , magno numero navium adpulso , cuius rei summam facultatem habebant , omnia sua deportabant seque in proxima oppida recipiebant : ibi se rursus isdem oportunitatibus loci defendebant . <end>$$Thus , by either circumstance , was the storming of their towns rendered difficult ; and if at any time perchance the Veneti overpowered by the greatness of our works , had begun to despair of their fortunes ; bringing up a large number of ships , of which they had a very great quantity , they carried off all their property and betook themselves to the nearest towns ; there they again defended themselves by the same advantages of situation .
<start> Haec eo facilius magnam partem aestatis faciebant quod nostrae naves tempestatibus detinebantur summaque erat vasto atque aperto mari , magnis aestibus , raris ac prope nullis portibus difficultas navigandi . <end>$$They did this the more easily during a great part of the summer , because our ships were kept back by storms , and the difficulty of sailing was very great in that vast and open sea , with its strong tides and its harbors far apart and exceedingly few in number .
<start> Namque ipsorum naves ad hunc modum factae armataeque erant : carinae aliquanto planiores quam nostrarum navium , quo facilius vada ac decessum aestus excipere possent ; prorae admodum erectae atque item puppes , ad magnitudinem fluctuum tempestatumque accommodatae ; naves totae factae ex robore ad quamvis vim et contumeliam perferendam ; transtra ex pedalibus in altitudinem trabibus , confixa clavis ferreis digiti pollicis crassitudine ; ancorae pro funibus ferreis catenis revinctae ; pelles pro velis alutaeque tenuiter confectae , sive propter inopiam lini atque eius usus inscientiam , sive eo , quod est magis veri simile , quod tantas tempestates Oceani tantosque impetus ventorum sustineri ac tanta onera navium regi velis non satis commode posse arbitrabantur . <end>$$For their ships were built and equipped after this manner The keels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships , whereby they could more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide : the prows were raised very high , and , in like manner the sterns were adapted to the force of the waves and storms The ships were built wholly of oak , and designed to endure any force and violence whatever ; the benches which were made of planks a foot in breadth , were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb ; the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables , and for sails they used skins and thin dressed leather .
<start> Cum his navibus nostrae classi eius modi congressus erat ut una celeritate et pulsu remorum praestaret , reliqua pro loci natura , pro vi tempestatum illis essent aptiora et accommodatiora . <end>$$These either through their want of canvas and their ignorance of its application , or for this reason , which is more probable , that they thought that such storms of the ocean , and such violent gales of wind could not be resisted by sails , nor ships of such great burden be conveniently enough managed by them .
<start> Accedebat ut , cum se vento dedissent , et tempestatem ferrent facilius et in vadis consisterent tutius et ab aestu relictae nihil saxa et cotes timerent ; quarum rerum omnium nostris navibus casus erat extimescendus . <end>$$To this was added , that whenever a storm began to rage and they ran before the wind , they both could weather the storm more easily and heave to securely in the shallows , and when left by the tide feared nothing from rocks and shelves : the risk of all which things was much to be dreaded by our ships .
<start> Compluribus expugnatis oppidis Caesar , ubi intellexit frustra tantum laborem sumi neque hostium fugam captis oppidis reprimi neque iis noceri posse , statuit expectandam classem . <end>$$Caesar , after taking many of their towns , perceiving that so much labor was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be prevented on the capture of their towns , and that injury could not be done them , he determined to wait for his fleet .
<start> Quae ubi convenit ac primum ab hostibus visa est , circiter CCXX naves eorum paratissimae atque omni genere armorum ornatissimae profectae ex portu nostris adversae constiterunt ; neque satis Bruto , qui classi praeerat , vel tribunis militum centurionibusque , quibus singulae naves erant attributae , constabat quid agerent aut quam rationem pugnae insisterent Rostro enim noceri non posse cognoverant ; turribus autem excitatis tamen has altitudo puppium ex barbaris navibus superabat , ut neque ex inferiore loco satis commode tela adigi possent et missa a Gallis gravius acciderent . <end>$$As soon as it came up and was first seen by the enemy , about 220 of their ships , fully equipped and appointed with every kind of implement , sailed forth from the harbor , and drew up opposite to ours ; nor did it appear clear to Brutus , who commanded the fleet , or to the tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions , to whom the several ships were assigned , what to do , or what system of tactics to adopt ; for they knew that damage could not be done by their beaks ; and that , although turrets were built , yet the height of the stems of the barbarian ships exceeded these ; so that weapons could not be cast up from lower position with sufficient effect , and those cast by the Gauls fell the more forcibly upon us .
<start> Una erat magno usui res praeparata a nostris , falces praeacutae insertae adfixaeque longuriis , non absimili forma muralium falcium . <end>$$One thing provided by our men was of great service , sharp hooks inserted into and fastened upon poles , of a form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls .
<start> His cum funes qui antemnas ad malos destinabant comprehensi adductique erant , navigio remis incitato praerumpebantur Quibus abscisis antemnae necessario concidebant , ut , cum omnis Gallicis navibus spes in velis armamentisque consisteret , his ereptis omnis usus navium uno tempore eriperetur . <end>$$When the ropes which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by them and pulled , and our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars , they were severed ; and when they were cut away , the yards necessarily fell down ; so that as all the hope of the Gallic vessels depended on their sails and rigging , upon these being cut away , the entire management of the ships was taken from them at the same time .
<start> Reliquum erat certamen positum in virtute , qua nostri milites facile superabant , atque eo magis quod in conspectu Caesaris atque omnis exercitus res gerebatur , ut nullum paulo fortius factum latere posset ; omnes enim colles ac loca superiora , unde erat propinquus despectus in mare , ab exercitu tenebantur . <end>$$The rest of the contest depended on courage ; in which our men decidedly had the advantage ; and the more so , because the whole action was carried on in the sight of Caesar and the entire army ; so that no act , a little more valiant than ordinary , could pass unobserved , for all the hills and higher grounds , from which there was a near prospect of the sea were occupied by our army .
<start> Deiectis , ut diximus , antemnis , cum singulas binae ac ternae naves circumsteterant , milites summa vi transcendere in hostium naves contendebant Quod postquam barbari fieri animadverterunt , expugnatis compluribus navibus , cum ei rei nullum reperiretur auxilium , fuga salutem petere contenderunt . <end>$$The sail yards , as we have said , being brought down , although two and three ships surrounded each one , the soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the ships of the enemy ; and , after the barbarians observed this taking place , as a great many of their ships were beaten , and as no relief for that evil could be discovered , they hastened to seek safety in flight .
<start> Quo proelio bellum Venetorum totiusque orae maritimae confectum est Nam cum omnis iuventus , omnes etiam gravioris aetatis in quibus aliquid consilii aut dignitatis fuit eo convenerant , tum navium quod ubique fuerat in unum locum coegerant ; quibus amissis reliqui neque quo se reciperent neque quem ad modum oppida defenderent habebant . <end>$$By this battle the war with the Veneti and the whole of the sea coast was finished ; for both all the youth , and all , too , of more advanced age , in whom there was any discretion or rank , had assembled in that battle ; and they had collected in that one place whatever naval forces they had anywhere ; and when these were lost , the survivors had no place to retreat to , nor means of defending their towns .
<start> Itaque se suaque omnia Caesari dediderunt In quos eo gravius Caesar vindicandum statuit quo diligentius in reliquum tempus a barbaris ius legatorum conservaretur Itaque omni senatu necato reliquos sub corona vendidit . <end>$$They accordingly surrendered themselves and all their possessions to Caesar , on whom Caesar thought that punishment should be inflicted the more severely , in order that for the future the rights of embassadors might be more carefully respected by barbarians ; having , therefore , put to death all their senate , he sold the rest for slaves .
<start> Dum haec in Venetis geruntur , Quintus Titurius Sabinus cum iis copiis quas a Caesare acceperat in fines Venellorum pervenit . <end>$$While these things are going on among the Veneti , Quintus Titurius Sabinus with those troops which he had received from Caesar , arrives in the territories of the Venelli .
<start> His praeerat Viridovix ac summam imperii tenebat earum omnium civitatum quae defecerant , ex quibus exercitum coegerat ; atque his paucis diebus Aulerci Eburovices Lexoviique , senatu suo interfecto quod auctores belli esse nolebant , portas clauserunt seque cum Viridovice coniunxerunt ; magnaque praeterea multitudo undique ex Gallia perditorum hominum latronumque convenerat , quos spes praedandi studiumque bellandi ab agri cultura et cotidiano labore revocabat . <end>$$Over these people Viridovix ruled , and held the chief command of all those states which had revolted ; from which he had collected a large and powerful army And in those few days , the Aulerci and the Lexovii , having slain their senate because they would not consent to be promoters of the war , shut their gates and united themselves to Viridovix ; a great multitude besides of desperate men and robbers assembled out of Gaul from all quarters , whom the hope of plundering and the love of fighting had called away from husbandry and their daily labor .
<start> Sabinus idoneo omnibus rebus loco castris sese tenebat , cum Viridovix contra eum duorum milium spatio consedisset cotidieque productis copiis pugnandi potestatem faceret , ut iam non solum hostibus in contemptionem Sabinus veniret , sed etiam nostrorum militum vocibus non nihil carperetur ; tantamque opinionem timoris praebuit ut iam ad vallum castrorum hostes accedere auderent . <end>$$Sabinus kept himself within his camp , which was in a position convenient for everything ; while Viridovix encamped over against him at a distance of two miles , and daily bringing out his forces , gave him an opportunity of fighting ; so that Sabinus had now not only come into contempt with the enemy , but also was somewhat taunted by the speeches of our soldiers ; and furnished so great a suspicion of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to approach even to the very rampart of our camp .
<start> Id ea de causa faciebat quod cum tanta multitudine hostium , praesertim eo absente qui summam imperii teneret , nisi aequo loco aut oportunitate aliqua data legato dimicandum non existimabat . <end>$$He adopted this conduct for the following reason : because he did not think that a legate ought to engage in battle with so great a force , especially while he who held the chief command was absent , except on advantageous ground or some favorable circumstance presented itself .
<start> Hac confirmata opinione timoris idoneum quendam hominem et callidum deligit , Gallum , ex iis quos auxilii causa secum habebat . <end>$$After having established this suspicion of his cowardice , he selected a certain suitable and crafty Gaul , who was one of those whom he had with him as auxiliaries .
<start> Huic magnis praemiis pollicitationibusque persuadet uti ad hostes transeat , et quid fieri velit edocet . <end>$$He induces him by great gifts and promises to go over to the enemy ; and informs of what he wished to be done .
<start> Qui ubi pro perfuga ad eos venit , timorem Romanorum proponit , quibus angustiis ipse Caesar a Venetis prematur docet , eque longius abesse quin proxima nocte Sabinus clam ex castris exercitum educat et ad Caesarem auxilii ferendi causa proficiscatur Quod ubi auditum est , conclamant omnes occasionem negotii bene gerendi amittendam non esse : ad castra iri oportere . <end>$$Who , when he arrives among them as a deserter , lays before them the fears of the Romans ; and informs them by what difficulties Caesar himself was harassed , and that the matter was not far removed from this—that Sabinus would the next night privately draw off his army out of the camp and set forth to Caesar for the purpose of carrying assistance , which , when they heard , they all cry out together that an opportunity of successfully conducting their enterprise , ought not to be thrown away : that they ought to go to the camp .
<start> Multae res ad hoc consilium Gallos hortabantur : superiorum dierum Sabini cunctatio , perfugae confirmatio , inopia cibariorum , cui rei parum diligenter ab iis erat provisum , spes Venetici belli , et quod fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt . <end>$$Many things persuaded the Gauls to this measure ; the delay of Sabinus during the previous days ; the positive assertion of the deserter ; want of provisions , for a supply of which they had not taken the requisite precautions ; the hope springing from the Venetic war ; and because in most cases men willingly believe what they wish .
<start> His rebus adducti non prius Viridovicem reliquosque duces ex concilio dimittunt quam ab iis sit concessum arma uti capiant et ad castra contendant Qua re concessa laeti , ut explorata victoria , sarmentis virgultisque collectis , quibus fossas Romanorum compleant , ad castra pergunt . <end>$$Influenced by these things they do not discharge Viridovix and the other leaders from the council , before they gained permission from them to take up arms and hasten to camp ; which being granted , rejoicing as if victory were fully certain , they collected faggots and brushwood , with which to fill up the Roman trenches , and hasten to the camp .
<start> Locus erat castrorum editus et paulatim ab imo acclivis circiter passus mille . <end>$$The situation of the camp was a rising ground , gently sloping from the bottom for about a mile .
<start> Huc magno cursu contenderunt , ut quam minimum spatii ad se colligendos armandosque Romanis daretur , exanimatique pervenerunt . <end>$$Thither they proceeded with great speed , and arrived quite out of breath .
<start> Sabinus suos hortatus cupientibus signum dat Impeditis hostibus propter ea quae ferebant onera subito duabus portis eruptionem fieri iubet . <end>$$Sabinus having encouraged his men , gives them the signal , which they earnestly desired .
<start> Factum est oportunitate loci , hostium inscientia ac defatigatione , virtute militum et superiorum pugnarum exercitatione , ut ne unum quidem nostrorum impetum ferrent ac statim terga verterent . <end>$$While the enemy were encumbered by reason of the burdens which they were carrying , he orders a sally to be made suddenly from two gates  .
<start> Quos impeditos integris viribus milites nostri consecuti magnum numerum eorum occiderunt ; reliquos equites consectati paucos , qui ex fuga evaserant , reliquerunt Sic uno tempore et de navali pugna Sabinus et de Sabini victoria Caesar est certior factus , civitatesque omnes se statim Titurio dediderunt . <end>$$It happened , by the advantage of situation , by the unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy , by the valor of our soldiers , and their experience in former battles , that they could not stand one attack of our men , and immediately turned their backs ; and our men with full vigor followed them while disordered , and slew a great number of them ; the horse pursuing the rest , left but few , who escaped by flight .
<start> Eodem fere tempore Publius Crassus , cum in Aquitaniam pervenisset , quae , ut ante dictum est , tertia pars Galliae est , cum intellegeret in iis locis sibi bellum gerendum ubi paucis ante annis Lucius Valerius Praeconinus legatus exercitu pulso interfectus esset atque unde Lucius Manlius proconsul impedimentis amissis profugisset , non mediocrem sibi diligentiam adhibendam intellegebat . <end>$$About the same time , Publius Crassus , when he had arrived in Aquitania understanding that he was to wage war in these parts , where a few years before , Lucius Valerius Praeconinus , the legate had been killed , and his army routed , and from which Lucius Manilius , the proconsul , had fled with the loss of his baggage , he perceived that no ordinary care must be used by him .
<start> Itaque re frumentaria provisa , auxiliis equitatuque comparato , multis praeterea viris fortibus Tolosa et Carcasone et Narbone , quae sunt civitates Galliae provinciae finitimae , ex his regionibus nominatim evocatis , in Sotiatium fines exercitum introduxit . <end>$$Wherefore , having provided corn , procured auxiliaries and cavalry , having summoned by name many valiant men from Tolosa , Carcaso , and Narbo , which are the states of the province of Gaul , that border on these regions , he led his army into the territories of the Sotiates .
<start> Cuius adventu cognito Sotiates magnis copiis coactis , equitatuque , quo plurimum valebant , in itinere agmen nostrum adorti primum equestre proelium commiserunt , deinde equitatu suo pulso atque insequentibus nostris subito pedestres copias , quas in convalle in insidiis conlocaverant , ostenderunt . <end>$$On his arrival being known , the Sotiates having brought together great forces and cavalry , in which their strength principally lay , and assailing our army on the march , engaged first in a cavalry action , then when their cavalry was routed , and our men pursuing , they suddenly display their infantry forces , which they had placed in ambuscade in a valley .
<start> Hi nostros disiectos adorti proelium renovarunt . <end>$$These attacked our men disordered , and renewed the fight .
<start> Pugnatum est diu atque acriter , cum Sotiates superioribus victoriis freti in sua virtute totius Aquitaniae salutem positam putarent , nostri autem quid sine imperatore et sine reliquis legionibus adulescentulo duce efficere possent perspici cuperent ; tandem confecti vulneribus hostes terga verterunt . <end>$$The battle was long and vigorously contested , since the Sotiates , relying on their former victories , imagined that the safety of the whole of Aquitania rested on their valor ; our men , on the other hand , desired it might be seen what they could accomplish without their general and without the other legions , under a very young commander ; at length the enemy , worn out with wounds , began to turn their backs , and a great number of them being slain , Crassus began to besiege the town of the Sotiates on his march .
<start> Quorum magno numero interfecto Crassus ex itinere oppidum Sotiatium oppugnare coepit . <end>$$Upon their valiantly resisting , he raised vineae and turrets .
<start> Qua re impetrata arma tradere iussi faciunt Atque in eam rem omnium nostrorum intentis animis alia ex parte oppidi Adiatunnus , qui summam imperii tenebat , cum DC devotis , quos illi soldurios appellant , quorum haec est condicio , ut omnibus in vita commodis una cum iis fruantur quorum se amicitiae dediderint , si quid his per vim accidat , aut eundem casum una ferant aut sibi mortem consciscant ; neque adhuc hominum memoria repertus est quisquam qui , eo interfecto cuius se amicitiae devovisset , mortem recusaret--- cum his Adiatunnus eruptionem facere conatus clamore ab ea parte munitionis sublato cum ad arma milites concurrissent vehementerque ibi pugnatum esset , repulsus in oppidum tamen uti eadem deditionis condicione uteretur a Crasso impetravit . <end>$$And while the attention of our men is engaged in that matter , in another part Adiatunnus , who held the chief command , with 600 devoted followers whom they call soldurii ; Adiatunnus , endeavoring to make a sally with these , when our soldiers had rushed together to arms , upon a shout being raised at that part of the , fortification , and a fierce battle had been fought there , was driven back into the town , yet he obtained from Crassus that he should enjoy the same terms of surrender  .
<start> Armis obsidibusque acceptis , Crassus in fines Vocatium et Tarusatium profectus est . <end>$$Crassus , having received their arms and hostages , marched into the territories of the Vocates and the Tarusates .
<start> Tum vero barbari commoti , quod oppidum et natura loci et manu munitum paucis diebus quibus eo ventum erat expugnatum cognoverant , legatos quoque versus dimittere , coniurare , obsides inter se dare , copias parare coeperunt . <end>$$But then , the barbarians being alarmed , because they had heard that a town fortified by the nature of the place and by art , had been taken by us in a few days after our arrival there , began to send embassadors into all quarters , to combine , to give hostages one to another , to raise troops .
<start> Mittuntur etiam ad eas civitates legati quae sunt citerioris Hispaniae finitimae Aquitaniae : inde auxilia ducesque arcessuntur . <end>$$Embassadors also are sent to those states of Hither Spain which are nearest to Aquitania , and auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them ; on whose arrival they proceed to carry on the war with great confidence , and with a great host of men .
<start> Quorum adventu magna cum auctoritate et magna hominum multitudine bellum gerere conantur . <end>$$They who had been with Quintus Sertorius the whole period and were supposed to have very great skill in military matters , are chosen leaders .
<start> Duces vero ii deliguntur qui una cum Quintus Sertorio omnes annos fuerant summamque scientiam rei militaris habere existimabantur Hi consuetudine populi Romani loca capere , castra munire , commeatibus nostros intercludere instituunt Quod ubi Crassus animadvertit , suas copias propter exiguitatem non facile diduci , hostem et vagari et vias obsidere et castris satis praesidii relinquere , ob eam causam minus commode frumentum commeatumque sibi supportari , in dies hostium numcrum augeri , non cunctandum existimavit quin pugna decertaret . <end>$$These , adopting the practice of the Roman people , begin to select places , to fortify their camp , to cut off our men from provisions , which , when Crassus observes , that his forces , on account of their small number could not safely be separated ; that the enemy both made excursions and beset the passes , and left sufficient guard for their camp ; that on that account , corn and provision could not very conveniently be brought up to him , and that the number of the enemy was daily increased , he thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle .
<start> Hac re ad consilium delata , ubi omnes idem sentire intellexit , posterum diem pugnae constituit . <end>$$This matter being brought to a council , when he discovered that all thought the same thing , he appointed the next day for the fight .
<start> Prima luce productis omnibus copiis duplici acie instituta , auxiliis in mediam aciem coniectis , quid hostes consilii caperent expectabat . <end>$$Having drawn out all his forces at the break of day , and marshaled them in a double line , he posted the auxiliaries in the center , and waited to see what measures the enemy would take .
<start> Ibi cum alii fossas complerent , alii multis telis coniectis defensores vallo munitionibusque depellerent , auxiliaresque , quibus ad pugnam non multum Crassus confidebat , lapidibus telisque subministrandis et ad aggerem caespitibus comportandis speciem atque opinionem pugnantium praeberent , cum item ab hostibus constanter ac non timide pugnaretur telaque ex loco superiore missa non frustra acciderent , equites circumitis hostium castris Crasso renuntiaverunt non eadem esse diligentia ab decumana porta castra munita facilemque aditum habere . <end>$$There , while some were filling up the ditch , and others , by throwing a large number of darts , were driving the defenders from the rampart and fortifications , and the auxiliaries , on whom Crassus did not much rely in the battle , by supplying stones and weapons , and by conveying turf to the mound , presented the appearance and character of men engaged in fighting ; while also the enemy were fighting resolutely and boldly , and their weapons , discharged from their higher position , fell with great effect ; the horse , having gone round the camp of the enemy , reported to Crassus that the camp was not fortified with equal care on the side of the Decuman gate , and had an easy approach .
<start> Crassus equitum praefectos cohortatus , ut magnis praemiis pollicitationibusque suos excitarent , quid fieri vellet ostendit . <end>$$Crassus , having exhorted the commanders of the horse to animate their men by great rewards and promises , points out to them what he wished to have done .
<start> Illi , ut erat imperatum , eductis iis cohortibus quae praesidio castris relictae intritae ab labore erant , et longiore itinere circumductis , ne ex hostium castris conspici possent , omnium oculis mentibusque ad pugnam intentis celeriter ad eas quas diximus munitiones pervenerunt atque his prorutis prius in hostium castris constiterunt quam plane ab his videri aut quid rei gereretur cognosci posset . <end>$$They , as they had been commanded , having brought out the four cohorts , which , as they had been left as a guard for the camp , were not fatigued by exertion , and having led them round by a some what longer way , lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy , when the eyes and minds of all were intent upon the battle , quickly arrived at those fortifications which we have spoken of , and , having demolished these , stood in the camp of the enemy before they were seen by them , or it was known what was going on .
<start> Tum vero clamore ab ea parte audito nostri redintegratis viribus , quod plerumque in spe victoriae accidere consuevit , acrius impugnare coeperunt . <end>$$And then , a shout being heard in that quarter , our men , their strength having been recruited , , began to fight more vigorously .
<start> Hostes undique circumventi desperatis omnibus rebus se per munitiones deicere et fuga salutem petere contenderunt . <end>$$The enemy surrounded on all sides , all their affairs being despaired of , made great attempts to cast themselves down over the ramparts and to seek safety in flight .
<start> Quos equitatus apertissimis campis consectatus ex milium L numero , quae ex Aquitania Cantabrisque convenisse constabat , vix quarta parte relicta , multa nocte se in castra recepit . <end>$$These the cavalry pursued over the very open plains , and after leaving scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50 , 000 , which it was certain had assembled out of Aquitania and from the Cantabri , returned late at night to the camp .
<start> Eodem fere tempore Caesar , etsi prope exacta iam aestas erat , tamen , quod omni Gallia pacata Morini Menapiique supererant , qui in armis essent neque ad eum umquam legatos de pace misissent , arbitratus id bellum celeriter confici posse eo exercitum duxit ; qui longe alia ratione ac reliqui Galli bellum gerere coeperunt . <end>$$About the same time Caesar , although the summer was nearly past , yet , since , all Gaul being reduced , the Morini and the Menapii alone remained in arms , and had never sent embassadors to him of peace , speedily led his army thither , thinking that that war might soon be terminated .
<start> Nam quod intellegebant maximas nationes , quae proelio contendissent , pulsas superatasque esse , continentesque silvas ac paludes habebant , eo se suaque omnia contulerunt . <end>$$They resolved to conduct the war on a very different method from the rest of the Gauls ; for as they perceived that the greatest nations who had engaged in war , had been routed and overcome , and as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and morasses , they removed themselves and all their property thither .
<start> Ad quarum initium silvarum cum Caesar pervenisset castraque munire instituisset neque hostis interim visus esset , dispersis in opere nostris subito ex omnibus partibus silvae evolaverunt et in nostros impetum fecerunt . <end>$$When Caesar had arrived at the opening of these forests , and had began to fortify his camp , and no enemy was in the mean time seen , while our men were dispersed on their respective duties , they suddenly rushed out from all parts of the forest , and made an attack on our men .
<start> Nostri celeriter arma ceperunt eosque in silvas repulerunt et compluribus interfectis longius impeditioribus locis secuti paucos ex suis deperdiderunt . <end>$$The latter quickly took up arms and drove them back again to their forests ; and having killed a great many , lost a few of their own men while pursuing them too far through those intricate places .
<start> Reliquis deinceps diebus Caesar silvas caedere instituit , et ne quis inermibus imprudentibusque militibus ab latere impetus fieri posset , omnem eam materiam quae erat caesa conversam ad hostem conlocabat et pro vallo ad utrumque latus extruebat . <end>$$During the remaining days after this , Caesar began to cut down the forests ; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the soldiers , while unarmed and not foreseeing it , he placed together all that timber which was cut down , and piled it up as a rampart on either flank .
<start> Incredibili celeritate magno spatio paucis diebus confecto , cum iam pecus atque extrema impedimenta a nostris tenerentur , ipsi densiores silvas peterent , eius modi sunt tempestates consecutae uti opus necessario intermitteretur et continuatione imbrium diutius sub pellibus milites contineri non possent . <end>$$When a great space had been , with incredible speed , cleared in a few days , when the cattle and the rear of their baggage train were already seized by our men , and they themselves were seeking for the thickest parts of the forests , storms of such a kind came on that the work was necessarily suspended , and , through the continuance of the rains , the soldiers could not any longer remain in their tents .
<start> Itaque vastatis omnibus eorum agris , vicis aedificiisque incensis , Caesar exercitum reduxit et in Aulercis Lexoviisque , reliquis item civitatibus quae proxime bellum fecerant , in hibernis conlocavit . <end>$$Therefore , having laid waste all their country , having burned their villages and houses , Caesar led back his army and stationed them in winter quarters among the Aulerci and Lexovii , and the other states which had made war upon him last .
<start> Ea quae secuta est hieme , qui fuit annus Gnaeus Pompeio , Marcus Crasso consulibus , Usipetes Germani et item Tencteri magna multitudine hominum flumen Rhenum transierunt , non longe a mari , quo Rhenus influit . <end>$$The following winter , those Germans the Usipetes , and likewise the Tencteri , with a great number of men , crossed the Rhine , not far from the place at which that river discharges itself into the sea .
<start> Causa transeundi fuit quod ab Suebis complures annos exagitati bello premebantur et agri cultura prohibebantur . <end>$$The motive for crossing was , that having been for several years harassed by the Suevi , they were constantly engaged in war , and hindered from the pursuits of agriculture .
<start> Sueborum gens est longe maxima et bellicosissima Germanorum omnium . <end>$$The nation of the Suevi is by far the largest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans .
<start> Reliqui , qui domi manserunt , se atque illos alunt ; hi rursus in vicem anno post in armis sunt , illi domi remanent . <end>$$The latter again , in their turn , are in arms the year after : the former remain at home .
<start> Sic neque agri cultura nec ratio atque usus belli intermittitur . <end>$$Thus neither husbandry , nor the art and practice of war are neglected .
<start> Sed privati ac separati agri apud eos nihil est , neque longius anno remanere uno in loco colendi causa licet . <end>$$But among them there exists no private and separate land ; nor are they permitted to remain more than one year in one place for the purpose of residence .
<start> Neque multum frumento , sed maximam partem lacte atque pecore vivunt multum sunt in venationibus ; quae res et cibi genere et cotidiana exercitatione et libertate vitae , quod a pueris nullo officio aut disciplina adsuefacti nihil omnino contra voluntatem faciunt , et vires alit et immani corporum magnitudine homines efficit . <end>$$They do not live much on corn , but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh , and are much in hunting ; which circumstance must , by the nature of their food , and by their daily exercise and the freedom of their life , both promote their strength and render them men of vast stature of body .
<start> Atque in eam se consuetudinem adduxerunt ut locis frigidissimis neque vestitus praeter pelles habeant quicquam , quarum propter exiguitatem magna est corporis pars aperta , et laventur in fluminibus . <end>$$And to such a habit have they brought themselves , that even in the coldest parts they wear no clothing whatever except skins , by reason of the scantiness of which , a great portion of their body is bare , and besides they bathe in open rivers .
<start> Mercatoribus est aditus magis eo ut quae bello ceperint quibus vendant habeant , quam quo ullam rem ad se importari desiderent . <end>$$Merchants have access to them rather that they may have persons to whom they may sell those things which they have taken in war , than because they need any commodity to be imported to them .
<start> Quin etiam iumentis , quibus maxime Galli delectantur quaeque impenso parant pretio , Germani importatis non utuntur , sed quae sunt apud eos nata , parva atque deformia , haec cotidiana exercitatione summi ut sint laboris efficiunt . <end>$$Moreover , even as to laboring cattle , in which the Gauls take the greatest pleasure , and which they procure at a great price , the Germans do not employ such as are imported , but those poor and ill-shaped animals , which belong to their country ; these , however , they render capable of the greatest labor by daily exercise .
<start> Equestribus proeliis saepe ex equis desiliunt ac pedibus proeliantur , equos eodem remanere vestigio adsue fecerunt , ad quos se celeriter , cum usus est , recipiunt : neque eorum moribus turpius quicquam aut inertius habetur quam ephippiis uti . <end>$$In cavalry actions they frequently leap from their horses and fight on foot ; and train their horses to stand still in the very spot on which they leave them , to which they retreat with great activity when there is occasion ; nor , according to their practice , is any thing regarded as more unseemly , or more unmanly , than to use housings .
<start> Itaque ad quemvis numerum ephippiatorum equitum quamvis pauci adire audent . <end>$$Accordingly , they have the courage , though they be themselves but few , to advance against any number whatever of horse mounted with housings .
<start> Vinum omnino ad se importari non patiuntur , quod ea re ad laborem ferendum remollescere homines atque effeminari arbitrantur . <end>$$They on no account permit wine to be imported to them , because they consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring fatigue , and are rendered effeminate by that commodity .
<start> Publice maximam putant esse laudem quam latissime a suis finibus vacare agros : hac re significari magnum numerum civitatum suam vim sustinere non posse Itaque una ex parte a Suebis circiter milia passuum C agri vacare dicuntur . <end>$$They esteem it their greatest praise as a nation , that the lands about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent , inasmuch as that by this circumstance is indicated , that a great number of nations can not withstand their power ; and thus on one side of the Suevi the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred miles .
<start> Ad alteram partem succedunt Ubii , quorum fuit civitas ampla atque florens , ut est captus Germanorum ; ii paulo , quamquam sunt eiusdem generis , sunt ceteris humaniores , propterea quod Rhenum attingunt multum ad eos mercatores ventitant et ipsi propter propinquitatem Gallicis sunt moribus adsuefacti . <end>$$On the other side they border on the Ubii , whose state was large and flourishing , considering the condition of the Germans , and who are somewhat more refined than those of the same race and the rest , and that because they border on the Rhine , and are much resorted to by merchants , and are accustomed to the manners of the Gauls , by reason of their approximity to them .
<start> Hos cum Suebi multis saepe bellis experti propter amplitudinem gravitatem civitatis finibus expellere non potuissent , tamen vectigales sibi fecerunt ac multo humiliores infirmiores redegerunt . <end>$$Though the Suevi , after making the attempt frequently and in several wars , could not expel this nation from their territories , on account of the extent and population of their state , yet they made them tributaries , and rendered them less distinguished and powerful  .
<start> In eadem causa fuerunt Usipetes et Tencteri , quos supra diximus ; qui complures annos Sueborum vim sustinuerunt , ad extremum tamen agris expulsi et multis locis Germaniae triennium vagati ad Rhenum pervenerunt , quas regiones Menapii incolebant . <end>$$In the same condition were the Usipetes and the Tencteri , who , for many years , resisted the power of the Suevi , but being at last driven from their possessions , and having wandered through many parts of Germany , came to the Rhine , to districts which the Menapii inhabited , and where they had lands , houses , and villages on either side of the river .
<start> Hi ad utramque ripam fluminis agros , aedificia vicosque habebant ; sed tantae multitudinis adventu perterriti ex iis aedificiis quae trans flumen habuerant demigraverant , et cis Rhenum dispositis praesidiis Germanos transire prohibebant . <end>$$The latter people , alarmed by the arrival of so great a multitude , removed from those houses which they had on the other side of the river , and having placed guards on this side the Rhine , proceeded to hinder the Germans from crossing .
<start> Illi omnia experti , cum neque vi contendere propter inopiam navium neque clam transire propter custodias Menapiorum possent , reverti se in suas sedes regiones simulaverunt et tridui viam progressi rursus reverterunt atque omni hoc itinere una nocte equitatu confecto inscios inopinantes Menapios oppresserunt , qui de Germanorum discessu per exploratores certiores facti sine metu trans Rhenum in suos vicos remigraverant . <end>$$They , finding themselves , after they had tried all means , unable either to force a passage on account of their deficiency in shipping , or cross by stealth on account of the guards of the Menapii , pretended to return to their own settlements and districts ; and , after having proceeded three days' march , returned ; and their cavalry having performed the whole of this journey in one night , cut off the Menapii , who were ignorant of , and did not expect who , having moreover been informed of the departure of the Germans by their scouts , had , without apprehension , returned to their villages beyond the Rhine .
<start> His interfectis navibus eorum occupatis , prius quam ea pars Menapiorum quae citra Rhenum erat certior fieret , flumen transierunt atque omnibus eorum aedificiis occupatis reliquam partem hiemis se eorum copiis aluerunt . <end>$$Having slain these , and seized their ships , they crossed the river before that part of the Menapii , who were at peace in their settlements over the Rhine , were apprized of ; and seizing all their houses , maintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the winter .
<start> His de rebus Caesar certior factus et infirmitatem Gallorum veritus , quod sunt in consiliis capiendis mobiles et novis plerumque rebus student , nihil his committendum existimavit Est enim hoc Gallicae consuetudinis , uti et viatores etiam invitos consistere cogant et quid quisque eorum de quaque re audierit aut cognoverit quaerant et mercatores in oppidis vulgus circumsistat quibus ex regionibus veniant quas ibi res cognoverint pronuntiare cogat . <end>$$Caesar , when informed of these matters , fearing the fickle disposition of the Gauls , who are easily prompted to take up resolutions , and much addicted to change , considered that nothing was to be intrusted to them ; for it is the custom of that people to compel travelers to stop , even against their inclination , and inquire what they may have heard , or may know , respecting any matter ; and in towns the common people throng around merchants and force them to state from what countries they come , and what affairs they know of there .
<start> His rebus atque auditionibus permoti de summis saepe rebus consula ineunt , quorum eos in vestigio paenitere necesse est , cum incertis rumoribus serviant et pleri ad voluntatem eorum ficta respondeant . <end>$$They often engage in resolutions concerning the most important matters , induced by these reports and stories alone ; of which they must necessarily instantly repent , since they yield to mere unauthorized reports ; and since most people give to their questions answers framed agreeably to their wishes .
<start> Qua consuetudine cognita Caesar , ne graviori bello , occurreret , maturius quam consuerat ad exercitum proficiscitur . <end>$$Caesar , being aware of their custom , in order that he might not encounter a more formidable war , sets forward to the army earlier in the year than he was accustomed to do .
<start> Eo cum venisset , ea quae fore suspicatus erat facta cognovit : missas legationes ab non nullis civitatibus ad Germanos invitatos eos uti ab Rheno discederent : omnia quae postulassent ab se fore parata . <end>$$When he had arrived there , he discovered that those things , which he had suspected would occur , had taken place ; that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the states , and that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine , and had been promised that all things which they desired should be provided by the Gauls .
<start> Qua spe adducti Germani latius iam vagabantur et in fines Eburonum et Condrusorum , qui sunt Treverorum clientes , pervenerant . <end>$$Allured by this hope , the Germans were then making excursions to greater distances , and had advanced to the territories of the Eburones and the Condrusi , who are under the protection of the Treveri .
<start> Principibus Galliae evocatis Caesar ea quae cognoverat dissimulanda sibi existimavit , eorumque animis permulsis et confirmatis equitatu imperato bellum cum Germanis gerere constituit . <end>$$After summoning the chiefs of Gaul , Caesar thought proper to pretend ignorance of the things which he had discovered ; and having conciliated and confirmed their minds , and ordered some cavalry to be raised , resolved to make war against the Germans .
<start> Re frumentaria comparata equitibusque delectis iter in ea loca facere coepit , quibus in locis esse Germanos audiebat . <end>$$Having provided corn and selected his cavalry , he began to direct his march toward those parts in which he heard the Germans were .
<start> A quibus cum paucorum dierum iter abesset , legati ab iis venerunt , quorum haec fuit oratio : Germanos neque priores populo Romano bellum inferre neque tamen recusare , si lacessantur , quin armis contendant , quod Germanorum consuetudo sit a maioribus tradita , quicumque bellum inferant , resistere neque deprecari . <end>$$When he was distant from them only a few days' march , ambassadors came to him from their state , whose speech was as follows : That the Germans neither make war upon the Roman people first , nor do they decline , if they are provoked , to engage with them in arms ; for that this was the custom of the Germans handed down to them from their forefathers , —to resist whatsoever people make war upon them and not to avert it by entreaty ; this , however , they confessed , —that they had come hither reluctantly , having been expelled from their country .
<start> Haec tamen dicere venisse invitos , eiectos domo ; si suam gratiam Romani velint , posse iis utiles esse amicos ; vel sibi agros attribuant vel patiantur eos tenere quos armis possederint : sese unis Suebis concedere , quibus ne di quidem immortales pares esse possint ; reliquum quidem in terris esse neminem quem non superare possint . <end>$$If the Romans were disposed to accept their friendship , they might be serviceable allies to them ; and let them either assign them lands , or permit them to retain those which they had acquired by their arms ; that they are inferior to the Suevi alone , to whom not even the immortal gods can show themselves equal ; that there was none at all besides on earth whom they could not conquer .
<start> Ad haec Caesar quae visum est respondit ; sed exitus fuit orationis : sibi nullam cum iis amicitiam esse posse , si in Gallia remanerent ; neque verum esse , qui suos fines tueri non potuerint alienos occupare ; neque ullos in Gallia vacare agros qui dari tantae praesertim multitudini sine iniuria possint ; sed licere , si velint , in Ubiorum finibus considere , quorum sint legati apud se et de Sueborum iniuriis querantur et a se auxilium petant : hoc se Ubiis imperaturus . <end>$$To these remarks Caesar replied in such terms as he thought proper ; but the conclusion of his speech was , That he could make no alliance with them , if they continued in Gaul ; that it was not probable that they who were not able to defend their own territories , should get possession of those of others , nor were there any lands lying waste in Gaul , which could be given away , especially to so great a number of men , without doing wrong ; but they might , if they were desirous , settle in the territories of the Ubii ; whose ambassadors were then with him , and were complaining of the aggressions of the Suevi , and requesting assistance from him ; and that he would obtain this request from them .
<start> Legati haec se ad suos relaturos dixerunt et re deliberata post diem tertium ad Caesarem reversuros : interea ne propius se castra moveret petierunt . <end>$$The embassadors said that they would report these things to their country men ; and , after having deliberated on the matter , would return to Caesar after the third day , they begged that he would not in the mean time advance his camp nearer to them .
<start> Cognoverat enim magnam partem equitatus ab iis aliquot diebus ante praedandi frumentandi causa ad Ambivaritos trans Mosam missam : hos expectari equites atque eius rei causa moram interponi arbitrabatur . <end>$$He supposed that they were then waiting for these horse , and that the delay was caused on this account .
<start> Caesar cum ab hoste non amplius passuum XII : milibus abesset , ut erat constitutum , ad eum legati revertuntur ; qui in itinere congressi magnopere ne longius progrederetur orabant . <end>$$When Caesar was not more than twelve miles distant from the enemy , the ambassadors return to him , as had been arranged ; who meeting him on the march , earnestly entreated him not to advance any further .
<start> Cum id non impetrassent , petebant uti ad eos qui agmen antecessissent praemitteret eos pugna prohiberet , sibique ut potestatem faceret in Ubios legatos mittendi ; quorum si principes ac senatus sibi iure iurando fidem fecisset , ea condicione quae a Caesare ferretur se usuros ostendebant : ad has res conficiendas sibi tridui spatium daret . <end>$$When they could not obtain this , they begged him to send on a dispatch to those who had marched in advance of the main army , and forbid them to engage ; and grant them permission to send embassadors to the Ubii , and if the princes and senate of the latter would give them security by oath , they assured Caesar that they would accept such conditions as might be proposed by him ; and requested that he would give them the space of three days for negotiating these affairs .
<start> Haec omnia Caesar eodem illo pertinere arbitrabatur ut tridui mora interposita equites eorum qui abessent reverterentur ; tamen sese non longius milibus passuum IIII aquationis causa processurum eo die dixit : huc postero die quam frequentissimi convenirent , ut de eorum postulatis cognosceret . <end>$$Caesar thought that these things tended to the self-same point ; that , in consequence of a delay of three days intervening , their horse , which were at a distance , might return ; however , he said , that he would not that day advance further than four miles for the purpose of procuring water ; he ordered that they should assemble at that place in as large a number as possible , the following day , that he might inquire into their demands .
<start> Interim ad praefectos , qui cum omni equitatu antecesserant , mittit qui nuntiarent ne hostes proelio lacesserent , et si ipsi lacesserentur , sustinerent quoad ipse cum exercitu propius accessisset . <end>$$In the mean time he sends messengers to the officers who had marched in advance with all the cavalry , to order them not to provoke the enemy to an engagement , and if they themselves were assailed , to sustain the attack until he came up with the army .
<start> At hostes , ubi primum nostros equites conspexerunt , quorum erat V milium numerus , cum ipsi non amplius DCCC equites haberent , quod ii qui frumentandi causa erant trans Mosam profecti nondum redierant , nihil timentibus nostris , quod legati eorum paulo ante a Caesare discesserant atque is dies indutiis erat ab his petitus , impetu facto celeriter nostros perturbaverunt ; rursus his resistentibus consuetudine sua ad pedes desiluerunt subfossis equis compluribus nostris deiectis reliquos in fugam coniecerunt atque ita perterritos egerunt ut non prius fuga desisterent quam in conspectum agminis nostri venissent . <end>$$But the enemy , as soon as they saw our horse , the number of which was 5000 , whereas they themselves had not more than 800 horse , because those which had gone over the Meuse for the purpose of foraging had not returned , while our men had no apprehensions , because their embassadors had gone away from Caesar a little before , and that day had been requested by them as a period of truce , made an onset on our men , and soon threw them into disorder .
<start> In eo proelio ex equitibus nostris interficiuntur IIII et LXX , in his vir fortissimus Piso Aquitanus , amplissimo genere natus , cuius avus in civitate sua regnum obtinuerat amicus a senatu nostro appellatus . <end>$$In that encounter seventy-four of our horse were slain ; among them , Piso , an Aquitanian , a most valiant man , and descended from a very illustrious family ; whose grandfather had held the sovereignty of his state , and had been styled friend by our senate .
<start> Hic cum fratri intercluso ab hostibus auxilium ferret , illum ex periculo eripuit , ipse equo vulnerato deiectus , quoad potuit , fortissime restitit ; cum circumventus multis vulneribus acceptis cecidisset atque id frater , qui iam proelio excesserat , procul animadvertisset , incitato equo se hostibus obtulit atque interfectus est . <end>$$When at length he fell , surrounded on all sides and after receiving many wounds , and his brother , who had then retired from the fight , observed it from a distance , he spurred on his horse , threw himself upon the enemy , and was killed .
<start> Hoc facto proelio Caesar neque iam sibi legatos audiendos neque condiciones accipiendas arbitrabatur ab iis qui per dolum atque insidias petita pace ultro bellum intulissent ; expectare vero dum hostium copiae augerentur equitatus reverteretur summae dementiae esse iudicabat , et cognita Gallorum infirmitate quantum iam apud eos hostes uno proelio auctoritatis essent consecuti sentiebat ; quibus ad consilia capienda nihil spatii dandum existimabat . <end>$$After this engagement , Caesar considered that neither ought embassadors to be received to audience , nor conditions be accepted by him from those who , after having sued for peace by way of stratagem and treachery , had made war without provocation .
<start> His constitutis rebus et consilio cum legatis et quaestore communicato , ne quem diem pugnae praetermitteret , oportunissima res accidit , quod postridie eius diei mane eadem et perfidia et simulatione usi Germani frequentes , omnibus principibus maioribusque natu adhibitis , ad eum in castra venerunt , simul , ut dicebatur , sui purgandi causa , quod contra atque esset dictum et ipsi petissent , proelium pridie commisissent , simul ut , si quid possent , de indutiis fallendo impetrarent . <end>$$And to wait until the enemy's forces were augmented and their cavalry had returned , he concluded , would be the greatest madness ; and knowing the fickleness of the Gauls , he felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired among them by this one skirmish .
<start> Acie triplici instituta et celeriter VIII milium itinere confecto , prius ad hostium castra pervenit quam quid ageretur Germani sentire possent Qui omnibus rebus subito perterriti et celeritate adventus nostri et discessu suorum , neque consilii habendi neque arma capiendi spatio dato perturbantur , copiasne adversus hostem ducere an castra defendere an fuga salutem petere praestaret . <end>$$Having marshalled his army in three lines , and in a short time performed a march of eight miles , he arrived at the camp of the enemy before the Germans could perceive what was going on ; who being suddenly alarmed by all the circumstances , both by the speediness of our arrival and the absence of their own officers , as time was afforded neither for concerting measures nor for seizing their arms , are perplexed as to whether it would be better to lead out their forces against the enemy , or to defend their camp , or seek their safety by flight .
<start> Quorum timor cum fremitu et concursu significaretur , milites nostri pristini diei perfidia incitati in castra inruperunt Quo loco qui celeriter arma capere potuerunt paulisper nostris restiterunt atque inter carros impedimenta proelium commiserunt ; at reliqua multitudo puerorum mulierum (nam cum omnibus suis domo excesserant Rhenum transierant) passim fugere coepit , ad quos consectandos Caesar equitatum misit . <end>$$Their consternation being made apparent by their noise and tumult , our soldiers , excited by the treachery of the preceding day , rushed into the camp : such of them as could readily get their arms , for a short time withstood our men , and gave battle among their carts and baggage wagons ; but the rest of the people , of boys and women began to fly in all directions ; in pursuit of whom Caesar sent the cavalry .
<start> Germani post tergum clamore audito , eum suos interfiei viderent , armis abiectis signis militaribus relictis se ex castris eiecerunt , et eum ad confluentem Mosae et Rheni pervenissent , reliqua fuga desperata , magno numero interfecto , reliqui se in flumen praecipitaverunt atque ibi timore , lassitudine , vi fluminis oppressi perierunt . <end>$$The Germans when , upon hearing a noise behind them , saw that their families were being slain , throwing away their arms and abandoning their standards , fled out of the camp , and when they had arrived at the confluence of the Meuse and the Rhine , the survivors despairing of further escape , as a great number of their countrymen had been killed , threw themselves into the river and there perished , overcome by fear , fatigue , and the violence of the stream .
<start> Nostri ad unum omnes incolumes , perpaucis vulneratis , ex tanti belli timore , cum hostium numerus capitum CCCCXXX milium fuisset , se in castra receperunt . <end>$$Our soldiers , after the alarm of so great a war , for the number of the enemy amounted to 430 , 000 , returned to their camp , all safe to a man , very few being even wounded .
<start> Caesar iis quos in castris retinuerat discedendi potestatem fecit . <end>$$Caesar granted those whom he had detained in the camp liberty of departing .
<start> Illi supplicia cruciatusque Gallorum veriti , quorum agros vexaverant , remanere se apud eum velle dixerunt . <end>$$They however , dreading revenge and torture from the Gauls , whose lands they had harassed , said that they desired to remain with him .
<start> His Caesar libertatem concessit . <end>$$Caesar granted them permission .
<start> Germanico bello confecto multis de causis Caesar statuit sibi Rhenum esse transeundum ; quarum illa fuit iustissima quod , cum videret Germanos tam facile impelli ut in Galliam venirent , suis quoque rebus eos timere voluit , cum intellegerent et posse et audere populi Romani exercitum Rhenum transire . <end>$$The German war being finished , Caesar thought it expedient for him to cross the Rhine , for many reasons ; of which this was the most weighty , that , since he saw the Germans were so easily urged to go into Gaul , he desired they should have their fears for their own territories , when they discovered that the army of the Roman people both could and dared pass the Rhine .
<start> Accessit etiam quod illa pars equitatus Usipetum et Tencterorum , quam supra commemoravi praedandi frumentandi causa Mosam transisse neque proelio interfuisse , post fugam suorum se trans Rhenum in fines Sugambrorum receperat seque cum his coniunxerat . <end>$$There was added also , that portion of the cavalry of the Usipetes and the Tencteri , which I have above related to have crossed the Meuse for the purpose of plundering and procuring forage , and was not present at the engagement , had betaken themselves , after the retreat of their countrymen , across the Rhine into the territories of the Sugambri , and united themselves to them .
<start> Ad quos cum Caesar nuntios misisset , qui postularent eos qui sibi Galliae bellum intulissent sibi dederent , responderunt : populi Romani imperium Rhenum finire ; si se invito Germanos in Galliam transire non aequum existimaret , cur sui quicquam esse imperii aut potestatis trans Rhenum postularet ? Ubii autem , qui uni ex Transrhenanis ad Caesarem legatos miserant , amicitiam fecerant , obsides dederant , magnopere orabant ut sibi auxilium ferret , quod graviter ab Suebis premerentur ; vel , si id facere occupationibus rei publicae prohiberetur , exercitum modo Rhenum transportaret : id sibi ad auxilium spemque reliqui temporis satis futurum . <end>$$When Caesar sent embassadors to them , to demand that they should give up to him those who had made war against him and against Gaul , they replied , That the Rhine bounded the empire of the Roman people ; if he did not think it just for the Germans to pass over into Gaul against his consent , why did he claim that any thing beyond the Rhine should be subject to his dominion or power ? The Ubii , also , who alone , out of all the nations lying beyond the Rhine , had sent embassadors to Caesar , and formed an alliance and given hostages , earnestly entreated that he would bring them assistance , because they were grievously oppressed by the Suevi ; or , if he was prevented from doing so by the business of the commonwealth , he would at least transport his army over the Rhine ; that that would be sufficient for their present assistance and their hope for the future ; that so great was the name and the reputation of his army , even among the most remote nations of the Germans , arising from the defeat of Ariovistus and this last battle which was fought , that they might be safe under the fame and friendship of the Roman people .
<start> Caesar his de causis quas commemoravi Rhenum transire decrevat ; sed navibus transire neque satis tutum esse arbitrabatur neque suae neque populi Romani dignitatis esse statuebat . <end>$$Caesar , for those reasons which I have mentioned , had resolved to cross the Rhine ; but to cross by ships he neither deemed to be sufficiently safe , nor considered consistent with his own dignity or that of the Roman people .
<start> Itaque , etsi summa difficultas faciendi pontis proponebatur propter latitudinem , rapiditatem altitudinemque fluminis , tamen id sibi contendendum aut aliter non traducendum exercitum existimabat . <end>$$Therefore , although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him , on account of the breadth , rapidity , and depth of the river , he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted by him , or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over .
<start> Rationem pontis hanc instituit . <end>$$He devised this plan of a bridge .
<start> Tigna bina sesquipedalia paulum ab imo praeacuta dimensa ad altitudinem fluminis intervallo pedum duorum inter se iungebat . <end>$$He joined together at the distance of two feet , two piles , each a foot and a half thick , sharpened a little at the lower end , and proportioned in length , to the depth of the river .
<start> Haec cum machinationibus immissa in flumen defixerat fistucisque adegerat , non sublicae modo derecte ad perpendiculum , sed prone ac fastigate , ut secundum naturam fluminis procumberent , iis item contraria duo ad eundem modum iuncta intervallo pedum quadragenum ab inferiore parte contra vim atque impetu fluminis conversa statuebat . <end>$$After he had , by means of engines , sunk these into the river , and fixed them at the bottom , and then driven them in with rammers , not quite perpendicularly , dike a stake , but bending forward and sloping , so as to incline in the direction of the current of the river ; he also placed two opposite to these , at the distance of forty feet lower down , fastened together in the same manner , but directed against the force and current of the river .
<start> Haec utraque insuper bipedalibus trabibus immissis , quantum eorum tignorum iunctura distabat , binis utrimque fibulis ab extrema parte distinebantur ; quibus disclusis atque in contrariam partem revinctis , tanta erat operis firmitudo atque ea rerum natura ut , quo maior vis aquae se incitavisset , hoc artius inligata tenerentur . <end>$$Both these , moreover , were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick , laid in at their extremities between two braces on each side , and in consequence of these being in different directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other , so great was the strength of the work , and such the arrangement of the materials , that in proportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge , so much the closer were its parts held fastened together .
<start> Haec derecta materia iniecta contexebantur ac longuriis cratibusque consternebantur ; ac nihilo setius sublicae et ad inferiorem partem fluminis oblique agebantur , quae pro ariete subiectae et cum omni opere coniunctae vim fluminis exciperent , et aliae item supra pontem mediocri spatio , ut , si arborum trunci sive naves deiciendi operis causa essent a barbaris missae , his defensoribus earum rerum vis minueretur neu ponti nocerent . <end>$$These beams were bound together by timber laid over them , in the direction of the length of the bridge , and were covered over with laths and hurdles ; and in addition to this , piles were driven into the water obliquely , at the lower side of the bridge , and these , serving as buttresses , and being connected with every portion of the work , sustained the force of the stream : and there were others also above the bridge , at a moderate distance ; that if trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the river by the barbarians for the purpose of destroying the work , the violence of such things might be diminished by these defenses , and might not injure the bridge .
<start> Diebus X , quibus materia coepta erat comportari , omni opere effecto exercitus traducitur . <end>$$Within ten days after the timber began to be collected , the whole work was completed , and the whole army led over .
<start> Caesar ad utramque partem pontis firmo praesidio relicto in fines Sugambrorum contendit . <end>$$Caesar , leaving a strong guard at each end of the bridge , hastens into the territories of the Sugambri .
<start> Interim a compluribus civitatibus ad eum legati veniunt ; quibus pacem atque amicitiam petentibus liberaliter respondet obsidesque ad se adduci iubet . <end>$$In the mean time , embassadors from several nations come to him , whom , on their suing for peace and alliance , he answers in a courteous manner , and orders hostages to be brought to him .
<start> At Sugambri , ex eo tempore quo pons institui coeptus est fuga comparata , hortantibus iis quos ex Tencteris atque Usipetibus apud se habebant , finibus suis excesserant suaque omnia exportaverant seque in solitudinem ac silvas abdiderant . <end>$$But the Sugambri , at the very time the bridge was begun to be built , made preparations for a flight , and quitted their territories , and conveyed away all their possessions , and concealed themselves in deserts and woods .
<start> Caesar paucos dies in eorum finibus moratus , omnibus vicis aedificiisque incensis frumentisque succisis , se in fines Ubiorum recepit atque his auxilium suum pollicitus , si a Suebis premerentur , haec ab iis cognovit : Suebos , postea quam per exploratores pontem fieri comperissent , more suo concilio habito nuntios in omnes partes dimisisse , uti de oppidis demigrarent , liberos , uxores suaque omnia in silvis deponerent atque omnes qui arma ferre possent unum in locum convenirent . <end>$$Caesar , having remained in their territories a few days , and burned all their villages and houses , and cut down their corn , proceeded into the territories of the Ubii ; and having promised them his assistance , if they were ever harassed by the Suevi , he learned from them these particulars : that the Suevi , after they had by means of their scouts found that the bridge was being built , had called a council , according to their custom , and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the towns and convey their children , wives , and all their possessions into the woods , and that all who could bear arms should assemble in one place ; that the place thus chosen was nearly the centre of those regions which the Suevi possessed ; that in this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of the Romans , and give them battle there .
<start> Hunc esse delectum medium fere regionum earum quas Suebi obtinerent ; hic Romanorum adventum expectare atque ibi decertare constituisse Quod ubi Caesar comperit , omnibus iis rebus confectis , quarum rerum causa exercitum traducere constituerat , ut Germanis metum iniceret , ut Sugambros ulcisceretur , ut Ubios obsidione liberaret , diebus omnino XVIII trans Rhenum consumptis , satis et ad laudem et ad utilitatem profectum arbitratus se in Galliam recepit pontemque rescidit . <end>$$When Caesar discovered this , having already accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved to lead his army over , namely , to strike fear into the Germans , take vengeance on the Sugambri , and free the Ubii from the invasion of the Suevi , having spent altogether eighteen days beyond the Rhine , and thinking he had advanced far enough to serve both honor and interest , he returned into Gaul , and cut down the bridge .
<start> Exigua parte aestatis reliqua Caesar , etsi in his locis , quod omnis Gallia ad septentriones vergit , maturae sunt hiemes , tamen in Britanniam proficisci contendit , quod omnibus fere Gallicis bellis hostibus nostris inde subministrata auxilia intellegebat , et si tempus anni ad bellum gerendum deficeret , tamen magno sibi usui fore arbitrabatur , si modo insulam adiisset , genus hominum perspexisset , loca , portus , aditus cognovisset ; quae omnia fere Gallis erant incognita . <end>$$During the short part of summer which remained , Caesar , although in these countries , as all Gaul lies toward the north , the winters are early , nevertheless resolved to proceed into Britain , because he discovered that in almost all the wars with the Gauls succors had been furnished to our enemy from that country ; and even if the time of year should be insufficient for carrying on the war , yet he thought it would be of great service to him if he only entered the island , and saw into the character of the people , and got knowledge of their localities , harbors , and landing-places , all which were for the most part unknown to the Gauls .
<start> Neque enim temere praeter mercatores illo adit quisquam , neque his ipsis quicquam praeter oram maritimam atque eas regiones quae sunt contra Galliam notum est . <end>$$For neither does any one except merchants generally go thither , nor even to them was any portion of it known , except the sea-coast and those parts which are opposite to Gaul .
<start> Itaque vocatis ad se undique mercatoribus , neque quanta esset insulae magnitudo neque quae aut quantae nationes incolerent , neque quem usum belli haberent aut quibus institutis uterentur , neque qui essent ad maiorem navium multitudinem idonei portus reperire poterat . <end>$$Therefore , after having called up to him the merchants from all parts , he could learn neither what was the size of the island , nor what or how numerous were the nations which inhabited it , nor what system of war they followed , nor what customs they used , nor what harbors were convenient for a great number of large ships .
<start> Ad haec cognoscenda , prius quam periculum faceret , idoneum esse arbitratus Gaius Volusenum cum navi longa praemittit . <end>$$He sends before him Gaius Volusenus with a ship of war , to acquire a knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a descent into the island , as he was convinced that this was a judicious measure .
<start> Huic mandat ut exploratis omnibus rebus ad se quam primum revertatur . <end>$$He commissioned him to thoroughly examine into all matters , and then return to him as soon as possible .
<start> Ipse cum omnibus copiis in Morinos proficiscitur , quod inde erat brevissimus in Britanniam traiectus . <end>$$He himself proceeds to the Morini with all his forces .
<start> Huc naves undique ex finitimis regionibus et quam superiore aestate ad Veneticum bellum fecerat classem iubet convenire . <end>$$He orders ships from all parts of the neighboring countries , and the fleet which the preceding summer he had built for the war with the Veneti , to assemble in this place .
<start> Interim , consilio eius cognito et per mercatores perlato ad Britannos , a compluribus insulae civitatibus ad eum legati veniunt , qui polliceantur obsides dare atque imperio populi Romani obtemperare . <end>$$In the mean time , his purpose having been discovered , and reported to the Britons by merchants , embassadors come to him from several states of the island , to promise that they will give hostages , and submit to the government of the Roman people .
<start> Quibus auditis , liberaliter pollicitus hortatusque ut in ea sententia permanerent , eos domum remittit et cum iis una Commium , quem ipse Atrebatibus superatis regem ibi constituerat , cuius et virtutem et consilium probabat et quem sibi fidelem esse arbitrabatur cuiusque auctoritas in his regionibus magni habebatur , mittit . <end>$$Having given them an audience , he after promising liberally , and exhorting them to continue in that purpose , sends them back to their own country , and with them Commius , whom , upon subduing the Atrebates , he had created king there , a man whose courage and conduct he esteemed , and who he thought would be faithful to him , and whose influence ranked highly in those countries .
<start> Huic imperat quas possit adeat civitates horteturque ut populi Romani fidem sequantur seque celeriter eo venturum nuntiet . <end>$$He orders him to visit as many states as he could , and persuade them to embrace the protection of the Roman people , and apprize them that he would shortly come thither .
<start> Volusenus perspectis regionibus omnibus quantum ei facultatis dari potuit , qui navi egredi ac se barbaris committere non auderet , V die ad Caesarem revertitur quaeque ibi perspexisset renuntiat . <end>$$Volusenus , having viewed the localities as far as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship and trust himself to barbarians , returns to Caesar on the fifth day , and reports what he had there observed .
<start> Dum in his locis Caesar navium parandarum causa moratur , ex magna parte Morinorum ad eum legati venerunt , qui se de superioris temporis consilio excusarent , quod homines barbari et nostrae consuetudinis imperiti bellum populo Romano fecissent , seque ea quae imperasset facturos pollicerentur . <end>$$While Caesar remains in these parts for the purpose of procuring ships , embassadors come to him from a great portion of the Morini , to plead their excuse respecting their conduct on the late occasion ; alleging that it was as men uncivilized , and as those who were unacquainted with our custom , that they had made war upon the Roman people , and promising to perform what he should command .
<start> Hoc sibi Caesar satis oportune accidisse arbitratus , quod neque post tergum hostem relinquere volebat neque belli gerendi propter anni tempus facultatem habebat neque has tantularum rerum occupationes Britanniae anteponendas iudicabat , magnum iis numerum obsidum imperat . <end>$$Caesar , thinking that this had happened fortunately enough for him , because he neither wished to leave an enemy behind him , nor had an opportunity for carrying on a war , by reason of the time of year , nor considered that employment in such trifling matters was to be preferred to his enterprise on Britain , imposes a large number of hostages ; and when these were brought , he received them to his protection .
<start> Quibus adductis eos in fidem recipit Navibus circiter LXXX onerariis coactis contractisque , quot satis esse ad duas transportandas legiones existimabat , quod praeterea navium longarum habebat quaestori , legatis praefectisque distribuit . <end>$$Having collected together , and provided about eighty transport ships , as many as he thought necessary for conveying over two legions , he assigned such of war as he had besides to the quaestor , his legates , and officers of cavalry .
<start> Huc accedebant XVIII onerariae naves , quae ex eo loco a milibus passuum VIII vento tenebantur quo minus in eundem portum venire possent : has equitibus tribuit . <end>$$There were in addition to these eighteen ships of burden which were prevented , eight miles from that place , by winds , from being able to reach the same port .
<start> Reliquum exercitum Quintus Titurio Sabino et Lucius Aurunculeio Cottae legatis in Menapios atque in eos pagos Morinorum a quibus ad eum legati non venerant ducendum dedit . <end>$$These he distributed among the horse ; the rest of the army , he delivered to Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta , his legates , to lead into the territories of the Menapii and those cantons of the Morini from which embassadors had not come to him .
<start> Publius Sulpicium Rufum legatum cum eo praesidio quod satis esse arbitrabatur portum tenere iussit . <end>$$He ordered Publius Sulpicius Rufus , his legate , to hold possession of the harbor , with such a garrison as he thought sufficient .
<start> His constitutis rebus , nactus idoneam ad navigandum tempestatem III fere vigilia solvit equitesque in ulteriorem portum progredi et naves conscendere et se sequi iussit . <end>$$These matters being arranged , finding the weather favorable for his voyage , he set sail about the third watch , and ordered the horse to march forward to the further port , and there embark and follow him .
<start> A quibus cum paulo tardius esset administratum , ipse hora diei circiter IIII cum primis navibus Britanniam attigit atque ibi in omnibus collibus expositas hostium copias armatas conspexit . <end>$$As this was performed rather tardily by them , he himself reached Britain with the first squadron of ships , about the fourth hour of the day , and there saw the forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills .
<start> Cuius loci haec erat natura atque ita montibus angustis mare continebatur , uti ex locis superioribus in litus telum adigi posset . <end>$$The nature of the place was this : the sea was confined by mountains so close to it that a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore .
<start> Hunc ad egrediendum nequaquam idoneum locum arbitratus , dum reliquae naves eo convenirent ad horam nonam in ancoris expectavit . <end>$$Considering this by no means a fit place for disembarking , he remained at anchor till the ninth hour , for the other ships to arrive there .
<start> Interim legatis tribunisque militum convocatis et quae ex Voluseno cognovisset et quae fieri vellet ostendit monuitque , ut rei militaris ratio , maximeque ut maritimae res postularent , ut , cum celerem atque instabilem motum haberent , ad nutum et ad tempus D omnes res ab iis administrarentur . <end>$$Having in the mean time assembled the legates and military tribunes , he told them both what he had learned from Volusenus , and what he wished to be done ; and enjoined them that all things should be performed by them at a nod and at the instant .
<start> At barbari , consilio Romanorum cognito praemisso equitatu et essedariis , quo plerumque genere in proeliis uti consuerunt , reliquis copiis subsecuti nostros navibus egredi prohibebant . <end>$$But the barbarians , upon perceiving the design of the Romans , sent forward their cavalry and charioteers , a class of warriors of whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles , and following with the rest of their forces , endeavored to prevent our men landing .
<start> Erat ob has causas summa difficultas , quod naves propter magnitudinem nisi in alto constitui non poterant , militibus autem , ignotis locis , impeditis manibus , magno et gravi onere armorum oppressis simul et de navibus desiliendum et in auctibus consistendum et cum hostibus erat pugnandum , cum illi aut ex arido aut paulum in aquam progressi omnibus membris expeditis , notissimis locis , audacter tela coicerent et equos insuefactos incitarent . <end>$$In this was the greatest difficulty , for the following reasons , namely , because our ships , on account of their great size , could be stationed only in deep water ; and our soldiers , in places unknown to them , with their hands embarrassed , oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor , had at the same time to leap from the ships , stand amid the waves , and encounter the enemy ; whereas they , either on dry ground , or advancing a little way into the water , free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known to them , could confidently throw their weapons and spur on their horses , which were accustomed to this kind of service .
<start> Quibus rebus nostri perterriti atque huius omnino generis pugnae imperiti , non eadem alacritate ac studio quo in pedestribus uti proeliis consuerant utebantur . <end>$$Dismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode of battle , our men did not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which they had been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground .
<start> Quod ubi Caesar animadvertit , naves longas , quarum et species erat barbaris inusitatior et motus ad usum expeditior , paulum removeri ab onerariis navibus et remis incitari et ad latus apertum hostium constitui atque inde fundis , sagittis , tormentis hostes propelli ac submoveri iussit ; quae res magno usui nostris fuit . <end>$$When Caesar observed this , he ordered the ships of war , the appearance of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the motion more ready for service , to be withdrawn a little from the transport vessels , and to be propelled by their oars , and be stationed toward the open flank of the enemy , and the enemy to be beaten off and driven away , with slings , arrows , and engines : which plan was of great service to our men ; for the barbarians being startled by the form of our ships and the motions of our oars and the nature of our engines , which was strange to them , stopped , and shortly after retreated a little .
<start> ' Hoc cum voce magna dixisset , se ex navi proiecit atque in hostes aquilam ferre coepit . <end>$$When he had said this with a loud voice , he leaped from the ship and proceeded to bear the eagle toward the enemy .
<start> Tum nostri cohortati inter se , ne tantum dedecus admitteretur , universi ex navi desiluerunt . <end>$$Then our men , exhorting one another that so great a disgrace should not be incurred , all leaped from the ship .
<start> Hos item ex proximis primi navibus cum conspexissent , subsecuti hostibus adpropinquaverunt . <end>$$When those in the nearest vessels saw them , they speedily followed and approached the enemy .
<start> Pugnatum est ab utrisque acriter . <end>$$The battle was maintained vigorously on both sides .
<start> Nostri tamen , quod neque ordines servare neque firmiter insistere neque signa subsequi poterant atque alius alia ex navi quibuscumque signis occurrerat se adgregabat , magnopere perturbabantur ; hostes vero , notis omnibus vadii , ubi ex litore aliquos singulares ex navi egredientes conspexerant , incitatis equis impeditos adoriebantur , plures paucos circumsistebant , alii ab latere aperto in universos tela coiciebant . <end>$$Our men , however , as they could neither keep their ranks , nor get firm footing , nor follow their standards , and as one from one ship and another from another assembled around whatever standards they met , were thrown into great confusion .
<start> Quod cum animadvertisset Caesar , scaphas longarum navium , item speculatoria navigia militibus compleri iussit , et quos laborantes conspexerat , his subsidia submittebat . <end>$$But the enemy , who were acquainted with all the shallows , when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by one , spurred on their horses , and attacked them while embarrassed ; many surrounded a few , others threw their weapons upon our collected forces on their exposed flank .
<start> Nostri , simul in arido constiterunt , suis omnibus consecutis , in hostes impetum fecerunt atque eos in fugam dederunt ; neque longius prosequi potuerunt , quod equites cursum tenere atque insulam capere non potuerant . <end>$$When Caesar observed this , he ordered the boats of the ships of war and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers , and sent them up to the succor of those whom he had observed in distress .
<start> Hostes proelio superati , simul atque se ex fuga : receperunt , statim ad Caesarem legatos de pace miserunt ; obsides sese daturos quaeque imperasset facturos polliciti sunt . <end>$$The enemy being thus vanquished in battle , as soon as they recovered after their flight , instantly sent embassadors to Caesar to negotiate about peace .
<start> Una cum his legatis Commius Atrebas venit , quem supra demonstraveram a Caesare in Britanniam praemissum . <end>$$They promised to give hostages and perform what he should command .
<start> Hunc illi e navi egressum , cum ad eos oratoris modo Caesaris mandata deferret , comprehenderant atque in vincula coniecerant ; tum proelio facto remiserunt et in petenda pace eius rei culpam in multitudinem contulerunt et propter imprudentiam ut ignosceretur petiverunt . <end>$$Together with these embassadors came Commius the Atrebatian , who , as I have above said , had been sent by Caesar into Britain Him they had seized upon when leaving his ship , although in the character of embassador he bore the general's commission to them , and thrown into chains : then after the battle was fought , they sent him back , and in suing for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common people , and entreated that it might be pardoned on account of their indiscretion .
<start> Caesar questus quod , cum ultro in continentem legatis missis pacem ab se petissent , bellum sine causa intulissent , ignoscere se imprudentiae dixit obsidesque imperavit ; quorum illi partem statim dederunt , partem ex longinquioribus locis arcessitam paucis diebus sese daturos dixerunt . <end>$$Caesar , complaining , that after they had sued for peace , and had voluntarily sent embassadors into the continent for that purpose , they had made war without a reason , said that he would pardon their indiscretion , and imposed hostages , a part of whom they gave immediately ; the rest they said they would give in a few days , since they were sent for from remote places .
<start> Interea suos in agros remigrare iusserunt , principesque undique convenire et se civitatesque suas Caesari commendare coeperunt . <end>$$In the mean time they ordered their people to return to the country parts , and the chiefs assembled from all quarter , and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to Caesar .
<start> His rebus pace confirmata , post diem quartum quam est in Britanniam ventum naves XVIII , de quibus supra demonstratum est , quae equites sustulerant , ex superiore portu leni vento solverunt Quae cum adpropinquarent Britanniae et ex castris viderentur , tanta tempestas subito coorta est ut nulla earum cursum tenere posset , sed aliae eodem unde erant profectae referrentur , aliae ad inferiorem partem insulae , quae est propius solis occasum , magno suo cum periculo deicerentur ; quae tamen ancoris iactis cum fluctibus complerentur , necessario adversa nocte in altum provectae continentem petierunt . <end>$$A peace being established by these proceedings four days after we had come into Britain , the eighteen ships , to which reference has been made above , and which conveyed the cavalry , set sail from the upper port with a gentle gale , when , however , they were approaching Britain and were seen from the camp , so great a storm suddenly arose that none of them could maintain their course at sea ; and some were taken back to the same port from which they had started ; -others , to their great danger , were driven to the lower part of the island , nearer to the west ; which , however , after having cast anchor , as they were getting filled with water , put out to sea through necessity in a stormy night , and made for the continent .
<start> Eadem nocte accidit ut esset luna plena , qui dies maritimos aestus maximos in Oceano efficere consuevit , nostrisque id erat incognitum . <end>$$It happened that night to be full moon , which usually occasions very high tides in that ocean ; and that circumstance was unknown to our men .
<start> Ita uno tempore et longas naves , quas Caesar in aridum subduxerat , aestus complebat , et onerarias , quae ad ancoras erant deligatae , tempestas adflictabat , neque ulla nostris facultas aut administrandi , aut auxiliandi dabatur . <end>$$Thus , at the same time , the tide began to fill the ships of war which Caesar had provided to convey over his army , and which he had drawn up on the strand ; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden which were riding at anchor against each other ; nor was any means afforded our men of either managing them or of rendering any service .
<start> Compluribus navibus fractis , reliquae cum essent funibus , ancoris reliquisque armamentis amissis ad navigandum inutiles , magna , id quod necesse erat accidere , totius exercitus perturbatio facta est Neque enim naves erant aliae quibus reportari possent , et omnia deerant quae ad reficiendas naves erant usui , et , quod omnibus constabat hiemari in Gallia oportere , frumentum in his locis in hiemem provisum non erat . <end>$$A great many ships having been wrecked , inasmuch as the rest , having lost their cables , anchors , and other tackling , were unfit for sailing , a great confusion , as would necessarily happen , arose throughout the army ; for there were no other ships in which they could be conveyed back , and all things which are of service in repairing vessels were wanting , and , corn for the winter had not been provided in those places , because it was understood by all that they would certainly winter in Gaul .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis , principes Britanniae , qui post proelium ad Caesarem convenerant , inter se conlocuti , cum et equites et naves et frumentum Romanis deesse intellegerent et paucitatem militum ex castrorum exiguitate cognoscerent , quae hoc erant etiam angustior quod sine impedimentis Caesar legiones transportaverat , optimum factu esse duxerunt rebellione facta frumento commeatuque nostros prohibere et rem in hiemem producere , quod his superatis aut reditu interclusis neminem postea belli inferendi causa in Britanniam transiturum confidebant . <end>$$On discovering these things the chiefs of Britain , who had come up after the battle was fought to perform those conditions which Caesar had imposed , held a conference , when they perceived that cavalry , and ships , and corn were wanting to the Romans , and discovered the small number of our soldiers from the small extent of the camp , and thought that the best plan was to renew the war , and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract the affair till winter ; because they felt confident , that , if they were vanquished or cut off from a return , no one would afterward pass over into Britain for the purpose of making war .
<start> Itaque rursus coniuratione facta paulatim ex castris discedere et suos clam ex agris deducere coeperunt . <end>$$Therefore , again entering into a conspiracy , they began to depart from the camp by degrees and secretly bring up their people from the country parts .
<start> At Caesar , etsi nondum eorum consilia cognoverat , tamen et ex eventu navium suarum et ex eo quod obsides dare intermiserant fore id quod accidit suspicabatur . <end>$$But Caesar , although he had not as yet discovered their measures , yet , both from what had occurred to his ships , and from the circumstance that they had neglected to give the promised hostages , suspected that the thing would come to pass which really did happen .
<start> Itaque ad omnes casus subsidia comparabat Nam et frumentum ex agris cotidie in castra conferebat et , quae gravissime adflictae erant naves , earum materia atque aere ad reliquas reficiendas utebatur et quae ad eas res erant usui ex continenti comportari iubebat . <end>$$He therefore provided remedies against all contingencies ; for he daily conveyed corn from the country parts into the camp , used the timber and brass of such ships as were most seriously damaged for repairing the rest , and ordered whatever things besides were necessary for this object to be brought to him from the continent .
<start> Itaque , cum summo studio a militibus administraretur , XII navibus amissis , reliquis ut navigari satis commode posset effecit . <end>$$And thus , since that business was executed by the soldiers with the greatest energy , he effected that , after the loss of twelve ships , a voyage could be made well enough in the rest .
<start> , neque ulla ad id tempus belli suspicione interposita , cum pars hominum in agris remaneret , pars etiam in castra ventitaret , ii qui pro portis castrorum in statione erant Caesari nuntiaverunt pulverem maiorem quam consuetudo ferret in ea parte videri quam in partem legio iter fecisset . <end>$$Caesar , suspecting that which was , —that some new enterprise was undertaken by the barbarians , ordered the two cohorts which were on duty , to march into that quarter with him , and two other cohorts to relieve them on duty ; the rest to be armed and follow him immediately .
<start> Caesar---id quod erat---suspicatus aliquid novi a barbaris initum consilii , cohortes quae in statione erant secum in eam partem proficisci , ex reliquis duas in stationem succedere , reliquas armari et confestim sese subsequi iussit . <end>$$When he had advanced some little way from the camp , he saw that his men were overpowered by the enemy and scarcely able to stand their ground , and that , the legion being crowded together , weapons were being cast on them from all sides .
<start> Cum paulo longius a castris processisset , suos ab hostibus premi atque aegre sustinere et conferta legione ex omnibus partibus tela coici animadvertit . <end>$$For as all the corn was reaped in every part with the exception of one , the enemy , suspecting that our men would repair to that , had concealed themselves in the woods during the night .
<start> Nam quod omni ex reliquis partibus demesso frumento pars una erat reliqua , suspicati hostes huc nostros esse venturos noctu in silvis delituerant ; tum dispersos depositis armis in metendo occupatos Subito adorti paucis interfectis reliquos incertis ordinibus perturbaverant , simul equitatu atque essedis circumdederant . <end>$$Then attacking them suddenly , scattered as they were , and when they had laid aside their arms , and were engaged in reaping , they killed a small number , threw the rest into confusion , and surrounded them with their cavalry and chariots .
<start> Genus hoc est ex essedis pugnae Primo per omnes partes perequitant et tela coiciunt atque ipso terrore equorum et strepitu rotarum ordines plerumque perturbant , et cum se inter equitum turmas insinuaverunt , ex essedis desiliunt et pedibus proeliantur . <end>$$Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this : firstly , they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels ; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse , leap from their chariots and engage on foot .
<start> Aurigae interim paulatim ex proelio excedunt atque ita currus conlocant ut , si illi a multitudine hostium premantur , expeditum ad quos receptum habeant . <end>$$The charioteers in the mean time withdraw some little distance from the battle , and so place themselves with the chariots that , if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy , they may have a ready retreat to their own troops .
<start> Ita mobilitatem equitum , stabilitatem peditum in proeliis praestant , ac tantum usu cotidiano et exercitatione efficiunt uti in declivi ac praecipiti loco incitatos equos sustinere et brevi moderari ac flectere et per temonem percurrere et in iugo insistere et se inde in currus citissime recipere consuerint . <end>$$Thus they display in battle the speed of horse , the firmness of infantry ; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed , even on a declining and steep place , to check their horses at full speed , and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole , and stand on the yoke , and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again .
<start> Quibus rebus perturbatis nostris tempore oportunissimo Caesar auxilium tulit : namque eius adventu hostes constiterunt , nostri se ex timore receperunt Quo facto , ad lacessendum hostem et committendum proelium alienum esse tempus arbitratus suo se loco continuit et brevi tempore intermisso in castra legiones reduxit . <end>$$Under these circumstances , our men being dismayed by the novelty of this mode of battle , Caesar most seasonably brought assistance ; for upon his arrival the enemy paused , and our men recovered from their fear ; upon which thinking the time unfavorable for provoking the enemy and coming to an action , he kept himself in his own quarter , and , a short time having intervened , drew back the legions into the camp .
<start> Dum haec geruntur , nostris omnibus occupatis qui erant in agris reliqui discesserunt . <end>$$While these things are going on , and all our men engaged , the rest of the Britons , who were in the fields , departed .
<start> Secutae sunt continuos complures dies tempeststes , quae et nostros in castris continerent et hostem a pugna prohiberent . <end>$$Storms then set in for several successive days , which both confined our men to the camp and hindered the enemy from attacking us .
<start> Interim barbari nuntios in omnes partes dimiserunt paucitatemque nostrorum militum suis praedicaverunt et quanta praedae faciendae atque in perpetuum sui liberandi facultas daretur , si Romanos castris expulissent , demonstra ; verunt . <end>$$In the mean time the barbarians dispatched messengers to all parts , and reported to their people the small number of our soldiers , and how good an opportunity was given for obtaining spoil and for liberating themselves forever , if they should only drive the Romans from their camp .
<start> His rebus celeriter magna multitudine peditatus equitatusque coacta ad castra venerunt . <end>$$Having by these means speedily got together a large force of infantry and of cavalry they came up to the camp .
<start> Caesar , etsi idem quod superioribus diebus acciderat fore videbat , ut , si essent hostes pulsi , celeritate periculum effugerent , tamen nactus equites circiter XXX , quos Commius Atrebas , de quo ante dictum est , secum transportaverat , legiones in acie pro castris constituit . <end>$$Although Caesar anticipated that the same thing which had happened on former occasions would then occur-that , if the enemy were routed , they would escape from danger by their speed ; still , having got about thirty horse , which Commius the Atrebatian , of whom mention has been made , had brought over with him , he drew up the legions in order of battle before the camp .
<start> Commisso proelio diutius nostrorum militum impetum hostes ferre non potuerunt ac terga verterunt Quos tanto spatio secuti quantum cursu et viribus efficere potuerunt , complures ex iis occiderunt , deinde omnibus longe lateque aedificiis incensis se in castra receperunt . <end>$$When the action commenced , the enemy were unable to sustain the attack of our men long , and turned their backs ; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength permitted , and slew a great number of them ; then , having destroyed and burned every thing far and wide , they retreated to their camp .
<start> Eodem die legati ab hostibus missi ad Caesarem de pace venerunt . <end>$$The same day , embassadors sent by the enemy came to Caesar to negotiate a peace .
<start> His Caesar numerum obsidum quem ante imperaverat duplicavit eosque in continentem adduci iussit , quod propinqua die aequinoctii infirmis navibus hiemi navigationem subiciendam non existimabat . <end>$$Caesar doubled the number of hostages which he had before demanded ; and ordered that they should be brought over to the continent , because , since the time of the equinox was near , he did not consider that , with his ships out of repair , the voyage ought to be deferred till winter .
<start> Ipse idoneam tempestatem nactus paulo post mediam noctem naves solvit , quae omnes incolumes ad continentem pervenerunt ; sed ex iis onerariae duae eosdem portus quos reliquae capere non potuerunt et paulo infra delatae sunt . <end>$$Having met with favorable weather , he set sail a little after midnight , and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent , except two of the ships of burden which could not make the same port which the other ships did , and were carried a little lower down .
<start> Quibus ex navibus cum essent expositi milites circiter CCC atque in castra contenderent , Morini , quos Caesar in Britanniam proficiscens pacatos reliquerat , spe praedae adducti primo non ita magno suorum numero circumsteterunt ac , si sese interfici nollent , arma ponere iusserunt Cum illi orbe facto sese defenderent , celeriter ad clamorem hominum circiter milia VI convenerunt ; Qua re nuntiata , Caesar omnem ex castris equitatum suis auxilio misit . <end>$$When our soldiers , about 300 in number , had been drawn out of these two ships , and were marching to the camp , the Morini , whom Caesar , when setting forth for Britain , had left in a state of peace , excited by the hope of spoil , at first surrounded them with a small number of men , and ordered them to lay down their arms , if they did not wish to be slain ; afterward however , when they , forming a circle , stood on their defense , a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled ; which being reported , Caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as a relief to his men .
<start> Interim nostri milites impetum hostium sustinuerunt atque amplius horis IIII fortissime pugnaverunt et paucis vulneribus acceptis complures ex iis occiderunt . <end>$$In the mean time our soldiers sustained the attack of the enemy , and fought most valiantly for more than four hours , and , receiving but few wounds themselves , slew several of them .
<start> Postea vero quam equitatus noster in conspectum venit , hostes abiectis armis terga verterunt magnusque eorum numerus est occisus . <end>$$But after our cavalry came in sight , the enemy , throwing away their arms , turned their backs , and a great number of them were killed .
<start> Caesar postero die Titus Labienum legatum cum iis legionibus quas ex Britannia reduxerat in Morinos qui rebellionem fecerant misit Qui cum propter siccitates paludum quo se reciperent non haberent , quo perfugio superiore anno erant usi , omnes fere in potestatem Labieni venerunt . <end>$$The day following Caesar sent Labienus , his legate , with those legions which he had brought back from Britain , against the Morini , who had revolted ; who , as they had no place to which they might retreat , on account of the drying up of their marshes , almost all fell into the power of Labienus .
<start> At Quintus Titurius et Lucius Cotta legati , qui in Menapiorum fines legiones duxerant , omnibus eorum agris vastatis , frumentis succisis , aedificiis incensis , quod Menapii se omnes in densissimas silvas abdiderant , se ad Caesarem receperunt . <end>$$In the mean time Caesar's legates , Quintus Titurius and Lucius Cotta , who had led the legions into the territories of the Menapii , having laid waste all their lands , cut down their corn and burned their houses , returned to Caesar because the Menapii had all concealed themselves in their thickest woods .
<start> Caesar in Belgis omnium legionum hiberna constituit . <end>$$Caesar fixed the winter quarters of all the legions among the Belgae .
<start> Eo duae omnino civitates ex Britannia obsides miserunt , reliquae neglexerunt . <end>$$Thither only two British states sent hostages ; the rest omitted to do so .
<start> His rebus gestis ex litteris Caesaris dierum XX supplicatio a senatu decreta est . <end>$$For these successes , a thanksgiving of twenty days was decreed by the senate upon receiving Caesar's letter .
<start> L Domitio Ap Claudio consulibus , discedens ab hibernis Caesar in Italiam , ut quotannis facere consuerat , legatis imperat quos legionibus praefecerat uti quam plurimas possent hieme naves aedificandas veteresque reficiendas curarent . <end>$$While Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius were consuls , Caesar , when departing from his winter quarters into Italy , as he had been accustomed to do yearly , commands the legates whom he appointed over the legions to take care that during the winter as many ships as possible should be built , and the old repaired .
<start> Earum modum formamque demonstrat . <end>$$He plans the size and shape of them .
<start> Ad celeritatem onerandi subductionesque paulo facit humiliores quam quibus in nostro mari uti consuevimus , atque id eo magis , quod propter crebras commutationes aestuum minus magnos ibi fluctus fieri cognoverat ; ad onera , ad multitudinem iumentorum transportandam paulo latiores quam quibus in reliquis utimur maribus . <end>$$For dispatch of lading , and for drawing them on shore , he makes them a little lower than those which we have been accustomed to use in our sea ; and that so much the more , because he knew that , on account of the frequent changes of the tide , less swells occurred there ; for the purpose of transporting burdens and a great number of horses , a little broader than those which we use in other seas .
<start> Has omnes actuarias imperat fieri , quam ad rem multum humilitas adiuvat . <end>$$All these he orders to be constructed for lightness and expedition , to which object their lowness contributes greatly .
<start> Ea quae sunt usui ad armandas naves ex Hispania apportari iubet . <end>$$He orders those things which are necessary for equipping ships to be brought thither from Spain .
<start> Ipse conventibus Galliae citerioris peractis in Illyricum proficiscitur , quod a Pirustis finitimam partem provinciae incursionibus vastari audiebat . <end>$$He himself , on the assizes of Hither Gaul being concluded , proceeds into Illyricum , because he heard that the part of the province nearest them was being laid waste by the incursions of the Pirustae .
<start> Eo cum venisset , civitatibus milites imperat certumque in locum convenire iubet . <end>$$When he had arrived there , he levies soldiers upon the states , and orders them to assemble at an appointed place .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Pirustae legatos ad eum mittunt qui doceant nihil earum rerum publico factum consilio , seseque paratos esse demonstrant omnibus rationibus de iniuriis satisfacere . <end>$$Which circumstance having been reported , the Pirustae send embassadors to him to inform him that no part of those proceedings was done by public deliberation , and assert that they were ready to make compensation by all means for the injuries  .
<start> Accepta oratione eorum Caesar obsides imperat eosque ad certam diem adduci iubet ; nisi ita fecerint , sese bello civitatem persecuturum demonstrat . <end>$$Caesar , accepting their defense , demands hostages , and orders them to be brought to him on a specified day , and assures them that unless they did so he would visit their state with war .
<start> Eis ad diem adductis , ut imperaverat , arbitros inter civitates dat qui litem aestiment poenamque constituant . <end>$$These being brought to him on the day which he had ordered , he appoints arbitrators between the states , who should estimate the damages and determine the reparation .
<start> His confectis rebus conventibusque peractis , in citeriorem Galliam revertitur atque inde ad exercitum proficiscitur . <end>$$These things being finished , and the assizes being concluded , he returns into Hither Gaul , and proceeds thence to the army .
<start> Eo cum venisset , circuitis omnibus hibernis , singulari militum studio in summa omnium rerum inopia circiter sescentas eius generis cuius supra demonstravimus naves et longas XXVIII invenit instructas neque multum abesse ab eo quin paucis diebus deduci possint . <end>$$When he had arrived there , having made a survey of the winter quarter , he finds that , by the extraordinary ardor of the soldiers , amid the utmost scarcity of all materials , about six hundred ships of that kind which we have described above and twenty-eight ships of war , had been built , and were not far from that state , that they might be launched in a few days .
<start> Collaudatis militibus atque eis qui negotio praefuerant , quid fieri velit ostendit atque omnes ad portum Itium convenire iubet , quo ex portu commodissimum in Britanniam traiectum esse cognoverat , circiter milium passuum XXX transmissum a continenti : huic rei quod satis esse visum est militum reliquit . <end>$$Having commended the soldiers and those who had presided over the work , he informs them what he wishes to be done , and orders all the ships to assemble at port Itius , from which port he had learned that the passage into Britain was shortest , about thirty miles from the continent .
<start> Ipse cum legionibus expeditis IIII et equitibus DCCC in fines Treverorum proficiscitur , quod hi neque ad concilia veniebant neque imperio parebant Germanosque Transrhenanos sollicitare dicebantur . <end>$$He left what seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that design ; he himself proceeds into the territories of the Treveri with four legions without baggage , and 800 horse , because they neither came to the general diets , nor obeyed his commands , and were moreover , said to be tampering with the Germans beyond the Rhine .
<start> Haec civitas longe plurimum totius Galliae equitatu valet magnasque habet copias peditum Rhenumque , ut supra demonstravimus , tangit . <end>$$This state is by far the most powerful of all Gaul in cavalry , and has great forces of infantry , and as we have remarked above , borders on the Rhine .
<start> In ea civitate duo de principatu inter se contendebant , Indutiomarus et Cingetorix ; e quibus alter , simul atque de Caesaris legionumque adventu cognitum est , ad eum venit , se suosque omnes in offlcio futuros neque ab amicitia populi Romani defecturos confirmavit quaeque in Treveris gererentur ostendit . <end>$$But Indutiomarus began to collect cavalry and infantry , and make preparations for war , having concealed those who by reason of their age could not be under arms , in the forest Arduenna , which is of immense size , extends from the Rhine across the country of the Treveri to the frontiers of the Remi .
<start> Caesar , etsi intellegebat qua de causa ea dicerentur quaeque eum res ab instituto consilio deterreret , tamen , ne aestatem in Treveris consumere cogeretur omnibus ad Britannicum bellum rebus comparatis , Indutiomarum ad se cum CC obsidibus venire iussit . <end>$$Caesar , though he discerned from what motive these things were said , and what circumstances deterred him from his meditated plan , still , in order that he might not be compelled to waste the summer among the Treveri , while all things were prepared for the war with Britain , ordered Indutiomarus to come to him with 200 hostages .
<start> His adductis , in eis filio propinquisque eius omnibus , quos nominatim evocaverat , consolatus Indutiomarum hortatusque est uti in officio maneret ; nihilo tamen setius principibus Treverorum ad se convocatis hos singillatim Cingetorigi conciliavit , quod cum merito eius a se fieri intellegebat , tum magni interesse arbitrabatur eius auctoritatem inter suos quam plurimum valere , cuius tam egregiam in se voluntatem perspexisset . <end>$$When they were brought , among them his son and near relations , whom he had demanded by name , he consoled Indutiomarus , and enjoined him to continue in his allegiance ; yet , nevertheless , summoning to him the chief men of the Treveri , he reconciled them individually to Cingetorix : this he both thought should be done by him in justice to the merits of the latter , and also judged that it was of great importance that the influence of one whose singular attachment toward him he had fully seen , should prevail as much as possible among his people .
<start> Id tulit factum graviter Indutiomarus , suam gratiam inter suos minui , et , qui iam ante inimico in nos animo fuisset , multo gravius hoc dolore exarsit . <end>$$Indutiomarus was very much offended at this act , his influence was diminished among his countrymen ; and he , who already before had borne a hostile mind toward us , was much more violently inflamed against us through resentment at this .
<start> His rebus constitutis Caesar ad portum Itium cum legionibus pervenit . <end>$$These matters being settled , Caesar went to port Itius with the legions .
<start> Ibi cognoscit LX naves , quae in Meldis factae erant , tempestate reiectas cursum tenere non potuisse atque eodem unde erant profectae revertisse ; reliquas paratas ad navigandum atque omnibus rebus instructas invenit . <end>$$There he discovers that forty ships , which had been built in the country of the Meldi , having been driven back by a storm , had been unable to maintain their course , and had returned to the same port from which they had set out ; he finds the rest ready for sailing , and furnished with every thing .
<start> Eodem equitatus totius Galliae convenit , numero milium quattuor , principesque ex omnibus civitatibus ; ex quibus perpaucos , quorum in se fidem perspexerat , relinquere in Gallia , reliquos obsidum loco secum ducere decreverat , quod , cum ipse abesset , motum Galliae verebatur . <end>$$In the same place , the cavalry of the whole of Gaul , in number 4 , 000 , assembles , and the chief persons of all the states ; he had determined to leave in Gaul a very few of them , whose fidelity toward him he had clearly discerned , and take the rest with him as hostages ; because he feared a commotion in Gaul when he should be absent .
<start> Erat una cum ceteris Dumnorix Aeduus , de quo ante ab nobis dictum est . <end>$$There was together with the others , Dumnorix , the Aeduan , of whom we have made previous mention .
<start> Hunc secum habere in primis constituerat , quod eum cupidum rerum novarum , cupidum imperi , magni animi , magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis cognoverat . <end>$$Him , in particular , he had resolved to have with him , because he had discovered him to be fond of change , fond of power , possessing great resolution , and great influence among the Gauls .
<start> Accedebat huc quod in concilio Aeduorum Dumnorix dixerat sibi a Caesare regnum civitatis deferri ; quod dictum Aedui graviter ferebant , neque recusandi aut deprecandi causa legatos ad Caesarem mittere audebant . <end>$$To this was added , that Dumnorix had before said in an assembly of Aeduans , that the sovereignty of the state had been made over to him by Caesar ; which speech the Aedui bore with impatience and yet dared not send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of either rejecting or deprecating  .
<start> Id factum ex suis hospitibus Caesar cognoverat . <end>$$That fact Caesar had learned from his own personal friends .
<start> Ille omnibus primo precibus petere contendit ut in Gallia relinqueretur , partim quod insuetus navigandi mare timeret , partim quod religionibus impediri sese diceret . <end>$$He at first strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should be left in Gaul ; partly , because , being unaccustomed to sailing , he feared the sea ; partly because he said he was prevented by divine admonitions .
<start> Posteaquam id obstinate sibi negari vidit , omni spe impetrandi adempta principes Galliae sollicitare , sevocare singulos hortarique coepit uti in continenti remanerent metu territare : non sine causa fieri , ut Gallia omni nobilitate spoliaretur ; id esse consilium Caesaris , ut quos in conspectu Galliae interficere vereretur , hos omnes in Britanniam traductos necaret ; fidem reliquis interponere , iusiurandum poscere , ut quod esse ex usu Galliae intellexissent communi consilio administrarent . <end>$$After he saw that this request was firmly refused him , all hope of success being lost , he began to tamper with the chief persons of the Gauls , to call them apart singly and exhort them to remain on the continent ; to agitate them with the fear that it was not without reason that Gaul should be stripped of all her nobility ; that it was Caesar's design , to bring over to Britain and put to death all those whom he feared to slay in the sight of Gaul , to pledge his honor to the rest , to ask for their oath that they would by common deliberation execute what they should perceive to be necessary for Gaul .
<start> Haec a compluribus ad Caesarem deferebantur . <end>$$These things were reported to Caesar by several persons .
<start> Qua re cognita Caesar , quod tantum civitati Aeduae dignitatis tribuebat , coercendum atque deterrendum quibuscumque rebus posset Dumnorigem statuebat ; quod longius eius amentiam progredi videbat , prospiciendum , ne quid sibi ac rei publicae nocere posset . <end>$$Having learned this fact , Caesar , because he had conferred so much honor upon the Aeduan state , determined that Dumnorix should be restrained and deterred by whatever means he could ; and that , because he perceived his insane designs to be proceeding further and further , care should be taken lest he might be able to injure him and the commonwealth .
<start> Itaque dies circiter XXV in eo loco commoratus , quod Corus ventus navigationem impediebat , qui magnam partem omnis temporis in his locis flare consuevit , dabat operam ut in officio Dumnorigem contineret , nihilo tamen setius omnia eius consilia cognosceret : tandem idoneam nactus tempestatem milites equitesque conscendere in naves iubet . <end>$$Therefore , having stayed about twenty-five days in that place , because the north wind , which usually blows a great part of every season , prevented the voyage , he exerted himself to keep Dumnorix in his allegiance nevertheless learn all his measures : having at length met with favorable weather , he orders the foot soldiers and the horse to embark in the ships .
<start> At omnium impeditis animis Dumnorix cum equitibus Aeduorum a castris insciente Caesare domum discedere coepit . <end>$$But , while the minds of all were occupied , Dumnorix began to take his departure from the camp homeward with the cavalry of the Aedui , Caesar being ignorant of it .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Caesar intermissa profectione atque omnibus rebus postpositis magnam partem equitatus ad eum insequendum mittit retrahique imperat ; si vim faciat neque pareat , interfici iubet , nihil hunc se absente pro sano facturum arbitratus , qui praesentis imperium neglexisset . <end>$$Caesar , on this matter being reported to him , ceasing from his expedition and deferring all other affairs , sends a great part of the cavalry to pursue him , and commands that he be brought back ; he orders that if he use violence and do not submit , that he be slain ; considering that Dumnorix would do nothing as a rational man while he himself was absent , since he had disregarded his command even when present .
<start> Ille enim revocatus resistere ac se manu defendere suorumque fidem implorare coepit , saepe clamitans liberum se liberaeque esse civitatis . <end>$$He , however , when recalled , began to resist and defend himself with his hand , and implore the support of his people , often exclaiming that he was free and the subject of a free state .
<start> Illi , ut erat imperatum , circumsistunt hominem atque interficiunt : at equites Aedui ad Caesarem omnes revertuntur . <end>$$They surround and kill the man as they had been commanded ; but the Aeduan horsemen all return to Caesar .
<start> His rebus gestis , Labieno in continente cum tribus legionibus et equitum milibus duobus relicto ut portus tueretur et rem frumentariam provideret quaeque in Gallia gererentur cognosceret consiliumque pro tempore et pro re caperet , ipse cum quinque legionibus et pari numero equitum , quem in continenti reliquerat , ad solis occasum naves solvit et leni Africo provectus media circiter nocte vento intermisso cursum non tenuit , et longius delatus aestu orta luce sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit . <end>$$When these things were done Labienus , left on the continent with three legions and 2 , 000 horse , to defend the harbors and provide corn , and discover what was going on in Gaul , and take measures according to the occasion and according to the circumstance ; he himself , with five legions and a number of horse , equal to that which he was leaving on the continent , set sail at sun-set , and borne forward by a gentle south-west wind , he did not maintain his course , in consequence of the wind dying away about midnight , and being carried on too far by the tide , when the sun rose , espied Britain passed on his left .
<start> Tum rursus aestus commutationem secutus remis contendit ut eam partem insulae caperet , qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat Qua in re admodum fuit militum virtus laudanda , qui vectoriis gravibusque navigiis non intermisso remigandi labore longarum navium cursum adaequarunt . <end>$$Then , again , following the change of tide , he urged on with the oars that he might make that part of the island in which he had discovered the preceding summer , that there was the best landing-place , and in this affair the spirit of our soldiers was very much to be extolled ; for they with the transports and heavy ships , the labor of rowing not being discontinued , equaled the speed of the ships of war .
<start> Accessum est ad Britanniam omnibus navibus meridiano fere tempore , neque in eo loco hostis est visus ; sed , ut postea Caesar ex captivis cognovit , cum magnae manus eo convenissent , multitudine navium perterritae , quae cum annotinis privatisque quas sui quisque commodi fecerat amplius octingentae uno erant visae tempore , a litore discesserant ac se in superiora loca abdiderant . <end>$$All the ships reached Britain nearly at mid-day ; nor was there seen a enemy in that place , but , as Caesar afterward found from some prisoners , though large bodies of troops had assembled there , yet being alarmed by the great number of our ships , more than eight hundred of which , including the ships of the preceding year , and those private vessels which each had built for his own convenience , had appeared at one time , they had quitted the coast and concealed themselves among the higher points .
<start> Caesar exposito exercitu et loco castris idoneo capto , ubi ex captivis cognovit quo in loco hostium copiae consedissent , cohortibus decem ad mare relictis et equitibus trecentis , qui praesidio navibus essent , de tertia vigilia ad hostes contendit , eo minus veritus navibus , quod in litore molli atque aperto deligatas ad ancoram relinquebat , et praesidio navibus Quintus Atrium praefecit . <end>$$Caesar , having disembarked his army and chosen a convenient place for the camp , when he discovered from the prisoners in what part the forces of the enemy had lodged themselves , having left ten cohorts and 300 horse at the sea , to be a guard to the ships , hastens to the enemy , at the third watch , fearing the less for the ships , for this reason because he was leaving them fastened at anchor upon an even and open shore ; and he placed Quintus Atrius over the guard of the ships .
<start> Ipse noctu progressus milia passuum circiter XII hostium copias conspicatus est . <end>$$He himself , having advanced by night about twelve miles , espied the forces of the enemy .
<start> Illi equitatu atque essedis ad flumen progressi ex loco superiore nostros prohibere et proelium committere coeperunt . <end>$$They , advancing to the river with their cavalry and chariots from the higher ground , began to annoy our men and give battle .
<start> Repulsi ab equitatu se in silvas abdiderunt , locum nacti egregie et natura et opere munitum , quem domestici belli , ut videbantur , causa iam ante praeparaverant : nam crebris arboribus succisis omnes introitus erant praeclusi . <end>$$Being repulsed by our cavalry , they concealed themselves in woods , as they had secured a place admirably fortified by nature and by art , which , as it seemed , they had before prepared on account of a civil war ; for all entrances to it were shut up by a great number of felled trees .
<start> Ipsi ex silvis rari propugnabant nostrosque intra munitiones ingredi prohibebant . <end>$$They themselves rushed out of the woods to fight here and there , and prevented our men from entering their fortifications .
<start> At milites legionis septimae , testudine facta et aggere ad munitiones adiecto , locum ceperunt eosque ex silvis expulerunt paucis vulneribus acceptis . <end>$$But the soldiers of the seventh legion , having formed a testudo and thrown up a rampart against the fortification , took the place and drove them out of the woods , receiving only a few wounds .
<start> Sed eos fugientes longius Caesar prosequi vetuit , et quod loci naturam ignorabat , et quod magna parte diei consumpta munitioni castrorum tempus relinqui volebat . <end>$$But Caesar forbade his men to pursue them in their flight any great distance ; both because he was ignorant of the nature of the ground , and because , as a great part of the day was spent , he wished time to be left for the fortification of the camp .
<start> Postridie eius diei mane tripertito milites equitesque in expeditionem misit , ut eos qui fugerant persequerentur . <end>$$The next day , early in the morning , he sent both foot-soldiers and horse in three divisions on an expedition to pursue those who had fled .
<start> His aliquantum itineris progressis , cum iam extremi essent in prospectu , equites a Quinto Atrio ad Caesarem venerunt , qui nuntiarent superiore nocte maxima coorta tempestate prope omnes naves adflictas atque in litore eiectas esse , quod neque ancorae funesque subsisterent , neque nautae gubernatoresque vim tempestatis pati possent ; itaque ex eo concursu navium magnum esse incommodum acceptum . <end>$$These having advanced a little way , when already the rear was in sight , some horse came to Caesar from Quintus Atrius , to report that the preceding night , a very great storm having arisen , almost all the ships were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore , because neither the anchors and cables could resist , nor could the sailors and pilots sustain the violence of the storm ; and thus great damage was received by that collision of the ships .
<start> His rebus cognitis Caesar legiones equitatumque revocari atque in itinere resistere iubet , ipse ad naves revertitur ; eadem fere quae ex nuntiis litterisque cognoverat coram perspicit , sic ut amissis circiter XL navibus reliquae tamen refici posse magno negotio viderentur . <end>$$These things being known , Caesar orders the legions and cavalry to be recalled and to cease from their march ; he himself returns to the ships : he sees clearly before him almost the same things which he had heard of from the messengers and by letter , so that , about forty ships being lost , the remainder seemed capable of being repaired with much labor .
<start> Itaque ex legionibus fabros deligit et ex continenti alios arcessi iubet ; Labieno scribit , ut quam plurimas posset eis legionibus , quae sunt apud eum , naves instituat . <end>$$Therefore he selects workmen from the legions , and orders others to be sent for from the continent ; he writes to Labienus to build as many ships as he could with those legions which were with him .
<start> Ipse , etsi res erat multae operae ac laboris , tamen commodissimum esse statuit omnes naves subduci et cum castris una munitione coniungi . <end>$$He himself , though the matter was one of great difficulty and labor , yet thought it to be most expedient for all the ships to be brought up on shore and joined with the camp by one fortification .
<start> In his rebus circiter dies X consumit ne nocturnis quidem temporibus ad laborem militum intermissis . <end>$$In these matters he employed about ten days , the labor of the soldiers being unremitting even during the hours of night .
<start> Subductis navibus castrisque egregie munitis easdem copias , quas ante , praesidio navibus reliquit : ipse eodem unde redierat proficiscitur . <end>$$The ships having been brought up on shore and the camp strongly fortified , he left the same forces as he did before as a guard for the ships ; he sets out in person for the same place that he had returned from .
<start> Eo cum venisset , maiores iam undique in eum locum copiae Britannorum convenerant summa imperi bellique administrandi communi consilio permissa Cassivellauno , cuius fines a maritimis civitatibus flumen dividit , quod appellatur Tamesis , a mari circiter milia passuum LXXX . <end>$$When he had come thither , greater forces of the Britons had already assembled at that place , the chief command and management of the war having been intrusted to Cassivellaunus , whose territories a river , which is called the Thames , separates , from the maritime states at about eighty miles from the sea .
<start> Huic superiore tempore cum reliquis civitatibus continentia bella intercesserant ; sed nostro adventu permoti Britanni hunc toti bello imperioque praefecerant . <end>$$At an earlier period perpetual wars had taken place between him and the other states ; but , greatly alarmed by our arrival , the Britons had placed him over the whole war and the conduct of it .
<start> Britanniae pars interior ab eis incolitur quos natos in insula ipsi memoria proditum dicunt , maritima ab eis , qui praedae ac belli inferendi causa ex Belgio transierunt (qui omnes fere eis nominibus civitatum appellantur , quibus orti ex civitatibus eo pervenerunt) et bello illato ibi permanserunt atque agros colere coeperunt . <end>$$The interior portion of Britain is inhabited by those of whom they say that it is handed down by tradition that they were born in the island itself : the maritime portion by those who had passed over from the country of the Belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war ; almost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which being sprung they went thither , and having waged war , continued there and began to cultivate the lands .
<start> Hominum est infinita multitudo creberrimaque aedificia fere Gallicis consimilia , pecorum magnus numerus . <end>$$The number of the people is countless , and their buildings exceedingly numerous , for the most part very like those of the Gauls : the number of cattle is great .
<start> Vtuntur aut aere aut nummo aureo aut taleis ferreis ad certum pondus examinatis pro nummo . <end>$$They use either brass or iron rings , determined at a certain weight , as their money .
<start> Nascitur ibi plumbum album in mediterraneis regionibus , in maritimis ferrum , sed eius exigua est copia ; aere utuntur importato . <end>$$Tin is produced in the midland regions ; in the maritime , iron ; but the quantity of it is small : they employ brass , which is imported .
<start> Materia cuiusque generis ut in Gallia est , praeter fagum atque abietem . <end>$$There , as in Gaul , is timber of every description , except beech and fir .
<start> Leporem et gallinam et anserem gustare fas non putant ; haec tamen alunt animi voluptatisque causa . <end>$$They do not regard it lawful to eat the hare , and the cock , and the goose ; they , however , breed them for amusement and pleasure .
<start> Loca sunt temperatiora quam in Gallia , remissioribus frigoribus . <end>$$The climate is more temperate than in Gaul , the colds being less severe .
<start> Insula natura triquetra , cuius unum latus est contra Galliam . <end>$$The island is triangular in its form , and one of its sides is opposite to Gaul .
<start> Huius lateris alter angulus , qui est ad Cantium , quo fere omnes ex Gallia naves appelluntur , ad orientem solem , inferior ad meridiem spectat . <end>$$One angle of this side , which is in Kent , whither almost all ships from Gaul are directed , to the east ; the lower looks to the south .
<start> Hoc pertinet circiter mila passuum quingenta . <end>$$This side extends about 500 miles .
<start> Alterum vergit ad Hispaniam atque occidentem solem ; qua ex parte est Hibernia , dimidio minor , ut aestimatur , quam Britannia , sed pari spatio transmissus atque ex Gallia est in Britanniam . <end>$$Another side lies toward Spain and the west , on which part is Ireland , less , as is reckoned , than Britain , by one half : but the passage into Britain is of equal distance with that from Gaul .
<start> In hoc medio cursu est insula , quae appellatur Mona : complures praeterea minores subiectae insulae existimantur , de quibus insulis nonnulli scripserunt dies continuos triginta sub bruma esse noctem . <end>$$In the middle of this voyage , is an island , which is called Mona : many smaller islands besides are supposed to lie , of which islands some have written that at the time of the winter solstice it is night there for thirty consecutive days .
<start> Nos nihil de eo percontationibus reperiebamus , nisi certis ex aqua mensuris breviores esse quam in continenti noctes videbamus . <end>$$We , in our inquiries about that matter , ascertained nothing , except that , by accurate measurements with water , we perceived the nights to be shorter there than on the continent .
<start> Huius est longitudo lateris , ut fert illorum opinio , septingentorum milium . <end>$$The length of this side , as their account states , is 700 miles .
<start> Tertium est contra septentriones ; cui parti nulla est obiecta terra , sed eius angulus lateris maxime ad Germaniam spectat . <end>$$The third side is toward the north , to which portion of the island no land is opposite ; but an angle of that side looks principally toward Germany .
<start> Hoc milia passuum octingenta in longitudinem esse existimatur . <end>$$This side is considered to be 800 miles in length .
<start> Ita omnis insula est in circuitu vicies centum milium passuum . <end>$$Thus the whole island is 2 , 000 miles in circumference .
<start> Ex his omnibus longe sunt humanissimi qui Cantium incolunt , quae regio est maritima omnis , neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine . <end>$$The most civilized of all these nations are they who inhabit Kent , which is entirely a maritime district , nor do they differ much from the Gallic customs .
<start> Interiores plerique frumenta non serunt , sed lacte et carne vivunt pellibusque sunt vestiti . <end>$$All the Britons , indeed , dye themselves with woad , which occasions a bluish color , and thereby have a more terrible appearance in fight .
<start> Equites hostium essedariique acriter proelio cum equitatu nostro in itinere conflixerunt , tamen ut nostri omnibus partibus superiores fuerint atque eos in silvas collesque compulerint ; sed compluribus interfectis cupidius insecuti nonnullos ex suis amiserunt . <end>$$The horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in a skirmish with our cavalry on the march ; yet so that our men were conquerors in all parts , and drove them to their woods and hills ; but , having slain a great many , they pursued too eagerly , and lost some of their men .
<start> At illi intermisso spatio imprudentibus nostris atque occupatis in munitione castrorum subito se ex statione pro castris collocati , acriter pugnaverunt , duabusque missis subsidio cohortibus a Caesare atque eis primis legionum duarum , cum hae perexiguo intermisso loci spatio inter se constitissent , novo genere pugnae perterritis nostris per medios audacissime perruperunt seque inde incolumes receperunt . <end>$$But the enemy , after some time had elapsed , when our men were off their guard , and occupied in the fortification of the camp , rushed out of the woods , and making an attack upon those who were placed on duty before the camp , fought in a determined manner ; and two cohorts being sent by Caesar to their relief , and these severally the first of two legions , when these had taken up their position at a very small distance from each other , as our men were disconcerted by the unusual mode of battle , the enemy broke through the middle of them most courageously , and retreated thence in safety .
<start> Eo die Quintus Laberius Durus , tribunus militum , interficitur . <end>$$That day , Quintus Laberius Durus , a tribune of the soldiers , was slain .
<start> Illi pluribus submissis cohortibus repelluntur . <end>$$The enemy , since more cohorts were sent against them , were repulsed .
<start> Toto hoc in genere pugnae , cum sub oculis omnium ac pro castris dimicaretur , intellectum est nostros propter gravitatem armorum , quod neque insequi cedentes possent neque ab signis discedere auderent , minus aptos esse ad huius generis hostem , equites autem magno cum periculo proelio dimicare , propterea quod illi etiam consulto plerumque cederent et , cum paulum ab legionibus nostros removissent , ex essedis desilirent et pedibus dispari proelio contenderent . <end>$$In the whole of this method of fighting since the engagement took place under the eyes of all and before the camp , it was perceived that our men , on account of the weight of their arms , inasmuch as they could neither pursue retreating , nor dare quit their standards , were little suited to this kind of enemy ; that the horse also fought with great danger , because they generally retreated even designedly , and , when they had drawn off our men a short distance from the legions , leaped from their chariots and fought on foot in unequal battle .
<start> Equestris autem proeli ratio et cedentibus et insequentibus par atque idem periculum inferebat . <end>$$But the system of cavalry engagement is wont to produce equal danger , and indeed the same , both to those who retreat and to those who pursue .
<start> Accedebat huc ut numquam conferti sed rari magnisque intervallis proeliarentur stationesque dispositas haberent , atque alios alii deinceps exciperent , integrique et recentes defetigatis succederent . <end>$$To this was added , that they never fought in close order , but in small parties and at great distances , and had detachments placed , and then the one relieved the other , and the vigorous and fresh succeeded the wearied .
<start> Postero die procul a castris hostes in collibus constiterunt rarique se ostendere et lenius quam pridie nostros equites proelio lacessere coeperunt . <end>$$The following day the enemy halted on the hills , a distance from our camp , and presented themselves in small parties , and began to challenge our horse to battle with less spirit than the day before .
<start> Sed meridie , cum Caesar pabulandi causa tres legiones atque omnem equitatum cum Gaio Trebonio legato misisset , repente ex omnibus partibus ad pabulatores advolaverunt , sic uti ab signis legionibusque non absisterent . <end>$$But at noon , when Caesar had sent three legions , and all the cavalry , with Gaius Trebonius , the legate , for the purpose of foraging , they flew upon the foragers suddenly from all quarters , so that they did not keep off from the standards and the legions .
<start> Nostri acriter in eos impetu facto reppulerunt neque finem sequendi fecerunt , quoad subsidio confisi equites , cum post se legiones viderent , praecipites hostes egerunt magnoque eorum numero interfecto neque sui colligendi neque consistendi aut ex essedis desiliendi facultatem dederunt . <end>$$Our men making an attack on them vigorously , repulsed them ; nor did they cease to pursue them until the horse , relying on relief , as they saw the legions behind them , drove the enemy precipitately before them , and slaying a great number of them , did not give them the opportunity either of rallying , or halting , or leaping from their chariots .
<start> Ex hac fuga protinus , quae undique convenerant , auxilia discesserunt , neque post id tempus umquam summis nobiscum copiis hostes contenderunt . <end>$$Immediately after this retreat , the auxiliaries who had assembled from all sides , departed ; nor after that time did the enemy ever engage with us in very large numbers .
<start> Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen Tamesim in fines Cassivellauni exercitum duxit ; quod flumen uno omnino loco pedibus , atque hoc aegre , transiri potest . <end>$$Caesar , discovering their design , leads his army into the territories of Cassivellaunus to the river Thames ; which river can be forded in one place only and that with difficulty .
<start> Eo cum venisset , animum advertit ad alteram fluminis ripam magnas esse copias hostium instructas Ripa autem erat acutis sudibus praefixis munita , eiusdemque generis sub aqua defixae sudes flumine tegebantur . <end>$$When he had arrived there , he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were marshaled on the other bank of the river ; the bank also was defended by sharp stakes fixed in front , and stakes of the same kind fixed under the water were covered by the river .
<start> His rebus cognitis a captivis perfugisque Caesar praemisso equitatu confestim legiones subsequi iussit . <end>$$These things being discovered from prisoners and deserters , Caesar , sending forward the cavalry , ordered the legions to follow them immediately .
<start> Sed ea celeritate atque eo impetu milites ierunt , cum capite solo ex aqua exstarent , ut hostes impetum legionum atque equitum sustinere non possent ripasque dimitterent ac se fugae mandarent . <end>$$But the soldiers advanced with such speed and such ardor , though they stood above the water by their heads only , that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legions and of the horse , and quitted the banks , and committed themselves to flight .
<start> Cassivellaunus , ut supra demonstravimus , omni deposita spe contentionis dimissis amplioribus copiis milibus circiter quattuor essedariorum relictis itinera nostra servabat paulumque ex via excedebat locisque impeditis ac silvestribus sese occultabat , atque eis regionibus quibus nos iter facturos cognoverat pecora atque homines ex agris in silvas compellebat et , cum equitatus noster liberius praedandi vastandique causa se in agros eiecerat , omnibus viis semitisque essedarios ex silvis emittebat et magno cum periculo nostrorum equitum cum eis confligebat atque hoc metu latius vagari prohibebat . <end>$$Cassivellaunus , as we have stated above , all hope of battle being laid aside , the greater part of his forces being dismissed , and about 4 , 000 charioteers only being left , used to observe our marches and retire a little from the road , and conceal himself in intricate and woody places , and in those neighborhoods in which he had discovered we were about to march , he used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from the fields into the woods ; and , when our cavalry , for the sake of plundering and ravaging the more freely , scattered themselves among the fields , he used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the well-known roads and paths , and to the great danger of our horse , engage with them ; and this source of fear hindered them from straggling very extensively .
<start> Relinquebatur ut neque longius ab agmine legionum discedi Caesar pateretur , et tantum in agris vastandis incendiisque faciendis hostibus noceretur , quantum labore atque itinere legionarii milites efficere poterant . <end>$$The result was , that Caesar did not allow excursions to be made to a great distance from the main body of the legions , and ordered that damage should be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands , and kindling fires only so far as the legionary soldiers could , by their own exertion and marching , accomplish it .
<start> Interim Trinobantes , prope firmissima earum regionum civitas , ex qua Mandubracius adulescens Caesaris fidem secutus ad eum in continentem Galliam venerat , cuius pater in ea civitate regnum obtinuerat interfectusque erat a Cassivellauno , ipse fuga mortem vitaverat , legatos ad Caesarem mittunt pollicenturque sese ei dedituros atque imperata facturos ; petunt , ut Mandubracium ab iniuria Cassivellauni defendat atque in civitatem mittat , qui praesit imperiumque obtineat . <end>$$In the mean time , the Trinobantes , almost the most powerful state of those parts , from which the young man , Mandubracius embracing the protection of Caesar had come to the continent of Gaul to him , send embassadors to Caesar , and promise that they will surrender themselves to him and perform his commands ; they entreat him to protect Mandubracius from the violence of Cassivellaunus , and send to their state some one to preside over it , and possess the government .
<start> His Caesar imperat obsides quadraginta frumentumque exercitui Mandubraciumque ad eos mittit . <end>$$Caesar demands forty hostages from them , and corn for his army , and sends Mandubracius to them .
<start> Illi imperata celeriter fecerunt , obsides ad numerum frumentumque miserunt . <end>$$They speedily performed the things demanded , and sent hostages to the number appointed , and the corn .
<start> Trinobantibus defensis adque ab omni militum niuria prohibitis Cenimagni , Segontiaci , Ancalites , Bibroci , Cassi legationibus missis sese Caesari dedumt . <end>$$The Trinobantes being protected and secured from any violence of the soldiers , the Cenimagni , the Segontiaci , the Ancalites , the Bibroci , and the Cassi , sending embassies , surrendered themselves to Caesar .
<start> Oppidum autem Britanni vocant , cum silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt , quo incursionis hostium vitandae causa convenire consuerunt . <end>$$From them he learns that the capital town of Cassivellaunus was not far from that place , and was defended by woods and morasses , and a very large number of men and of cattle had been collected in it .
<start> Eo proficiscitur cum legionibus : locum reperit egregie natura atque opere munitum ; tamen hunc duabus ex partibus oppugnare contendit . <end>$$Thither he proceeds with his legions : he finds the place admirably fortified by nature and art ; he , however , undertakes to attack it in two directions .
<start> Hostes paulisper morati militum nostrorum impetum non tulerunt seseque alia ex parte oppidi eiecerunt . <end>$$The enemy , having remained only a short time , did not sustain the attack of our soldiers , and hurried away on the other side of the town .
<start> Dum haec in his locis geruntur , Cassivellaunus ad Cantium , quod esse ad mare supra demonstravimus , quibus regionibus quattuor reges praeerant , Cingetorix , Carvilius , Taximagulus , Segovax , nuntios mittit atque eis imperat uti coactis omnibus copiis castra navalia de improviso adoriantur atque oppugent . <end>$$While these things are going forward in those places , Cassivellaunus sends messengers into Kent , which , we have observed above , is on the sea , over which several districts four kings reigned , Cingetorix , Carvilius , Taximagulus and Segovax , and commands them to collect all their forces , and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval camp .
<start> Ei cum ad castra venissent , nostri eruptione facta multis eorum interfectis , capto etiam nobili duce Lugotorige suos incolumes reduxerunt . <end>$$When they had come to the camp , our men , after making a sally , slaying many of their men , and also capturing a distinguished leader named Lugotorix , brought back their own men in safety .
<start> Cassivellaunus hoc proelio nuntiato tot detrimentis acceptis , vastatis finibus , maxime etiam permotus defectione civitatum legatos per Atrebatem Commium de deditione ad Caesarem mittit . <end>$$Cassivellaunus , when this battle was reported to him as so many losses had been sustained , and his territories laid waste , being alarmed most of all by the desertion of the states , sends embassadors to Caesar about a surrender through the mediation of Commius the Atrebatian .
<start> Caesar , cum constituisset hiemare in continenti propter repentinos Galliae motus , neque multum aestatis superesset , atque id facile extrahi posse intellegeret , obsides imperat et quid in annos singulos vectigalis populo Romano Britannia penderet constituit ; interdicit atque imperat Cassivellauno , ne Mandubracio neu Trinobantibus noceat . <end>$$Caesar , since he had determined to pass the winter on the continent , on account of the sudden revolts of Gaul , and as much of the summer did not remain , and he perceived that even that could be easily protracted , demands hostages , and prescribes what tribute Britain should pay each year to the Roman people ; he forbids and commands Cassivellaunus that he not wage war against Mandubracius or the Trinobantes .
<start> Obsidibus acceptis exercitum reducit ad mare , naves invenit refectas . <end>$$When he had received the hostages , he leads back the army to the sea , and finds the ships repaired .
<start> His deductis , quod et captivorum magnum numerum habebat , et nonnullae tempestate deperierant naves , duobus commeatibus exercitum reportare instituit . <end>$$After launching these , because he had a large number of prisoners , and some of the ships had been lost in the storm , he determines to convey back his army at two embarkations .
<start> Ac sic accidit , uti ex tanto navium numero tot navigationibus neque hoc neque superiore anno ulla omnino navis , quae milites portaret , desideraretur ; at ex eis , quae inanes ex continenti ad eum remitterentur et prioris commeatus expositis militibus et quas postea Labienus faciendas curaverat numero LX , perpaucae locum caperent , reliquae fere omnes reicerentur Quas cum aliquamdiu Caesar frustra exspectasset , ne anni tempore a navigatione excluderetur , quod aequinoctium suberat , necessario angustius milites collocavit ac summa tranquillitate consecuta , secunda inita cum solvisset vigilia , prima luce terram attigit omnesque incolumes naves perduxit . <end>$$And it so happened , that out of so large a number of ships , in so many voyages , neither in this nor in the previous year was any ship missing which conveyed soldiers ; but very few out of those which were sent back to him from the continent empty , as the soldiers of the former convoy had been disembarked , and out of those which Labienus had taken care to have built , reached their destination ; almost all the rest were driven back , and when Caesar had waited for them for some time in vain , lest he should be debarred from a voyage by the season of the year , inasmuch as the equinox was at hand , he of necessity stowed his soldiers the more closely , and , a very great calm coming on , after he had weighed anchor at the beginning of the second watch , he reached land at break of day and brought in all the ships in safety .
<start> Subductis navibus concilioque Gallorum Samarobrivae peracto , quod eo anno frumentum in Gallia propter siccitates angustius provenerat , coactus est aliter ac superioribus annis exercitum in hibernis collocare legionesque in plures civitates distribuere Ex quibus unam in Morinos ducendam Gaio Fabio legato dedit , alteram in Nervios Quinto Ciceroni , tertiam in Esubios Lucio Roscio ; quartam in Remis cum Tito Labieno in confinio Treverorum hiemare iussit . <end>$$The ships having been drawn up and a general assembly of the Gauls held at Samarobriva , because the corn that year had not prospered in Gaul by reason of the droughts , he was compelled to station his army in its winter-quarters differently from the former years , and to distribute the legions among several states : one of them he gave to Gaius Fabius , his legate , to be marched into the territories of the Morini ; a second to Quintus Cicero , into those of the Nervii ; a third to Lucius Roscius , into those of the Esubii ; a fourth he ordered to winter with Titus Labienus among the Remi in the confines of the Treveri ; he stationed three in Belgium ; over these he appointed Marcus Crassus , his quaestor , and Lucius Munatius Plancus and Gaius Trebonius , his legates .
<start> Tres in Belgis collocavit : eis Marcum Crassum quaestorem et Lucium Munatium Plancum et Gaium Trebonium legatos praefecit Vnam legionem , quam proxime trans Padum conscripserat , et cohortes V in Eburones , quorum pars maxima est inter Mosam ac Rhenum , qui sub imperio Ambiorigis et Catuvolci erant , misit . <end>$$One legion which he had raised last on the other side of the Po , and five cohorts , he sent among the Eburones , the greatest portion of whom lie between the Meuse and the Rhine , who were under the government of Ambiorix and Catuvolcus .
<start> Eis militibus Quintum Titurium Sabinum et Lucium Aurunculeium Cottam legatos praeesse iussit . <end>$$He ordered Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta , his legates , to take command of these soldiers .
<start> Ad hunc modum distributis legionibus facillime inopiae frumentariae sese mederi posse existimavit Atque harum tamen omnium legionum hiberna praeter eam , quam Lucio Roscio im pacatissimam et quietissimam partem ducendam dederat , milibus passuum centum continebantur . <end>$$The legions being distributed in this manner , he thought he could most easily remedy the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarters of all these legions were comprehended within 100 miles .
<start> Ipse interea , quoad legiones collocatas munitaque hiberna cognovisset , in Gallia morari constituit . <end>$$He himself in the mean while , until he had stationed the legions and knew that the several winter-quarters were fortified , determined to stay in Gaul .
<start> Erat in Carnutibus summo loco natus Tasgetius , cuius maiores in sua civitate regnum obtinuerant . <end>$$There was among the Carnutes a man named Tasgetius , born of very high rank , whose ancestors had held the sovereignty in his state .
<start> Huic Caesar pro eius virtute atque in se benevolentia , quod in omnibus bellis singulari eius onera fuerat usus , maiorum locum restituerat . <end>$$To him Caesar had restored the position of his ancestors , in consideration of his prowess and attachment toward him , because in all his wars he had availed himself of his valuable services .
<start> Tertium iam hunc annum regnantem inimici , multis palam ex civitate eius auctoribus , eum interfecerunt . <end>$$His personal enemies had killed him when in the third year of his reign , many even of his own state being openly promoters This event is related to Caesar .
<start> Defertur ea res ad Caesarem Ille veritus , quod ad plures pertinebat , ne civitas eorum impulsu deficeret , Lucium Plancum cum legione ex Belgio celeriter in Carnutes proficisci iubet ibique hiemare quorumque opera cognoverat Tasgetium interfectum , hos comprehensos ad se mittere . <end>$$He fearing , because several were involved in the act , that the state might revolt at their instigation , orders Lucius Plancus , with a legion , to proceed quickly from Belgium to the Carnutes , and winter there , and arrest and send to him the persons by whose instrumentality he should discover that Tasgetius was slain .
<start> Interim ab omnibus legatis quaestoreque , quibus legiones tradiderat , certior factus est in hiberna perventum locumque hibernis esse munitum . <end>$$In the mean time , he was apprised by all the legates and quaestors to whom he had assigned the legions , that they had arrived in winter-quarters , and that the place for the quarters was fortified .
<start> Diebus circiter XV , quibus in hiberna ventum est , initium repentini tumultus ac defectionis ortum est ab Ambiorige et Catuvolco ; qui , cum ad fines regni sui Sabino Cottaeque praesto fuissent frumentumque in hiberna comportavissent , Indutiomari Treveri nuntiis impulsi suos concitaverunt subitoque oppressis lignatoribus magna manu ad castra oppugnatum venerunt . <end>$$About fifteen days after they had come into winter-quarters , the beginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arose from Ambiorix and Catuvolcus , who , though they had met with Sabinus and Cotta at the borders of their kingdom , and had conveyed corn into our winter-quarters , induced by the messages of Indutiomarus , one of the Treveri , excited their people , and after having suddenly assailed the soldiers engaged in procuring wood , came with a large body to attack the camp .
<start> Cum celeriter nostri arma cepissent vallumque adscendissent atque una ex parte Hispanis equitibus emissis equestri proelio superiores fuissent , desperata re hostes suos ab oppugnatione reduxerunt . <end>$$When our men had speedily taken up arms and had ascended the rampart , and sending out some Spanish horse on one side , had proved conquerors in a cavalry action , the enemy , despairing of success , drew off their troops from the assault .
<start> Tum suo more conclamaverunt , uti aliqui ex nostris ad colloquium prodiret : habere sese , quae de re communi dicere vellent , quibus rebus controversias minui posse sperarent . <end>$$Then they shouted , according to their custom , that some of our men should go forward to a conference , that they had some things which they desired to say respecting the common interest , by which they trusted their disputes could be removed .
<start> Mittitur ad eos colloquendi causa Gaius Arpineius , eques Romanus , familiaris Quinti Tituri , et Quintus Iunius ex Hispania quidam , qui iam ante missu Caesaris ad Ambiorigem ventitare consuerat ; apud quos Ambiorix ad hunc modum locutus est : Sese pro Caesaris in se beneficiis plurimum ei confiteri debere , quod eius opera stipendio liberatus esset , quod Aduatucis , finitimis suis , pendere consuesset , quodque ei et filius et fratris filius ab Caesare remissi essent , quos Aduatuci obsidum numero missos apud in servitute et catenis tenuissent ; neque id , quod tecerit de oppugnatione castrorum , aut iudicio aut voluntate sua fecisse , sed coactu civitatis , suaque esse eiusmodi imperia , ut non minus haberet iuris in se multitudo quam ipse in multitudinem . <end>$$Gaius Arpineius , a Roman knight , the intimate friend of Quintus Titurius , and with him , Quintus Junius , a certain person from Spain , who already on previous occasions , had been accustomed to go to Ambiorix , at Caesar's mission , is sent to them for the purpose of a conference : before them Ambiorix spoke to this effect : That he confessed , that for Caesar's kindness toward him , he was very much indebted to him , inasmuch as by his aid he had been freed from a tribute which he had been accustomed to pay to the Aduatuci , his neighbors ; and because his own son and the son of his brother had been sent back to him , whom , when sent in the number of hostages , the Aduatuci had detained among them in slavery and in chains ; and that he had not done that which he had done in regard to the attacking of the camp , either by his own judgment or desire , but by the compulsion of his state ; and that his government was of that nature , that the people had as much authority over him as he over the people .
<start> Non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse , praesertim cum de recuperanda communi libertate consilium initum videretur Quibus quoniam pro pietate satisfecerit , habere nunc se rationem offici pro beneficiis Caesaris : monere , orare Titurium pro hospitio , ut suae ac militum saluti consulat Magnam manum Germanorum conductam Rhenum transisse ; hanc adfore biduo Ipsorum esse consilium , velintne priusquam finitimi sentiant eductos ex hibernis milites aut ad Ciceronem aut ad Labienum deducere , quorum alter milia passuum circiter quinquaginta , alter paulo amplius ab eis absit . <end>$$To the state moreover the occasion of the war was this-that it could not withstand the sudden combination of the Gauls ; that he could easily prove this from his own weakness , since he was not so little versed in affairs as to presume that with his forces he could conquer the Roman people ; but that it was the common resolution of Gaul ; that that day was appointed for the storming of all Caesar's winter-quarters , in order that no legion should be able to come to the relief of another legion , that Gauls could not easily deny Gauls , especially when a measure seemed entered into for recovering their common freedom .
<start> Arpineius et Iunius , quae audierunt , ad legatoc deferunt . <end>$$Arpineius and Junius relate to the legates what they had heard .
<start> Illi repentina re perturbati , etsi ab hoste ea dicebantur , tamen non neglegenda existimabant maximeque hac re permovebantur , quod civitatem ignobilem atque humilem Eburonum sua sponte populo Romano bellum facere ausam vix erat credendum . <end>$$They , greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair , though those things were spoken by an enemy , still thought they were not to be disregarded ; and they were especially influenced by this consideration , that it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the Eburones had dared to make war upon the Roman people of their own accord .
<start> Itaque ad consilium rem deferunt magnaque inter eos exsistit controversia . <end>$$Accordingly , they refer the matter to a council , and a great controversy arises among them .
<start> Lucius Aummculeius compluresque tribuni militum et primorum ordinum centuriones nihil temere agendum neque ex hibernis iniussu Caesaris discedendum existimabant : quantasvis copias etiam Germanorum sustineri posse munitis hibernis docebant : rem esse testimonio , quod primum hostium impetum multis ultro vulneribus illatis fortissime sustinuerint : re frumentaria non premi ; interea et ex proximis hibernis et a Caesare conventura subsidia : postremo quid esse levius aut turpius , quam auctore hoste de summis rebus capere consilium ?  . <end>$$Lucius Aurunculeius , and several tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions of the first rank , were of opinion that nothing should be done hastily , and that they should not depart from the camp without Caesar's orders ; they declared , that any forces of the Germans , however great , might be encountered by fortified winter-quarters ; that this fact was a proof ; that they had sustained the first assault of the Germans most valiantly , inflicting many wounds upon them ; that they were not distressed for corn ; that in the mean time relief would come both from the nearest winter-quarters and from Caesar ; lastly , they put the query , what could be more undetermined , more undignified , than to adopt measures respecting the most important affairs on the authority of an enemy ?  .
<start> Contra ea Titurius sero facturos clamitabat , cum maiores manus hostium adiunctis Germanis convenissent aut cum aliquid calamitatis in proximis hibernis esset acceptum Brevem consulendi esse occasionem Caesarem arbitrari profectum in Italiam ; neque aliter Calnutes interficiendi Tasgeti consilium fuisse capturos , neque Eburones , si ille adesset , tanta contemptione nostri ad castra venturos esse Non hostem auctorem , sed rem spectare : subesse Rhenum ; magno esse Germanis dolori Ariovisti mortem et superiores nostras victorias ; ardere Galliam tot contumeliis acceptis sub populi Romani imperium redactam superiore gloria rei militaris exstincta . <end>$$In opposition to those things , Titurius exclaimed , That they would do this too late , when greater forces of the enemy , after a junction with the Germans , should have assembled ; or when some disaster had been received in the neighboring winter-quarters ; that the opportunity for deliberating was short ; that he believed that Caesar had set forth into Italy , as the Carnutes would not otherwise have taken the measure of slaying Tasgetius , nor would the Eburones , if he had been present , have come to the camp with so great defiance of us ; that he did not regard the enemy , but the fact , as the authority ; that the Rhine was near ; that the death of Ariovistus and our previous victories were subjects of great indignation to the Germans ; that Gaul was inflamed , that after having received so many defeats she was reduced under the sway of the Roman people , her pristine glory in military matters being extinguished .
<start> Postremo quis hoc sibi persuaderet , sine certa re Ambiorigem ad eiusmodi consilium descendisse ? Suam sententiam in utramque partem esse tutam : si nihil esset durius , nullo cum periculo ad proximam legionem perventuros ; si Gallia omnis cum Germanis consentiret , unam esse in celeritate positam salutem . <end>$$Lastly , who would persuade himself of this , that Ambiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without sure grounds ? That his own opinion was safe on either side ; if there be nothing very formidable , they would go without danger to the nearest legion ; if all Gaul conspired with the Germans , their only safety lay in dispatch .
<start> Cottae quidem atque eorum , qui dissentirent , consilium quem habere exitum ? In quo si non praesens periculum , at certe longinqua obsidione fames esset timenda . <end>$$What issue would the advice of Cotta and of those who differed from him , have ? from which , if immediate danger was not to be dreaded , yet certainly famine , by a protracted siege , was .
<start> Hac in utramque partem disputatione habita , cum a Cotta primisque ordinibus acriter resisteretur , Vincite , inquit , si ita vultis , Sabinus , et id clariore voce , ut magna pars militum exaudiret ; neque is sum , inquit , qui gravissime ex vobis mortis periculo terrear : hi sapient ; si gravius quid acciderit , abs te rationem reposcent , qui , si per te liceat , perendino die cum proximis hibernis coniuncti communem cum reliquis belli casum sustineant , non reiecti et relegati longe ab ceteris aut ferro aut fame intereant . <end>$$This discussion having been held on the two sides , when opposition was offered strenuously by Cotta and the principal officers , Prevail , said Sabinus , if so you wish it ; and he said it with a louder voice , that a great portion of the soldiers might hear him ; nor am I the person among you , he said , who is most powerfully alarmed by the danger of death ; these will be aware of it , and then , if any thing disastrous shall have occurred , they will demand a reckoning at your hands ; these , who , if it were permitted by you , united three days hence with the nearest winter-quarters , may encounter the common condition of war with the rest , and not , as if forced away and separated far from the rest , perish either by the sword or by famine .
<start> Consurgitur ex consilio ; comprehendunt utrumque et orant , ne sua dissensione et pertinacia rem in summum periculum deducat : facilem esse rem , seu maneant , seu proficiscantur , si modo unum omnes sentiant ac probent ; contra in dissensione nullam se salutem perspicere . <end>$$They rise from the council , detain both , and entreat , that they do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their dissension and obstinacy ; the affair was an easy one , if only they all thought and approved of the same thing , whether they remain or depart ; on the other hand , they saw no security in dissension .
<start> Res disputatione ad mediam noctem perducitur . <end>$$The matter is prolonged by debate till midnight .
<start> Tandem dat Cotta permotus manus : superat sententia Sabini . <end>$$At last Cotta , being overruled , yields his assent ; the opinion of Sabinus prevails .
<start> Pronuntiatu prima luce ituros Consumitur vigiliis reliqua pars noctis , cum sua quisque miles circumspiceret , quic secum portare posset , quid ex instrumento hibernorum relinquere cogeretur Omnia excogitantur , quare nec sine periculo maneatur , et languore militulr et vigiLus periculum augeatur . <end>$$It is proclaimed that they will march at day-break ; the remainder of the night is spent without sleep , since every soldier was inspecting his property , what he could carry with him , and what , out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters , he would be compelled to leave ; every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay without danger , and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the soldiers and their want of sleep .
<start> Prima luce sic ex castris proficiscuntur , ut quibus esset persuas non ab hoste , sed ab homine amicissimo Ambiorige consilium datum , longissimo agmine maximisque impedimentis . <end>$$At break of day they quit the camp , in a very extended line and with a very large amount of baggage , in such a manner as men who were convinced that the advice was given by Ambiorix , not as an enemy , but as most friendly  .
<start> At hostes , posteaquam ex nocturno fremitu vigiliicque de profectione eorum senserunt , collocatis in sidus bipertito in silvis opportuno atque occulto loco a milibus passuum circiter duobus Romanorum adventum exspectabant , et cum se maior pars agminis in magnam convallem demisisset , ex utraque parte eius vallis subito se ostenderunt novissimosque premere et primos prohibere ascensu atque iniquissimo nostris loco proelium committere coeperunt . <end>$$But the enemy , after they had made the discovery of their intended departure by the noise during the night and their not retiring to rest , having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the woods , in a suitable and concealed place , two miles from the camp , waited for the arrival of the Romans : and when the greater part of the line of march had descended into a considerable valley , they suddenly presented themselves on either side of that valley , and began both to harass the rear and hinder the van from ascending , and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous to our men .
<start> Tum demum Titurius , qui nihil ante providisset , trepidare et concursare cohortesque disponere , haec tamen ipsa timide atque ut eum omnia deficere viderentur ; quod plerumque eis accidere consuevit , qui in ipso negotio consilium capere coguntur . <end>$$Then at length Titurius , as one who had provided nothing beforehand , was confused , ran to and fro , and set about arranging his troops ; these very things , however , he did timidly and in such a manner that all resources seemed to fail him : which generally happens to those who are compelled to take council in the action itself .
<start> At Cotta , qui cogitasset haec posse in itinere accidere atque ob eam causam profectionis auctor non fuisset , nulla in re communi saluti deerat et in appellandis cohortandisque miLtibus imperatoris et in pugna militis officia praestabat . <end>$$But Cotta , who had reflected that these things might occur on the march , and on that account had not been an adviser of the departure , was wanting to the common safety in no respect ; both in addressing and encouraging the soldiers , he performed the duties of a general , and in the battle those of a soldier .
<start> Cum propter longitudinem agminis minus facile omnia per se obire et , quid quoque loco faciendum esset , providere possent , iusserunt pronuntiare , ut impedimenta relinquerent atque in orbem consisterent Quod consilium etsi in eiusmodi casu reprehendendum non est , tarmen incommode accidit : nam et nostris militibus spem minuit et hostes ad pugnam alacriores effecit , quod non sine summo timore et desperatione id factum videbatur . <end>$$And since they could less easily perform every thing by themselves , and provide what was to be done in each place , by reason of the length of the line of march , they ordered to give the command that they should leave the baggage and form themselves into an orb , which measure , though in a contingency of that nature it was not to be condemned , still turned out unfortunately ; for it both diminished the hope of our soldiers and rendered the enemy more eager for the fight , because it appeared that this was not done without the greatest fear and despair .
<start> Praeterea accidit , quod fieri necesse erat , ut vulgo milites ab signis discederent , quae quisque eorum carissima haberet , ab impedimentis petere atque arripere properaret , clamore et fletu omnia complerentur . <end>$$Besides that happened , which would necessarily be the case , that the soldiers for the most part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry off from the baggage whatever each thought valuable , and all parts were filled with uproar and lamentation .
<start> At barbaris consilium non defuit Nam duces eorum tota acie pronuntiare iusserunt , ne quis ab loco discederet : illorum esse praedam atque illis reservari quaecumque Romani reliquissent : proinde omnia in victoria posita existimarent . <end>$$But judgment was not wanting to the barbarians ; for their leaders ordered to proclaim through the ranks that no man should quit his place ; that the booty was theirs , and for them was reserved whatever the Romans should leave ; therefore let them consider that all things depended on their victory .
<start> Erant et virtute et studio pugnandi pares ; nostri , tametsi ab duce et a fortuna deserebantur , tamen omnem spem salutis in virtute ponebant , et quotiens quaeque cohors procurrerat , ab ea parte magnus numerus hostium cadebat . <end>$$Our men were equal to them in fighting , both in courage and in number , and though they were deserted by their leader and by fortune , yet they still placed all hope of safety in their valor , and as often as any cohort sallied forth on that side , a great number of the enemy usually fell .
<start> Qua re animadversa Ambiorix pronuntiari iubet , ut procul tela coniciant neu propius accedant et , quam in partem Romani impetum fecerint , cedant (levitate armorum et cotidiana exercitatione nihil eis noceri posse) , rursus se ad signa recipientes insequantur . <end>$$Ambiorix , when he observed this , orders the command to be issued that they throw their weapons from a distance and do not approach too near , and in whatever direction the Romans should make an attack , there give way ; pursue them when betaking themselves to their standards again .
<start> Quo praecepto ab eis diligentissime observato , cum quaepiam cohors ex orbe excesserat atque impetum fecerat , hostes velocissime refugiebant . <end>$$Which command having been most carefully obeyed , when any cohort had quitted the circle and made a charge , the enemy fled very precipitately .
<start> Rursus cum in eum locum unde erant egressi reverti coeperant , et ab eis qui cesserant et ab eis qui proximi steterant circumveniebantur ; sin autem locum tenere vellent , nec virtuti locus relinquebatur , neque ab tanta multitudine coniecta tela conferti vitare poterant . <end>$$Yet , though assailed by so many disadvantages , having received many wounds , they withstood the enemy , and , a great portion of the day being spent , though they fought from day-break till the eighth hour , they did nothing which was unworthy of them .
<start> Tamen tot incommodis conflictati , multis vulneribus acceptis resistebant et magna parte diei consumpta , cum a prima luce ad horam octavam pugnaretur , nihil quod ipsis esset indignum committebant . <end>$$At length , each thigh of T Balventius , who the year before had been chief centurion , a brave man and one of great authority , is pierced with a javelin ; Q Lucanius , of the same rank , fighting most valiantly , is slain while he assists his son when surrounded by the enemy ; L .
<start> His rebus permotus Quintus Titurius , cum procul Ambiorigem suos cohortantem conspexisset , interpretem suum Gnaeum Pompeium ad eum mittit rogatum ut sibi militibusque parcat . <end>$$Much troubled by these events , Q Titurius , when he had perceived Ambiorix in the distance encouraging his men , sends to him his interpreter , Cn .
<start> Ille appellatus respondit : si velit secum colloqui , licere ; sperare a multitudine impetrari posse , quod ad militum salutem pertineat ; ipsi vero nihil nocitum iri , inque eam rem se suam fidem interponere . <end>$$Pompey , to beg that he would spare him and his soldiers He , when addressed , replied , If he wishes to confer with him , it was permitted ; that he hoped what pertained to the safety of the soldiers could be obtained from the people ; that to him however certainly no injury would be done , and that he pledged his faith to that effect .
<start> Ille cum Cotta saucio communicat , si videatur , pugna ut excedant et cum Ambiorige una colloquantur : sperare ab eo de sua ac militum salute impetrari posse . <end>$$He consults with Cotta , who had been wounded , whether it would appear right to retire from battle , and confer with Ambiorix ; that he hoped to be able to succeed respecting his own and the soldiers' safety .
<start> Cotta se ad armatum hostem iturum negat atque in eo perseverat . <end>$$Cotta says he will not go to an armed enemy , and in that perseveres .
<start> Sabinus quos in praesentia tribunos militum circum se habebat et primorum ordinum centuriones se sequi iubet et , cum propius Ambiorigem accessisset , iussus arma abicere imperatum facit suisque ut idem faciant imperat . <end>$$Sabinus orders those tribunes of the soldiers whom he had at the time around him , and the centurions of the first ranks , to follow him , and when he had approached near to Ambiorix , being ordered to throw down his arms , he obeys the order and commands his men to do the same .
<start> Interim , dum de condicionibus inter se agunt longiorque consulto ab Ambiorige instituitur sermo , paulatim circumventus interficitur . <end>$$In the mean time , while they treat upon the terms , and a longer debate than necessary is designedly entered into by Ambiorix , being surrounded by degrees , he is slain .
<start> Tum vero suo more victoriam conclamant atque ululatum tollunt impetuque in nostros facto ordines perturbant . <end>$$Then they , according to their custom , shout out Victory , and raise their war-cry , and , making an attack on our men , break their ranks .
<start> Ex quibus Lucius Petrosidius aquilifer , cum magna multitudine hostium premeretur , aquilam intra vallum proiecit ; ipse pro castris fortissime pugnans occiditur . <end>$$Petrosidius , the standard bearer , when he was overpowered by the great number of the enemy , threw the eagle within the intrenchments and is himself slain while fighting with the greatest courage before the camp .
<start> Illi aegre ad noctem oppugnationem sustinent ; noctu ad unum omnes desperata salute se ipsi interficiunt . <end>$$They with difficulty sustain the attack till night ; despairing of safety , they all to a man destroy themselves in the night .
<start> Pauci ex proelio lapsi incertis itineribus per silvas ad Titum Labienum legatum in hiberna perveniunt atque eum de rebus gestis certiorem faciunt . <end>$$A few escaping from the battle , made their way to Labienus at winter-quarters , after wandering at random through the woods , and inform him of these events .
<start> Hac victoria sublatus Ambiorix statim cum equitatu in Aduatucos , qui erant eius regno finitimi , proficiscitur ; neque noctem neque diem intermittit peditatumque subsequi iubet . <end>$$Elated by this victory , Ambiorix marches immediately with his cavalry to the Aduatuci , who bordered on his kingdom ; he halts neither day nor night , and orders the infantry to follow him closely .
<start> Re demonstrata Aduatucisque concitatis postero die in Nervios pervenit hortaturque , ne sui in perpetuum liberandi atque ulciscendi Romanos pro eis quas acceperint iniuriis occasionem dimittant : interfectos esse legatos duos magnamque partem exercitus interisse demonstrat ; nihil esse negoti subito oppressam legionem quae cum Cicerone hiemet interfici ; se ad eam rem profitetur adiutorem . <end>$$Having related the exploit and roused the Aduatuci , the next day he arrived among the Nervii , and entreats that they should not throw away the opportunity of liberating themselves forever and of punishing the Romans for those wrongs which they had received from them ; that two lieutenants have been slain , and that a large portion of the army has perished ; that it was not a matter of difficulty for the legion which was wintering with Cicero to be cut off , when suddenly assaulted ; he declares himself ready to cooperate in that design .
<start> Facile hac oratione Nerviis persuadet . <end>$$He easily gains over the Nervii by this speech .
<start> Itaque confestim dimissis nuntiis ad Ceutrones , Grudios , Levacos , Pleumoxios , Geidumnos , qui omnes sub eorum imperio sunt , quam maximas manus possunt cogunt et de improviso ad Ciceronis hiberna advolant nondum ad eum fama de Tituri morte perlata . <end>$$Accordingly , messengers having been forthwith dispatched to the Centrones , the Grudii , the Levaci , the Pleumoxii , and the Geiduni , all of whom are under their government , they assemble as large bodies as they can , and rush unexpectedly to the winter-quarters of Cicero , the report of the death of Titurius not having as yet been conveyed to him .
<start> Huic quoque accidit , quod fuit necesse , ut nonnulli milites , qui lignationis munitionisque causa in silvas discessissent , repentino equitum adventu interciperentur . <end>$$That also occurred to him , which was the consequence of a necessary work-that some soldiers who had gone off into the woods for the purpose of procuring timber and therewith constructing fortifications , were intercepted by the sudden arrival of horse .
<start> His circumventis magna manu Eburones , Nervii , Aduatuci atque horum omnium socii et clientes legionem oppugnare incipiunt Nostri celeriter ad arma concurrunt , vallum conscendunt Aegre is dies sustentatur , quod omnem spem hostes in celeritate ponebant atque hanc adepti victoriam in perpetuum se fore victores confidebant . <end>$$These having been entrapped , the Eburones , the Nervii , and the Aduatici and all their allies and dependents , begin to attack the legion : our men quickly run together to arms and mount the rampart ; they sustained the attack that day with great difficulty , since the enemy placed all their hope in dispatch , and felt assured that , if they obtained this victory , they would be conquerors forever .
<start> Mittuntur ad Caesarem confestim ab Cicerone litterae magnis propositis praemiis , si pertulissent : obsessis omnibus viis missi intercipiuntur . <end>$$Letters are immediately sent to Caesar by Cicero , great rewards being offered if they carried them through .
<start> Nulla pars nocturni temporis ad laborem intermittitur ; non aegris , non vulneratis facultas quietis datur . <end>$$Resistance is made by our men in the same manner as the day before ; this same thing is done afterward during the remaining days .
<start> Quaecumque ad proximi diei oppugnationem opus sunt noctu comparantur ; multae praeustae sudes , magnus muralium pilorum numerus instituitur ; turres contabulantur , pinnae loricaeque ex cratibus attexuntur . <end>$$The work is carried on incessantly in the night : not even to the sick , or wounded , is opportunity given for rest : whatever things are required for resisting the assault of the next day are provided during the night : many stakes burned at the end , and a large number of mural pikes are procured : towers are built up , battlements and parapets are formed of interwoven hurdles .
<start> Ipse Cicero , cum tenuissima valetudine esset , ne nocturnum quidem sibi tempus ad quietem relinquebat , ut ultro militum concursu ae vocibus sibi parcere cogeretur . <end>$$Cicero himself , though he was in very weak health , did not leave himself the night-time for repose , so that he was forced to spare himself by the spontaneous movement and entreaties of the soldiers .
<start> Tunc duces principesque Nerviorum qui aliquem cermonis aditum causamque amicitiae cum Cicerone habebant colloqui sese velle dicunt . <end>$$Then these leaders and chiefs of the Nervii , who had any intimacy and grounds of friendship with Cicero , say they desire to confer with him .
<start> Facta potestate eadem quae Ambiorix cum Titurio egerat commemorant : omnem esse in armis Galliam ; Germanos Rhenum transisse ; Caesaris reliquorumque hiberna oppugnari . <end>$$When permission was granted , they recount the same things which Ambiorix had related to Titurius , namely , that all Gaul was in arms , that the Germans had passed the Rhine , that the winter-quarters of Caesar and of the others were attacked .
<start> Addunt etiam de Sabini morte : Ambiorigem ostentant fidei faciendae causa . <end>$$They report in addition also , about the death of Sabinus .
<start> Errare eos dicunt , si quidquam ab his praesidi sperent , qui suis rebus diffidant ; sese tamen hoc esse in Ciceronem populumque Romanum animo , ut nihil nisi hiberna recusent atque hanc inveterascere consuetudinem nolint : licere illis incolumibus per se ex hibernis discedere et quascumque in partes velint sine metu proficisci . <end>$$They point to Ambiorix for the purpose of obtaining credence ; they are mistaken , say they , if they hoped for any relief from those who distrust their own affairs ; that they bear such feelings toward Cicero and the Roman people that they deny them nothing but winter-quarters , and are unwilling that the practice should become constant ; that through their means it is possible for them to depart from their winter-quarters safely and to proceed without fear into whatever parts they desire .
<start> Cicero ad haec unum modo respondit : non esse consuetudinem populi Romani accipere ab hoste armato condicionem : si ab armis discedere velint , se adiutore utantur legatosque ad Caesarem mittant ; sperare pro eius iustitia , quae petierint , impetraturos . <end>$$To these Cicero made only one reply : that it is not the custom of the Roman people to accept any condition from an armed enemy : if they are willing to lay down their arms , they may employ him as their advocate and send embassadors to Caesar : that he believed , from his justice , they would obtain the things which they might request .
<start> Ab hac spe repulsi Nervii vallo pedum IX et fossa pedum XV hiberna cingunt . <end>$$Disappointed in this hope , the Nervii surround the winter-quarters with a rampart eleven feet high , and a ditch thirteen feet in depth .
<start> Haec et superiorum annorum consuetudine ab nobis cognoverant et , quos clam de exercitu habebant captivos , ab eis docebantur ; sed nulla ferramentorum copia quae esset ad hunc usum idonea , gladiis caespites circumcidere , manibus sagulisque terram exhaurire nitebantur Qua quidem ex re hominum multitudo cognosci potuit : nam minus horis tribus milium pedum XV in circuitu munitionem perfecerunt reliquisque diebus turres ad altitudinem valli , falces testudinesque , quas idem captivi docuerant , parare ac facere coeperunt . <end>$$These military works they had learned from our men in the intercourse of former years , and , having taken some of our army prisoners , were instructed by them : but , as they had no supply of iron tools which are requisite for this service , they were forced to cut the turf with their swords , and to empty out the earth with their hands and cloaks , from which circumstance , the vast number of the men could be inferred ; for in less than three hours they completed a fortification of ten miles in circumference ; and during the rest of the days they began to prepare and construct towers of the height of the ramparts , and grappling irons , and mantelets , which the same prisoners had taught them .
<start> Septimo oppugnationis die maximo coorto vento ferventes fusili ex argilla glandes fundis et fervefacta iacula in casas , quae more Gallico stramentis erant tectae , iacere coeperunt . <end>$$On the seventh day of the attack , a very high wind having risen up , they began to throw by their slings hot bullets made of softened clay , and heated javelins , upon the huts , which , after the Gallic custom , were thatched with straw .
<start> Hae celeriter ignem comprehenderunt et venti magnitudine in omnem locum castrorum distulerunt . <end>$$These quickly took fire , and by the violence of the wind , scattered their flames in every part of the camp .
<start> Hostes maximo clamore sicuti parta iam atque explorata victoria turres testudinesque agere et scalis vallum ascendere coeperunt . <end>$$The enemy following up their success with a very loud shout , as if victory were already obtained and secured , began to advance their towers and mantelets , and climb the rampart with ladders .
<start> At tanta militum virtus atque ea praesentia animi fuit , ut , cum undique flamma torrerentur maximaque telorum multitudine premerentur suaque omnia impedimenta atque omnes fortunas conflagrare intellegerent , non modo demigrandi causa de vallo decederet nemo , sed paene ne respiceret quidem quisquam , ac tum omnes acerrime fortissimeque pugnarent . <end>$$But so great was the courage of our soldiers , and such their presence of mind , that though they were scorched on all sides , and harassed by a vast number of weapons , and were aware that their baggage and their possessions were burning , not only did no one quit the rampart for the purpose of withdrawing from the scene , but scarcely did any one even then look behind ; and they all fought most vigorously and most valiantly .
<start> Hic dies nostris longe gravissimus fuit ; sed tamen hunc habuit eventum , ut eo die maximus numerus hostium vulneraretur atque interficeretur , ut se sub ipso vallo constipaverant recessumque primis ultimi non dabant . <end>$$This day was by far the most calamitous to our men ; it had this result , however , that on that day the largest number of the enemy was wounded and slain , since they had crowded beneath the very rampart , and the hindmost did not afford the foremost a retreat .
<start> Paulum quidem intermissa flamma et quodam loco turri adacta et contingente vallum tertiae cohortis centuriones ex eo , quo stabant , loco recesserunt suosque omnes removerunt , nutu vocibusque hostes , si introire vellent , vocare coeperunt ; quorum progredi ausus est nemo . <end>$$The flame having abated a little , and a tower having been brought up in a particular place and touching the rampart , the centurions of the third cohort retired from the place in which they were standing , and drew off all their men : they began to call on the enemy by gestures and by words , to enter if they wished ; but none of them dared to advance .
<start> Tum ex omni parte lapidibus coniectis deturbati , turrisque succensa est . <end>$$Then stones having been cast from every quarter , the enemy were dislodged , and their tower set on fire .
<start> Erant in ea legione fortissimi viri , centuriones , qui primis ordinibus appropinquarent , Titus Pullo et Lucius Vorenus . <end>$$In that legion there were two very brave men , centurions , who were now approaching the first ranks , T .
<start> Hi perpetuas inter se controversias habebant , quinam anteferretur , omnibusque annis de locis summis simultatibus contendebant . <end>$$Pullo , and L Vorenus These used to have continual disputes between them which of them should be preferred , and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity .
<start> Ex his Pullo , cum acerrime ad munitiones pugnaretur , Quid dubitas , inquit , Vorene ? aut quem locum tuae probandae virtutis exspectas  ? hic dies de nostris controversiis iudicabit . <end>$$When the fight was going on most vigorously before the fortifications , Pullo , one of them , says , Why do you hesitate , Vorenus ? or what opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek ? This very day shall decide our disputes .
<start> Haec cum dixisset , procedit extra munitiones quaque pars hostium confertissma est visa irrumpit . <end>$$When he had uttered these words , he proceeds beyond the fortifications , and rushes on that part of the enemy which appeared the thickest .
<start> Ne Vorenus quidem tum sese vallo continet , sed omnium veritus existi mationem subsequitur . <end>$$Nor does Vorenus remain within the rampart , but respecting the high opinion of all , follows close after .
<start> Mediocri spatio relicto Pullo pilum in hostes immittit atque unum ex multitudine procurrentem traicit ; quo percusso et exanimato hunc scutis protegunt , in hostem tela universi coniciunt neque dant regrediendi facultatem . <end>$$Then , when an inconsiderable space intervened , Pullo throws his javelin at the enemy , and pierces one of the multitude who was running up , and while the latter was wounded and slain , the enemy cover him with their shields , and all throw their weapons at the other and afford him no opportunity of retreating .
<start> Transfigitur scutum Pulloni et verutum in balteo defigitur . <end>$$The shield of Pullo is pierced and a javelin is fastened in his belt .
<start> Avertit hic casus vaginam et gladium educere conanti dextram moratur manum , impeditumque hostes circumsistunt . <end>$$This circumstance turns aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting to draw his sword : the enemy crowd around him when embarrassed .
<start> Succurrit inimicus illi Vorenus et laboranti subvenit . <end>$$His rival runs up to him and succors him in this emergency .
<start> Ad hunc se confestim a Pullone omnis multitudo convertit : illum veruto arbitrantur occisum . <end>$$Immediately the whole host turn from Pullo to him , supposing the other to be pierced through by the javelin .
<start> Gladio comminus rem gerit Vorenus atque uno interfecto reliquos paulum propellit ; dum cupidius instat , in locum deiectus inferiorem concidit . <end>$$Vorenus rushes on briskly with his sword and carries on the combat hand to hand , and having slain one man , for a short time drove back the rest : while he urges on too eagerly , slipping into a hollow , he fell .
<start> Huic rursus circumvento fert subsidium Pullo , atque ambo incolumes compluribus interfectis summa cum laude sese intra munitiones recipiunt . <end>$$To him , in his turn , when surrounded , Pullo brings relief ; and both having slain a great number , retreat into the fortifications amid the highest applause .
<start> Sic fortuna in contentione et certamine utrumque versavit , ut alter alteri inimicus auxilio salutique esset , neque diiudicari posset , uter utri virtute anteferendus videretur . <end>$$Fortune so dealt with both in this rivalry and conflict , that the one competitor was a succor and a safeguard to the other , nor could it be determined which of the two appeared worthy of being preferred to the other .
<start> Quanto erat in dies gravior atque asperior oppugnatio , et maxime quod magna parte militum confecta vulneribus res ad paucitatem defensorum pervenerat , tanto crebriores litterae nuntiique ad Caesarem mittebantur ; quorum pars deprehensa in conspectu nostrorum militum cum cruciatu necabatur . <end>$$In proportion as the attack became daily more formidable and violent , and particularly , because , as a great number of the soldiers were exhausted with wounds , the matter had come to a small number of defenders , more frequent letters and messages were sent to Caesar ; a part of which messengers were taken and tortured to death in the sight of our soldiers .
<start> Erat unus intus Nervius nomine Vertico , loco natus honesto , qui a prima obsidione ad Ciceronem perfugerat suamque ei fidem praestiterat . <end>$$There was within our camp a certain Nervian , by name Vertico , born in a distinguished position , who in the beginning of the blockade had deserted to Cicero , and had exhibited his fidelity to him .
<start> Hic servo spe libertatis magnisque persuadet praemiis , ut litteras ad Caesarem deferat . <end>$$He persuades his slave , by the hope of freedom , and by great rewards , to convey a letter to Caesar .
<start> Has ille in iaculo illigatas effert et Gallus inter Gallos sine ulla suspicione versatus ad Caesarem pervenit . <end>$$This he carries out bound about his javelin ; and mixing among the Gauls without any suspicion by being a Gaul , he reaches Caesar .
<start> Ab eo de periculis Ciceronis legionisque cognoscitur . <end>$$From him they received information of the imminent danger of Cicero and the legion .
<start> Caesar acceptis litteris hora circiter Xl diei statim nuntium in Bellovacos ad Marcus Crassum quaestorem mittit , cuius hiberna aberant ab eo milia passuum XXV ; iubet media nocte legionem proficisci celeriterque ad se venire . <end>$$Caesar having received the letter about the eleventh hour of the day , immediately sends a messenger to the Bellovaci , to M .
<start> Scribit Labieno , si rei publicae commodo facere posset , cum legione ad fines Nerviorum veniat . <end>$$Fabius , the lieutenant , ordering him to lead forth his legion into the territories of the Atrebates , to which he knew his march must be made .
<start> Hora circiter tertia ab antecursoribus de Crassi adventu certior factus eo die milia passuum XX procedit . <end>$$Having been apprised of the arrival of Crassus by the scouts at about the third hour , he advances twenty miles that day .
<start> Crassum Samarobrivae praeficit legionemque attribuit , quod ibi impedimenta exercitus , obsides civitatum , litteras publicas frumentumque omne quod eo tolerandae hiemis causa devexerat relinquebat . <end>$$He appoints Crassus over Samarobriva and assigns him a legion , because he was leaving there the baggage of the army , the hostages of the states , the public documents , and all the corn , which he had conveyed thither for passing the winter .
<start> Fabius , ut imperatum erat , non ita multum moratus in itinere cum legione occurrit . <end>$$Fabius , without delaying a moment , meets him on the march with his legion , as he had been commanded .
<start> Labienus interitu Sabini et caede cohortium cognita , cum omnes ad eum Treverorum copiae venissent , veritus , si ex hibernis fugae similem profectionem fecisset , ut hostium impetum sustinere posset , praesertim quos recenti victoria efferri sciret , litteras Caesari remittit , quanto cum periculo legionem ex hibernis educturus esset ; rem gestam in Eburonibus perscribit ; docet omnes equitatus peditatusque copias Treverorum tria milia passuum longe ab suis castris consedisse . <end>$$Labienus , having learned the death of Sabinus and the destruction of the cohorts , as all the forces of the Treviri had come against him , beginning to fear lest , if he made a departure from his winter-quarters , resembling a flight , he should not be able to support the attack of the enemy , particularly since he knew them to be elated by their recent victory , sends back a letter to Caesar , informing him with what great hazard he would lead out his legion from winter-quarters ; he relates at large the affairs which had taken place among the Eburones ; he informs him that all the infantry and cavalry of the Treviri had encamped at a distance of only three miles from his own camp .
<start> Caesar consilio eius probato , etsi opinione trium legionum deiectus ad duas redierat , tamen unum communis salutis auxilium in celeritate ponebat . <end>$$Caesar , approving of his motives , although he was disappointed in his expectation of three legions , and reduced to two , yet placed his only hopes of the common safety in dispatch .
<start> Venit magnis itineribus in Nerviorum fines . <end>$$He goes into the territories of the Nervii by long marches .
<start> Ibi ex captivis cognoscit , quae apud Ciceronem gerantur , quantoque in periculo res sit . <end>$$There he learns from some prisoners what things are going on in the camp of Cicero , and in how great jeopardy the affair is .
<start> Tum cuidam ex equitibus Gallis magnis praemiis persuadet uti ad Ciceronem epistolam deferat . <end>$$Then with great rewards he induces a certain man of the Gallic horse to convey a letter to Cicero .
<start> Hanc Graecis conscriptam litteris mittit , ne intercepta epistola nostra ab hostibus consilia cognoscantur . <end>$$This he sends written in Greek characters , lest the letter being intercepted , our measures should be discovered by the enemy .
<start> Si adire non possit , monet ut tragulam cum epistola ad amentum deligata intra munitionem castrorum abiciat . <end>$$He directs him , if he should be unable to enter , to throw his spear with the letter fastened to the thong , inside the fortifications of the camp .
<start> In litteris scribit se cum legionibus profectum celeriter adfore ; hortatur ut pristinam virtutem retineat . <end>$$He writes in the letter , that he having set out with his legions , will quickly be there : he entreats him to maintain his ancient valor .
<start> Gallus periculum veritus , ut erat praeceptum , tragulam mittit . <end>$$The Gaul apprehending danger , throws his spear as he has been directed .
<start> Haec casu ad turrim adhaesit neque ab nostris biduo animadversa tertio die a quodam milite conspicitur , dempta ad Ciceronem defertur . <end>$$Is by chance stuck in a tower , and , not being observed by our men for two days , was seen by a certain soldier on the third day : when taken down , it was carried to Cicero .
<start> Ille perlectam in conventu militum recitat maximaque omnes laetitia adficit . <end>$$He , after perusing it , reads it out in an assembly of the soldiers , and fills all with the greatest joy .
<start> Tum fumi incendiorum procul videbantur ; quae res omnem dubitationem adventus legionum expulit . <end>$$Then the smoke of the fires was seen in the distance , a circumstance which banished all doubt of the arrival of the legions .
<start> Galli re cognita per exploratores obsidionem relinquunt , ad Caesarem omnibus copiis contendunt . <end>$$The Gauls , having discovered the matter through their scouts , abandon the blockade , and march toward Caesar with all their forces ; these were about 60 , 000 armed men .
<start> Cicero data facultate Gallum ab eodem Verticone , quem supra demonstravimus , repetit , qui litteras ad Caesarem deferat ; hunc admonet , iter caute diligenterque faciat : perscribit in litteris hostes ab se discessisse omnemque ad eum multitudinem convertisse . <end>$$When this letter was brought to him about the middle of the night , Caesar apprises his soldiers of its contents , and inspires them with courage for fighting : the following day , at the dawn , he moves his camp , and , having proceeded four miles , he espies the forces of the enemy on the other side of a considerable valley and rivulet .
<start> Quibus litteris circiter media nocte Caesar adlatis suos facit certiores eosque ad dimicandum animo confirmat . <end>$$It was an affair of great danger to fight with such large forces in a disadvantageous situation .
<start> Postero die luce prima movet castra et circiter milia passuum quattuor progressus trans vallem et rivum multitudinem hostium conspicatur . <end>$$For the present , therefore , inasmuch as he knew that Cicero was released from the blockade , and thought that he might , on that account , relax his speed , he halted there and fortifies a camp in the most favorable position he can .
<start> Erat magni periculi res tantulis copiis iniquo loco dimicare ; tum , quoniam obsidione liberatum Ciceronem sciebat , aequo animo remittendum de celeritate existimabat : consedit et quam aequissimo loco potest castra communit atque haec , etsi erant exigua per se vix hominum milium septem praesertim nullis cum impedimentis , tamen angustiis viarum quam maxime potest contrahit , eo consilio , ut in summam contemptionem hostibus veniat . <end>$$And this , though it was small in itself , scarcely 7 , 000 men , and these too without baggage , still by the narrowness of the passages , he contracts as much as he can , with this object , that he may come into the greatest contempt with the enemy .
<start> Interim speculatoribus in omnes partes dimissis explorat quo commodissime itinere vallem transire possit . <end>$$In the mean while scouts having been sent in all directions , he examines by what most convenient path he might cross the valley .
<start> Eo die parvulis equestribus proeliis ad aquam factis utrique sese suo loco continent : Galli , quod ampliores copias , quae nondum convenerant , exspectabant ; Caesar , si forte timoris simulatione hostes in suum locum elicere posset , ut citra vallem pro castris proelio contenderet , si id efficere non posset , ut exploratis itineribus minore cum periculo vallem rivumque transiret . <end>$$That day , slight skirmishes of cavalry having taken place near the river , both armies kept in their own positions : the Gauls , because they were awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived ; Caesar , if perchance by pretense of fear he could allure the enemy toward his position , so that he might engage in battle , in front of his camp , on this side of the valley ; if he could not accomplish this , that , having inquired about the passes , he might cross the valley and the river with the less hazard .
<start> Prima luce hostium equitatus ad castra accedit proeliumque cum nostris equitibus committit . <end>$$At daybreak the cavalry of the enemy approaches to the camp and joins battle with our horse .
<start> Caesar consulto equites cedere seque in castra recipere iubet , simul ex omnibus partibus castra altiore vallo muniri portasque obstrui atque in his administrandis rebus quam maxime concursari et cum simulatione agi timoris iubet . <end>$$Caesar orders the horse to give way purposely , and retreat to the camp : at the same time he orders the camp to be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions , the gates to be barricaded , and in executing these things as much confusion to be shown as possible , and to perform them under the pretense of fear .
<start> Quibus omnibus rebus hostes invitati copias traducunt aciemque iniquo loco constituunt , nostris vero etiam de vallo deductis propius accedunt et tela intra munitionem ex omnibus partibus coniciunt praeconibusque circummissis pronuntiari iubent , seu quis Gallus seu Romanus velit ante horam tertiam ad se transire , sine periculo licere ; post id tempus non fore potestatem : ac sic nostros contempserunt , ut obstructis in speciem portis singulis ordinibus caespitum , quod ea non posse introrumpere videbantur , alii vallum manu scindere , alii fossas complere inciperent . <end>$$Induced by all these things , the enemy lead over their forces and draw up their line in a disadvantageous position ; and as our men also had been led down from the ramparts , they approach nearer , and throw their weapons into the fortification from all sides , and sending heralds round , order it to be proclaimed that , if any , either Gaul or Roman , was willing to go over to them before the third hour , it was permitted ; after that time there would not be permission ; and so much did they disregard our men , that the gates having been blocked up with single rows of turf as a mere appearance , because they did not seem able to burst in that way , some began to pull down the rampart with their hands , others to fill up the trenches .
<start> Tum Caesar omnibus portis eruptione facta equitatuque emisso celeriter hostes in fugam dat , sic uti omnino pugnandi causa resisteret nemo , magnumque ex eis numerum occidit atque omnes armis exuit . <end>$$Then Caesar , making a sally from all the gates , and sending out the cavalry , soon puts the enemy to flight , so that no one at all stood his ground with the intention of fighting ; and he slew a great number of them , and deprived all of their arms .
<start> Longius prosequi veritus , quod silvae paludesque intercedebant neque etiam parvulo detrimento illorum locum relinqui videbat , omnibus suis incolumibus copiis eodem die ad Ciceronem pervenit . <end>$$Caesar , fearing to pursue them very far , because woods and morasses intervened , and also he saw that they suffered no small loss in abandoning their position , reaches Cicero the same day with all his forces safe .
<start> Institutas turres , testudines munitionesque hostium admiratur ; legione producta cognoscit non decimum quemque esse reliquum militem sine vulnere : ex his omnibus iudicat rebus , quanto cum periculo et quanta cum virtute res sint administratae . <end>$$He witnesses with surprise the towers , mantelets , and fortifications belonging to the enemy : the legion having been drawn out , he finds that even every tenth soldier had not escaped without wounds .
<start> Ciceronem pro eius merito leg , ionemque collaudat ; centuriones singillatim tribunosquc militum appellat , quorum egregiam fuisse virtutem testimonio Ciceronis cognoverat . <end>$$From all these things he judges with what danger and with what great courage matters had been conducted ; he commends Cicero according to his desert , and likewise the legion ; he addresses individually the centurions and the tribunes of the soldiers , whose valor he had discovered to have been signal .
<start> De casu Sabini et Cottae certius ex captivis cognoscit . <end>$$He receives information of the death of Sabinus and Cotta from the prisoners .
<start> Postero die contione habita rem gestam proponit , milites consolatur et confirmat : quod detrimentum culpa et temeritate legati sit acceptum , hoc aequiore animo ferendum docet , quod beneficio deorum immortalium et virtute eorum expiato incommodo neque hostibus diutina laetatio neque ipsis longior dolor relinquatur . <end>$$An assembly being held the following day , he states the occurrence ; he consoles and encourages the soldiers ; he suggests , that the disaster , which had been occasioned by the misconduct and rashness of his lieutenant , should be borne with a patient mind , because by the favor of the immortal gods and their own valor , neither was lasting joy left to the enemy , nor very lasting grief to them .
<start> Interim ad Labienum per Remos incredibili celeritate de victoria Caesaris fama perfertur , ut , cum ab hibernis Ciceronis milia passuum abesset circiter LX , eoque post horam nonam diei Caesar pervenisset , ante mediam noctem ad portas castrorum clamor oreretur , quo clamore significatio victoriae gratulatioque ab Remis Labieno fieret . <end>$$In the mean while the report respecting the victory of Caesar is conveyed to Labienus through the country of the Remi with incredible speed , so that , though he was about sixty miles distant from the winter-quarter of Cicero , and Caesar had arrived there after the ninth hour , before midnight a shout arose at the gates of the camp , by which shout an indication of the victory and a congratulation on the part of the Remi were given to Labienus .
<start> Hac fama ad Treveros perlata Indutiomarus , qui postero die castra Labieni oppugnare decreverat , noctu profugit copiasque omnes in Treveros reducit . <end>$$This report having been carried to the Treviri , Indutiomarus , who had resolved to attack the camp of Labienus the following day , flies by night and leads back all his forces into the country of the Treviri .
<start> Caesar Fabium cum sua legione remittit in hiberna , ipse cum tribus legionibus circum Samarobrivam trinis hibernis hiemare constituit et , quod tanti motus Galliae exstiterant , totam hiemem ipse ad exercitum manere decrevit . <end>$$Caesar sends back Fabius with his legion to his winter-quarters ; he himself determines to winter with three legions near Samarobriva in three different quarters , and , because such great commotions had arisen in Gaul , he resolved to remain during the whole winter with the army himself .
<start> Nam illo incommodo de Sabini morte perlato omnes fere Galliae civitates de bello consultabant , nuntios legationesque in omnes partes dimittebant et quid reliqui consili caperent atque unde initium belli fieret explorabant nocturnaque in locis desertis concilia habebant . <end>$$For the disaster respecting the death of Sabinus having been circulated among them , almost all the states of Gaul were deliberating about war , sending messengers and embassies into all quarters , inquiring what further measure they should take , and holding councils by night in secluded places .
<start> Neque ullum fere totius hiemis tempus sine sollicitudine Caesaris intercessit , quin aliquem de consiliis ac motu Gallorum nuntium acciperet . <end>$$Nor did any period of the whole winter pass over without fresh anxiety to Caesar , or , without his receiving some intelligence respecting the meetings and commotions of the Gauls .
<start> In his ab Lucio Roscio , quem legioni tertiae decimae praefecerat , certior factus est magnas Gallorum copias earum civitatum , quae Armoricae appellantur , oppugnandi sui causa convenisse neque longius milia passuum octo ab hibernis suis afuisse , sed nuntio allato de victoria Caesaris discessisse , adeo ut fugae similis discessus videretur . <end>$$Among these , he is informed by L Roscius , the lieutenant whom he had placed over the thirteenth legion , that large forces of those states of the Gauls , which are called the Armoricae , had assembled for the purpose of attacking him and were not more than eight miles distant ; but intelligence respecting the victory of Caesar being carried , had retreated in such a manner that their departure appeared like a flight .
<start> At Caesar principibus cuiusque civitatis ad se evocatis alias territando , cum se scire quae fierent denuntiaret , alias cohortando magnam partem Galliae in offiicio tenuit . <end>$$But Caesar , having summoned to him the principal persons of each state , in one case by alarming them , since he declared that he knew what was going on , and in another case by encouraging them , retained a great part of Gaul in its allegiance .
<start> Tamen Senones , quae est civitas in primis firma et magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis , Cavarinum , quem Caesar apud eos regem constituerat , cuius frater Moritasgus adventu in Galliam Caesaris cuiusque maiores regnum obtinuerant , interficere publico consilio conati , cum ille praesensisset ac profugisset , usque ad fines insecuti regno domoque expulerunt et , missis ad Caesarem satisfaciendi causa legatis , cum is omnem ad se senatum venire iussisset , dicto audientes non fuerunt . <end>$$The Senones , however , which is a state eminently powerful and one of great influence among the Gauls , attempting by general design to slay Cavarinus , whom Caesar had created king among them , when he discovered their plot and fled , pursued him even to the frontiers , and drove him from his kingdom and his home ; and , after having sent embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of concluding a peace , when he ordered all their senate to come to him , did not obey that command .
<start> Tantum apud homines barbaros valuit esse aliquos repertos principes inferendi belli tantamque omnibus voluntatum commutationem attulit , ut praeter Aeduos et Remos , quos praecipuo semper honore Caesar habuit , alteros pro vetere ac perpetua erga populum Romanum fide , alteros pro recentibus Gallici belli officiis , nulla fere civitas fuerit non suspecta nobis . <end>$$So far did it operate among those barbarian people , that there were found some to be the first to wage war ; and so great a change of inclinations did it produce in all , that , except the Aedui and the Remi , whom Caesar had always held in especial honor , the one people for their long standing and uniform fidelity toward the Roman people , the other for their late service in the Gallic war , there was scarcely a state which was not suspected by us .
<start> Idque adeo haud scio mirandumne sit , cum compluribus aliis de causis , tum maxime quod ei , qui virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur , tantum se eius opinionis deperdidisse ut a populo Romano imperia perferrent gravissime dolebant . <end>$$And I do not know whether that ought much to be wondered at , as well for several other reasons , as particularly because they who ranked above all nations for prowess in war , most keenly regretted that they had lost so much of that reputation as to submit to commands from the Roman people .
<start> Treveri vero atque Indutiomarus totius hiemis nullum tempus intermiserunt , quin trans Rhenum legatos mitterent , civitates sollicitarent , pecunias pollicerentur , magna parte exercitus nostri interfecta multo minorem superesse dicerent partem . <end>$$But the Triviri and Indutiomarus let no part of the entire winter pass without sending embassadors across the Rhine , importuning the states , promising money , and asserting that , as a large portion of our army had been cut off , a much smaller portion remained .
<start> Neque tamen ulli civitati Germanorum persuaderi potuit , ut Rhenum transiret , cum se bis expertos dicerent , Ariovisti bello et Tencterorum transitu : non esse amplius fortunam temptaturos . <end>$$However , none of the German States could be induced to cross the Rhine , since they had twice essayed it , they said , in the war with Ariovistus and in the passage of the Tenchtheri there ; that fortune was not to be tempted any more .
<start> Hac spe lapsus Indutiomarus nihilo minus copias cogere , exercere , a finitimis equos parare , exules damnatosque tota Gallia magnis praemiis ad se allicere coepit . <end>$$Indutiomarus disappointed in this expectation , nevertheless began to raise troops , and discipline them , and procure horses from the neighboring people , and allure to him by great rewards the outlaws and convicts throughout Gaul .
<start> Ac tantam sibi iam his rebus in Gallia auctoritatem comparaverat ut undique ad eum legationes concurrerent , gratiam atque amicitiam publice privatimque peterent . <end>$$And such great influence had he already acquired for himself in Gaul by these means , that embassies were flocking to him in all directions , and seeking , publicly and privately , his favor and friendship .
<start> Vbi intellexit ultro ad se veniri , altera ex parte Senones Carnutesque conscientia facinoris instigari , altera Nervios Aduatucosque bellum Romanis parare , neque sibi voluntariorum copias defore , si ex finibus suis progredi coepisset , armatum concilium indicit Hoc more Gallorum est initium belli , quo lege communi omnes puberes armati convenire consuerunt ; qui ex eis novissimus convenit , in conspectu multitudinis omnibus cruciatibus affectus necatur . <end>$$When he perceived that they were coming to him voluntarily ; that on the one side the Senones and the Carnutes were stimulated by their consciousness of guilt , on the other side the Nervii and the Aduatuci were preparing war against the Romans , and that forces of volunteers would not be wanting to him if he began to advance from his own territories , he proclaims an armed council at which , by a common law , all the youth were wont to assemble in arms , whoever of them comes last is killed in the sight of the whole assembly after being racked with every torture .
<start> His rebus confectis , in concilio pronuntiat arcessitum se a Senonibus et Carnutibus aliisque compluribus Galliae civitatibus ; huc iturum per fines Remorum eorumque agros popula turum ac , priusquam id faciat , castra Labieni oppugnaturum . <end>$$In that council he declares Cingetorix , the leader of the other faction , his own son-in-law an enemy and confiscates his property .
<start> Labienus , cum et loci natura et manu munitissumis castris sese teneret , de suo ac legionis periculo nihil timebat ; ne quam occasionem rei bene gerendae dimitteret , cogitabat . <end>$$Labienus , since he was confining himself within a camp strongly fortified by the nature of the ground and by art , had no apprehensions as to his own and the legion's danger , but was devising that he might throw away no opportunity of conducting the war successfully .
<start> Itaque a Cingetorige atque eius propinquis oratione Indutiomari cognita , quam in concilio habuerat , nuntios mittit ad finitimas civitates equitesque undique evocat : his certum diem conveniendi dicit . <end>$$Accordingly , the speech of Indutiomarus , which he had delivered in the council , having been made known by Cingetorix and his allies , he sends messengers to the neighboring states and summons horse from all quarters : he appoints to them a fixed day for assembling .
<start> Interim prope cotidie cum omni equitatu Indutiomarus sub castris eius vagabatur , alias ut situm castrorum cognosceret , alias colloquendi aut territandi causa : equites plerumque omnes tela intra vallum coniciebant . <end>$$In the mean time , Indutiomarus , with all his cavalry , nearly every day used to parade close to his camp ; at one time , that he might inform himself of the situation of the camp ; at another time , for the purpose of conferring with or of intimidating him .
<start> Labienus suos intra munitionem continebat timorisque opinionem , quibuscumque poterat rebus , augebat . <end>$$Labienus confined his men within the fortifications , and promoted the enemy's belief of his fear by whatever methods he could .
<start> Cum maiore in dies contemptione Indutiomarus ad castra accederet , nocte una intromissis equitibus omnium finitimarum civitatum quos arcessendos curaverat , tanta diligentia omnes suos custodiis intra castra continuit , ut nulla ratione ea res enuntiari aut ad Treveros perferri posset . <end>$$Since Indutiomarus was daily advancing up to the camp with greater defiance , all the cavalry of the neighboring states which he had taken care to have sent for , having been admitted in one night , he confined all his men within the camp by guards with such great strictness , that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to the Treviri .
<start> Interim ex consuetudine cotidiana Indutiomarus ad castra accedit atque ibi magnam partem diei consumit ; equites tela coniciunt et magna cum contumelia verborum nostros ad pugnam evocant . <end>$$In the mean while , Indutiomarus , according to his daily practice , advances up to the camp and spends a great part of the day there : his horse cast their weapons , and with very insulting language call out our men to battle .
<start> Comprobat hominis consilium fortuna , et cum unum omnes peterent , in ipso fluminis vado deprehensus Indutiomarus interficitur , caputque eius refertur in castra : redeuntes equites quos possunt consectantur atque occidunt . <end>$$The issue justifies the policy of the man , and since all aimed at one , Indutiomarus is slain , having been overtaken at the shawn ford of the river , and his head is carried to the camp , the horse , when returning , pursue and slay all whom they can .
<start> Hac re cognita omnes Eburonum et Nerviorum quae convenerant copiae discedunt , pauloque habuit post id factum Caesar quietiorem Galliam . <end>$$This affair having been known , all the forces of the Eburones and the Nervii which had assembled , depart ; and for a short time after this action , Caesar was less harassed in the government of Gaul .
<start> Multis de causis Caesar maiorem Galliae motum exspectans per Marcum Silanum , Gaium Antistium Reginum , Titum Sextium legatos delectum habere instituit ; simul ab Gnaeo Pompeio proconsule petit , quoniam ipse ad urbem cum imperio rei publicae causa remaneret , quos ex Cisalpina Gallia consulis sacramento rogavisset , ad signa convenire et ad se proficisci iuberet , magni interesse etiam in reliquum tempus ad opinionem Galliae existimans tantas videri Italiae facultates ut , si quid esset in bello detrimenti acceptum , non modo id brevi tempore sarciri , sed etiam maioribus augeri copiis posset . <end>$$Caesar , expecting for many reasons a greater commotion in Gaul , resolves to hold a levy by the means of M Silanus C Antistius Reginus , and T Sextius , his lieutenants : at the same time he requested Cn Pompey , the proconsul , that since he was remaining near the city invested with military command for the interests of the commonwealth , he would command those men whom when consul he had levied by the military oath in Cisalpine Gaul , to join their respective corps , and to proceed to him ; thinking it of great importance , as far as regarded the opinion which the Gauls would entertain for the future , that that the resources of Italy should appear so great that if any loss should be sustained in war , not only could it be repaired in a short time , but likewise be further supplied by still larger forces .
<start> Interfecto Indutiomaro , ut docuimus , ad eius propinquos a Treveris imperium defertur . <end>$$Indutiomarus having been slain , as we have stated , the government was conferred upon his relatives by the Treviri .
<start> Illi finitimos Germanos sollicitare et pecuniam polliceri non desistunt Cum ab proximis impetrare non possent , ulteriores temptant . <end>$$They cease not to importune the neighboring Germans and to promise them money : when they could not obtain from those nearest them , they try those more remote .
<start> Inventis nonnullis civitatibus iureiurando inter se confirmant obsidibusque de pecunia cavent : Ambiorigem sibi societate et foedere adiungunt . <end>$$Having found some states willing to accede to their wishes , they enter into a compact with them by a mutual oath , and give hostages as a security for the money : they attach Ambiorix to them by an alliance and confederacy .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar , cum undique bellum parari videret , Nervios , Aduatucos ac Menapios adiunctis Cisrhenanis omnibus Germanis esse in armis , Senones ad imperatum non venire et cum Carnutibus finitimisque civitatibus consilia communicare , a Treveris Germanos crebris legationibus sollicitari , maturius sibi de bello cogitandum putavit . <end>$$Caesar , on being informed of their acts , since he saw that war was being prepared on all sides , that the Nervii , Aduatuci , and Menapii , with the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine were under arms , that the Senones did not assemble according to his command , and were concerting measures with the Carnutes and the neighboring states , that the Germans were importuned by the Treviri in frequent embassies , thought that he ought to take measures for the war earlier  .
<start> Itaque nondum hieme confecta proximis quattuor coactis legionibus de improviso in fines Nerviorum contendit et , priusquam illi aut convenire aut profugere possent , magno pecoris atque hominum numero capto atque ea praeda militibus concessa vastatisque agris in deditionem venire atque obsides sibi dare coegit . <end>$$Accordingly , while the winter was not yet ended , having concentrated the four nearest legions , he marched unexpectedly into the territories of the Nervii , and before they could either assemble or retreat , after capturing a large number of cattle and of men , and wasting their lands and giving up that booty to the soldiers , compelled them to enter into a surrender and give him hostages .
<start> Eo celeriter confecto negotio rursus in hiberna legiones reduxit . <end>$$That business having been speedily executed , he again led his legions back into winter-quarters .
<start> Concilio Galliae primo vere , ut instituerat , indicto , cum reliqui praeter Senones , Carnutes Treverosque venissent , initium belli ac defectionis hoc esse arbitratus , ut omnia postponere videretur , concilium Lutetiam Parisiorum transfert . <end>$$Having proclaimed a council of Gaul in the beginning of the spring , as he had been accustomed , when the deputies from the rest , except the Senones , the Carnutes , and the Treviri , had come , judging this to be the commencement of war and revolt , that he might appear to consider all things of less consequence , he transfers the council to Lutetia of the Parisii .
<start> Confines erant hi Senonibus civitatemque patrum memoria coniunxerant , sed ab hoc consilio afuisse esistimabantur . <end>$$These were adjacent to the Senones , and had united their state to them during the memory of their fathers , but were thought to have no part in the present plot .
<start> Hac re pro suggestu pronuntiata eodem die cum legionibus in Senones proficiscitur magnisque itineribus eo pervenit . <end>$$Having proclaimed this from the tribunal , he advances the same day toward the Senones with his legions , and arrives among them by long marches .
<start> Cognito eius adventu Acco , qui princeps eius consili fuerat , iubet in oppida multitudinem convenire Conantibus , priusquam id effici posset , adesse Romanos nuntiatur Necessario sententia desistunt legatosque deprecandi causa ad Caesarem mittunt : adeunt per Aeduos , quorum antiquitus erat in fide civitas . <end>$$Acco , who had been the author of that enterprise , on being informed of his arrival , orders the people to assemble in the towns ; to them , while attempting this , and before it could be accomplished , news is brought that the Romans are close at hand : through necessity they give over their design and send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of imploring pardon ; they make advances to him through the Aedui , whose state was from ancient times under the protection of Rome .
<start> Libenter Caesar petentibus Aeduis dat veniam excusationemque accipit , quod aestivum tempus instantis belli , non quaestionis esse arbitrabatur . <end>$$Caesar readily grants them pardon , and receives their excuse , at the request of the Aedui , because he thought that the summer season was one for an impending war , not for an investigation .
<start> Obsidibus imperatis centum hos Aeduis custodiendos tradit . <end>$$Having imposed one hundred hostages , he delivers these to the Aedui to be held in charge by them .
<start> Eodem Carnutes legatos obsidesque mittunt usi deprecatoribus Renis , quorum erant in clientela : eadem ferunt responsa . <end>$$To the same place the Carnutes send embassadors and hostages , employing as their mediators the Remi , under whose protection they were : they receive the same answers .
<start> Peragit concilium Caesar equitesque imperat civitatibus . <end>$$Caesar concludes the council and imposes a levy of cavalry on the states .
<start> Hac parte Galliae pacata totus et mente et animo in bellum Treverorum et Ambiorigis insistit . <end>$$This part of Gaul having been tranquilized , he applies himself entirely both in mind and soul to the war with the Treviri and Ambiorix .
<start> Cavarinum cum equitatu Senonum secum proficisci iubet , ne quis aut ex huius iracundia aut ex eo , quod meruerat , odio civitatis motus exsistat . <end>$$He orders Cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of the Senones , lest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper , or out of the hatred of the state which he had incurred .
<start> His rebus constitutis , quod pro explorato habebat Ambiorigem proelio non esse concertaturum , reliqua eius consilia animo circumspiciebat . <end>$$After arranging these things , as he considered it certain that Ambiorix would not contend in battle , he watched his other plans attentively .
<start> Erant Menapii propinqui Eburonum finibus , perpetuis paludibus silvisque muniti , qui uni ex Gallia de pace ad Caesarem legatos numquam miserant . <end>$$The Menapii bordered on the territories of the Eburones , and were protected by one continued extent of morasses and woods ; and they alone out of Gaul had never sent embassadors to Caesar on the subject of peace .
<start> Cum his esse hospitium Ambiorigi sciebat ; item per Treveros venisse Germanis in amicitiam cognoverat . <end>$$Caesar knew that a tie of hospitality subsisted between them and Ambiorix : he also discovered that the latter had entered into an alliance with the Germans by means of the Treviri .
<start> Haec prius illi detrahenda auxilia existimabat quam ipsum bello lacesseret , ne desperata salute aut se in Menapios abderet aut cum Transrhenanis congredi cogeretur . <end>$$Ho thought that these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him before he provoked him to war ; lest he , despairing of safety , should either proceed to conceal himself in the territories of the Menapii , or should be driven to coalesce with the Germans beyond the Rhine .
<start> Hoc inito consilio totius exercitus impedimenta ad Labienum in Treveros mittit duasque legiones ad eum proficisci iubet ; ipse cum legionibus expeditis quinque in Menapios proficiscitur . <end>$$Having entered upon this resolution , he sends the baggage of the whole army to Labienus , in the territories of the Treviri and orders two legions to proceed to him : he himself proceeds against the Menapii with five lightly-equipped legions .
<start> Illi nulla coacta manu loci praesidio freti in silvas paludesque confugiunt suaque eodem conferunt . <end>$$They , having assembled no troops , as they relied on the defense of their position , retreat into the woods and morasses , and convey thither all their property .
<start> Caesar partitis copiis cum Gaio Fabio legato et Marco Crasso quaestore celeriterque effectis pontibus adit tripertito , aedificia vicosque incendit , magno pecoris atque hominum numero potitur . <end>$$Caesar , having divided his forces with C Fabius , his lieutenant , and M Crassus his questor , and having hastily constructed some bridges , enters their country in three divisions , burns their houses and villages , and gets possession of a large number of cattle and men .
<start> Quibus rebus coacti Menapii legatos ad eum pacis petendae causa mittunt . <end>$$Constrained by these circumstances the Menapii send embassadors to him for the purpose of suing for peace .
<start> Ille obsidibus acceptis hostium se habiturum numero confirmat , si aut Ambiorigem aut eius legatos finibus suis recepissent . <end>$$He , after receiving hostages , assures them that he will consider them in the number of his enemies if they shall receive within their territories either Ambiorix or his embassadors .
<start> His confirmatis rebus Commium Atrebatem cum equitatu custodis loco in Menapiis relinquit ; ipse in Treveros proficiscitur . <end>$$Having determinately settled these things , he left among the Menapii , Commius the Atrebatian , with some cavalry as a guard ; he himself proceeds toward the Treviri .
<start> Dum haec a Caesare geruntur , Treveri magnis coactis peditatus equitatusque copiis Labienum cum una legione , quae in eorum finibus hiemaverat , adoriri parabant , iamque ab eo non longius bidui via aberant , cum duas venisse legiones missu Caesaris cognoscunt . <end>$$While these things are being performed by Caesar , the Treviri , having drawn together large forces of infantry and cavalry , were preparing to attack Labienus and the legion which was wintering in their territories , and were already not further distant from him than a journey of two days , when they learn that two legions had arrived by the order of Caesar .
<start> Positis castris a milibus passuum XV auxilia Germanorum esspectare constituunt . <end>$$Having pitched their camp fifteen miles off , they resolve to await the support of the Germans .
<start> Labienus hostium cognito consilio sperans temeritate eorum fore aliquam dimicandi facultatem praesidio quinque cohortium impedimentis relicto cum viginti quinque cohortibus magnoque equitatu contra hostem proficiscitur et mille passuum intermisso spatio castra communit . <end>$$Labienus , having learned the design of the enemy , hoping that through their rashness there would be some opportunity of engaging , after leaving a guard of five cohorts for the baggage , advances against the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large body of cavalry , and , leaving the space of a mile between them , fortifies his camp .
<start> Erat inter Labienum atque hostem difficili transitu flumen ripisque praeruptis Hoc neque ipse transire habebat in animo neque hostes transituros existimabat . <end>$$There was between Labienus and the enemy a river difficult to cross , and with steep banks : this neither did he himself design to cross , nor did he suppose the enemy would cross it .
<start> Augebatur auxiliorum cotidie spes . <end>$$Their hope of auxiliaries was daily increasing .
<start> Loquitur in concilio palam , quoniam Germani appropinquare dicantur , sese suas exercitusque fortunas in dubium non devocaturum et postero die prima luce castra moturum . <end>$$He openly says in a council that since the Germans are said to be approaching , he would not bring into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes , and the next day would move his camp at early dawn .
<start> Celeriter haec ad hostes deferuntur , ut ex magno Gallorum equitum numero nonnullos Gallicis rebus favere natura cogebat . <end>$$These words are quickly carried to the enemy , since out of so large a number of cavalry composed of Gauls , nature compelled some to favor the Gallic interests .
<start> Labienus noctu tribunis militum primisque ordinibus convocatis , quid sui sit consili proponit et , quo facilius hostibus timoris det suspicionem , maiore strepitu et tumultu , quam populi Romani fert consuetudo castra moveri iubet . <end>$$Labienus , having assembled the tribunes of the soldiers and principal centurions by night , states what his design is , and , that he may the more easily give the enemy a belief of his fears , he orders the camp to be moved with greater noise and confusion than was usual with the Roman people .
<start> His rebus fugae similem profectionem effecit . <end>$$By these means he makes his departure like a retreat .
<start> Haec quoque per exploratores ante lucem in tanta propinquitate castrorum ad hostes deferuntur . <end>$$These things , also , since the camps were so near , are reported to the enemy by scouts before daylight .
<start> Vix agmen novissimum extra munitiones processerat , cum Galli cohortati inter se , ne speratam praedam ex manibus dimitterent--longum esse perterritis Romanis Germanorum auxilium exspectare , neque suam pati dignitatem ut tantis copiis tam exiguam manum praesertim fugientem atque impeditam adoriri non audeant--flumen transire et iniquo loco committere proelium non dubitant . <end>$$Scarcely had the rear advanced beyond the fortifications when the Gauls , encouraging one another not to cast from their hands the anticipated booty , that it was a tedious thing , while the Romans were panic-stricken , to be waiting for the aid of the Germans , and that their dignity did not suffer them to fear to attack with such great forces so small a band , particularly when retreating and encumbered , do not hesitate to cross the river and give battle in a disadvantageous position .
<start> Tum praemissis paulum impedimentis atque in tumulo quodam collocatis Habetis , inquit , milites , quam petistis facultatem : hostem impedito atque iniquo loco tenetis : praestate eandem nobis ducibus virtutem , quam saepe numero imperatori praestitistis , atque illum adesse et haec coram cernere existimate . <end>$$Labienus suspecting that these things would happen , was proceeding quietly , and using the same pretense of a march , in order that he might entice them across the river .
<start> Cum his propinqui Indutiomari , qui defectionis auctores fuerant , comitati eos ex civitate excesserunt . <end>$$The relations of Indutiomarus , who had been the promoters of the revolt , accompanying them , quitted their own state with them .
<start> Caesar , postquam ex Menapiis in Treveros venit , duabus de causis Rhenum transire constituit ; quarum una erat , quod auxilia contra se Treveris miserant , altera , ne ad eos Ambiorix receptum haberet . <end>$$Caesar , after he came from the territories of the Menapii into those of the Treviri , resolved for two reasons to cross the Rhine ; one of which was , because they had sent assistance to the Treviri against him ; the other , that Ambiorix might not have a retreat among them .
<start> His constitutis rebus paulum supra eum locum quo ante exercitum traduxerat facere pontem instituit . <end>$$Having determined on these matters , he began to build a bridge a little above that place where he had before conveyed over his army .
<start> Nota atque instituta ratione magno militum studio paucis diebus opus efficitur . <end>$$The plan having been known and laid down , the work is accomplished in a few days by the great exertion of the soldiers .
<start> Firmo in Treveris ad pontem praesidio relicto , ne quis ab his subito motus oreretur , reliquas copias equitatumque traducit . <end>$$Having left a strong guard at the bridge on the side of the Treviri , lest any commotion should suddenly arise among them , he leads over the rest of the forces and the cavalry .
<start> Vbii , qui ante obsides dederant atque in deditionem venerant , purgandi sui causa ad eum legatos mittunt , qui doceant neque auxilia ex sua civitate in Treveros missa neque ab se fidem laesam : petunt atque orant ut sibi parcat , ne communi odio Germanorum innocentes pro nocentibus poenas pendant ; si amplius obsidum vellet , dare pollicentur . <end>$$The Ubii , who before had sent hostages and come to a capitulation , send embassadors to him , for the purpose of vindicating themselves , to assure him that neither had auxiliaries been sent to the Treviri from their state , nor had they violated their allegiance ; they entreat and beseech him to spare them , lest , in his common hatred of the Germans , the innocent should suffer the penalty of the guilty : they promise to give more hostages , if he desire them .
<start> Cognita Caesar causa reperit ab Suebis auxilia missa esse ; Vbiorum satisfactionem accipit , aditus viasque in Suebos perquirit . <end>$$Having investigated the case , Caesar finds that the auxiliaries had been sent by the Suevi ; he accepts the apology of the Ubii , and makes the minute inquiries concerning the approaches and the routes to the territories of the Suevi .
<start> Interim paucis post diebus fit ab Vbiis certior Suebos omnes in unum locum copias cogere atque eis nationibus quae sub eorum sint imperio denuntiare , ut auxilia peditatus equitatusque mittant . <end>$$In the mean time he is informed by the Ubii , a few days after , that the Suevi are drawing all their forces into one place , and are giving orders to those nations which are under their government to send auxiliaries of infantry and of cavalry .
<start> His cognitis rebus rem frumentariam providet , castris idoneum locum deligit ; Vbiis imperat ut pecora deducant suaque omnia ex agris in oppida conferant , sperans barbaros atque imperitos homines inopia cibariorum adductos ad iniquam pugnandi condicionem posse deduci ; mandat , ut crebros exploratores in Suebos mittant quaeque apud eos gerantur cognoscant . <end>$$Having learned these things , he provides a supply of corn , selects a proper place for his camp , and commands the Ubii to drive off their cattle and carry away all their possessions from the country parts into the towns , hoping that they , being a barbarous and ignorant people , when harassed by the want of provisions , might be brought to an engagement on disadvantageous terms : he orders them to send numerous scouts among the Suevi , and learn what things are going on among them .
<start> Illi imperata faciunt et paucis diebus intermissis referunt : Suebos omnes , posteaquam certiores nuntii de exercitu Romanorum venerint , cum omnibus suis sociorumque copiis , quas coegissent , penitus ad extremos fines se recepisse : silvam esse ibi infinita magnitudine , quae appellatur Bacenis ; hanc longe introrsus pertinere et pro nativo muro obiectam Cheruscos ab Suebis Suebosque ab Cheruscis iniuriis incursionibusque prohibere : ad eius initium silvae Suebos adventum Romanorum exspectare constituisse . <end>$$They execute the orders , and , a few days having intervened , report that all the Suevi , after certain intelligence concerning the army of the Romans had come , retreated with all their own forces and those of their allies , which they had assembled , to the utmost extremities of their territories : that there is a wood there of very great extent , which is called Bacenis ; that this stretches a great way into the interior , and , being opposed as a natural barrier , defends from injuries and incursions the Cherusci against the Suevi , and the Suevi against the Cherusci : that at the entrance of that forest the Suevi had determined to await the coming up of the Romans .
<start> Quoniam ad hunc locum perventum est , non alienum esse videtur de Galliae Germaniaeque moribus et quo differant hae nationes inter sese proponere . <end>$$Since we have come to the place , it does not appear to be foreign to our subject to lay before the reader an account of the manners of Gaul and Germany , and wherein these nations differ from each other .
<start> In Gallia non solum in omnibus civitatibus atque in omnibus pagis partibusque , sed paene etiam in singulis domibus factiones sunt , earumque factionum principes sunt qui summam auctoritatem eorum iudicio habere existimantur , quorum ad arbitrium iudiciumque summa omnium rerum consiliorumque redeat . <end>$$In Gaul there are factions not only in all the states , and in all the cantons and their divisions , but almost in each family , and of these factions those are the leaders who are considered according to their judgment to possess the greatest influence , upon whose will and determination the management of all affairs and measures depends .
<start> Idque eius rei causa antiquitus institutum videtur , ne quis ex plebe contra potentiorem auxili egeret : suos enim quisque opprimi et circumveniri non patitur , neque , aliter si faciat , ullam inter suos habet auctoritatem . <end>$$And that seems to have been instituted in ancient times with this view , that no one of the common people should be in want of support against one more powerful ; for , none suffers his party to be oppressed and defrauded , and if he do otherwise , he has no influence among his party .
<start> Haec eadem ratio est in summa totius Galliae : namque omnes civitates in partes divisae sunt duas . <end>$$This same policy exists throughout the whole of Gaul ; for all the states are divided into two factions .
<start> Cum Caesar in Galliam venit , alterius factionis principes erant Aedui , alterius Sequani . <end>$$When Caesar arrived in Gaul , the Aedui were the leaders of one faction , the Sequani of the other .
<start> Hi cum per se minus valerent , quod summa auctoritas antiquitus erat in Aeduis magnaeque eorum erant clientelae , Germanos atque Ariovistum sibi adiunxerant eosque ad se magnis iacturis pollicitationibusque perduxerant . <end>$$Since the latter were less powerful by themselves , inasmuch as the chief influence was from of old among the Aedui , and their dependencies were great , they had united to themselves the Germans and Ariovistus , and had brought them over to their party by great sacrifices and promises .
<start> Proeliis vero compluribus factis secundis atque omni nobilitate Aeduorum interfecta tantum potentia antecesserant , ut magnam partem clientium ab Aeduis ad se traducerent obsidesque ab eis principum filios acciperent et publice iurare cogerent nihil se contra Sequanos consili inituros et partem finitimi agri per vim occupatam possiderent Galliaeque totius principatum obtinerent . <end>$$And having fought several successful battles and slain all the nobility of the Aedui , they had so far surpassed them in power , that they brought over , from the Aedui to themselves , a large portion of their dependents and received from them the sons of their leading men as hostages , and compelled them to swear in their public character that they would enter into no design against them ; and held a portion of the neighboring land , seized on by force , and possessed the sovereignty of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Qua necessitate adductus Diviciacus auxili petendi causa Romam ad senatum profectus infecta re redierat . <end>$$Divitiacus urged by this necessity , had proceeded to Rome to the senate , for the purpose of entreating assistance , and had returned without accomplishing his object .
<start> Adventu Caesaris facta commutatione rerum , obsidibus Aeduis redditis , veteribus clientelis restitutis , novis per Caesarem comparatis , quod hi , qui se ad eorum amicitiam adgregaverant , meliore condicione atque aequiore imperio se uti videbant , reliquis rebus eorum gratia dignitateque amplificata Sequani principatum dimiserant . <end>$$A change of affairs ensued on the arrival of Caesar , the hostages were returned to the Aedui , their old dependencies restored , and new acquired through Caesar , their other interests , their influence , their reputation were likewise increased , and in consequence , the Sequani lost the sovereignty .
<start> In eorum locum Remi successerant : quos quod adaequare apud Caesarem gratia intellegebatur , ei , qui propter veteres inimicitias nullo modo cum Aeduis coniungi poterant , se Remis in clientelam dicabant . <end>$$The Remi succeeded to their place , and , as it was perceived that they equaled the Aedui in favor with Caesar , those , who on account of their old animosities could by no means coalesce with the Aedui , consigned themselves in clientship to the Remi .
<start> Hos illi diligenter tuebantur : ita et novam et repente collectam auctoritatem tenebant . <end>$$The latter carefully protected them Thus they possessed both a new and suddenly acquired influence .
<start> Eo tum statu res erat , ut longe principes haberentur Aedui , secundum locum dignitatis Remi obtinerent . <end>$$Affairs were then in that position that the Aedui were considered by far the leading people , and the Remi held the second post of honor .
<start> In omni Gallia eorum hominum , qui aliquo sunt numero atque honore , genera sunt duo Nam plebes paene servorum habetur loco , quae nihil audet per se , nullo adhibetur consilio . <end>$$Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who are of any rank and dignity : for the commonality is held almost in the condition of slaves , and dares to undertake nothing of itself , and is admitted to no deliberation .
<start> Nobilibus in hos eadem omnia sunt iura , quae dominis in servos . <end>$$But of these two orders , one is that of the Druids , the other that of the knights .
<start> Sed de his duobus generibus alterum est druidum , alterum equitum . <end>$$The former are engaged in things sacred , conduct the public and the private sacrifices , and interpret all matters of religion .
<start> Illi rebus divinis intersunt , sacrificia publica ac privata procurant , religiones interpretantur : ad hos magnus adulescentium numerus disciplinae causa concurrit , magnoque hi sunt apud eos honore . <end>$$To these a large number of the young men resort for the purpose of instruction , and they are in great honor among them .
<start> Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt , et , si quod est admissum facinus , si caedes facta , si de hereditate , de finibus controversia est , idem decernunt , praemia poenasque constituunt ; si qui aut privatus aut populus eorum decreto non stetit , sacrificiis interdicunt . <end>$$For they determine respecting almost all controversies , public and private ; and if any crime has been perpetrated , if murder has been committed , if there be any dispute about an inheritance , if any about boundaries , these same persons decide it ; they decree rewards and punishments ; if any one , either in a private or public capacity , has not submitted to their decision , they interdict him from the sacrifices .
<start> Haec poena apud eos est gravissima . <end>$$This among them is the most heavy punishment .
<start> Quibus ita est interdictum , hi numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habentur , his omnes decedunt , aditum sermonemque defugiunt , ne quid ex contagione incommodi accipiant , neque his petentibus ius redditur neque honos ullus communicatur . <end>$$Those who have been thus interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the criminal : all shun them , and avoid their society and conversation , lest they receive some evil from their contact ; nor is justice administered to them when seeking it , nor is any dignity bestowed on them .
<start> His autem omnibus druidibus praeest unus , qui summam inter eos habet auctoritatem . <end>$$Over all these Druids one presides , who possesses supreme authority among them .
<start> Hoc mortuo aut si qui ex reliquis excellit dignitate succedit , aut , si sunt plures pares , suffragio druidum , nonnumquam etiam armis de principatu contendunt . <end>$$Upon his death , if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent in dignity , he succeeds ; but , if there are many equal , the election is made by the suffrages of the Druids ; sometimes they even contend for the presidency with arms .
<start> Hi certo anni tempore in finibus Carnutum , quae regio totius Galliae media habetur , considunt in loco consecrato . <end>$$These assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated place in the territories of the Carnutes , which is reckoned the central region of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Huc omnes undique , qui controversias habent , conveniunt eorumque decretis iudiciisque parent . <end>$$Hither all , who have disputes , assemble from every part , and submit to their decrees and determinations .
<start> Disciplina in Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur , et nunc , qui diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt , plerumque illo discendi causa proficiscuntur . <end>$$This institution is supposed to have been devised in Britain , and to have been brought over from it into Gaul ; and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying it .
<start> Druides a bello abesse consuerunt neque tributa una cum reliquis pendunt ; militiae vacationem omniumque rerum habent immunitatem . <end>$$The Druids do not go to war , nor pay tribute together with the rest ; they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in all matters .
<start> Tantis excitati praemiis et sua sponte multi in disciplinam conveniunt et a parentibus propinquisque mittuntur . <end>$$Induced by such great advantages , many embrace this profession of their own accord , and are sent to it by their parents and relations .
<start> Magnum ibi numerum versuum ediscere dicuntur Itaque annos nonnulli vicenos in disciplina permanent . <end>$$They are said there to learn by heart a great number of verses ; accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty years .
<start> Neque fas esse existimant ea litteris mandare , cum in reliquis fere rebus , publicis privatisque rationibus Graecis litteris utantur . <end>$$Nor do they regard it lawful to commit these to writing , though in almost all other matters , in their public and private transactions , they use Greek characters .
<start> Id mihi duabus de causis instituisse videntur , quod neque in vulgum disciplinam efferri velint neque eos , qui discunt , litteris confisos minus memoriae studere : quod fere plerisque accidit , ut praesidio litterarum diligentiam in perdiscendo ac memoriam remittant . <end>$$That practice they seem to me to have adopted for two reasons ; because they neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people , nor those who learn , to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory , relying on writing ; since it generally occurs to most men , that , in their dependence on writing , they relax their diligence in learning thoroughly , and their employment of the memory .
<start> In primis hoc volunt persuadere , non interire animas , sed ab aliis post mortem transire ad alios , atque hoc maxime ad virtutem excitari putant metu mortis neglecto . <end>$$They wish to inculcate this as one of their leading tenets , that souls do not become extinct , but pass after death from one body to another , and they think that men by this tenet are in a great degree excited to valor , the fear of death being disregarded .
<start> Multa praeterea de sideribus atque eorum motu , de mundi ac terrarum magnitudine , de rerum natura , de deorum immortalium vi ac potestate disputant et iuventuti tradunt . <end>$$They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many things respecting the stars and their motion , respecting the extent of the world and of our earth , respecting the nature of things , respecting the power and the majesty of the immortal gods .
<start> Alterum genus est equitum . <end>$$The other order is that of the knights .
<start> Hi , cum est usus atque aliquod bellum incidit (quod fere ante Caesaris adventum quotannis accidere solebat , uti aut ipsi iniurias inferrent aut illatas propulsarent) , omnes in bello versantur , atque eorum ut quisque est genere copiisque amplissimus , ita plurimos circum se ambactos clientesque habet . <end>$$These , when there is occasion and any war occurs , are all engaged in war And those of them most distinguished by birth and resources , have the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them .
<start> Hanc unam gratiam potentiamque noverunt . <end>$$They acknowledge this sort of influence and power only .
<start> Natio est omnis Gallorum admodum dedita religionibus , atque ob eam causam , qui sunt adfecti gravioribus morbis quique in proeliis periculisque versantur , aut pro victimis homines immolant aut se immolaturos vovent administrisque ad ea sacrificia druidibus utuntur , quod , pro vita hominis nisi hominis vita reddatur , non posse deorum immortalium numen placari arbitrantur , publiceque eiusdem generis habent instituta sacrificia . <end>$$The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious rites ; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe diseases , and they who are engaged in battles and dangers , either sacrifice men as victims , or vow that they will sacrifice them , and employ the Druids as the performers of those sacrifices ; because they think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man , the mind of the immortal gods can not be rendered propitious , and they have sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes .
<start> Alii immani magnitudine simulacra habent , quorum contexta viminibus membra vivis hominibus complent ; quibus succensis circumventi flamma exanimantur homines . <end>$$Others have figures of vast size , the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men , which being set on fire , the men perish enveloped in the flames .
<start> Supplicia eorum qui in furto aut in latrocinio aut aliqua noxia sint comprehensi gratiora dis immortalibus esse arbitrantur ; sed , cum eius generis copia defecit , etiam ad innocentium supplicia descendunt . <end>$$They consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft , or in robbery , or any other offense , is more acceptable to the immortal gods ; but when a supply of that class is wanting , they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent .
<start> Deum maxime Mercurium colunt Huius sunt plurima simulacra : hunc omnium inventorem artium ferunt , hunc viarum atque itinerum ducem , hunc ad quaestus pecuniae mercaturasque habere vim maximam arbitrantur . <end>$$They worship as their divinity , Mercury in particular , and have many images of him , and regard him as the inventor of all arts , they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches , and believe him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions .
<start> De his eandem fere , quam reliquae gentes , habent opinionem : Apollinem morbos depellere , Minervam operum atque artificiorum initia tradere , Iovem imperium caelestium tenere , Martem bella regere . <end>$$To him , when they have determined to engage in battle , they commonly vow those things which they shall take in war .
<start> Huic , cum proelio dimicare constituerunt , ea quae bello ceperint plerumque devovent : cum superaverunt , animalia capta immolant reliquasque res in unum locum conferunt . <end>$$When they have conquered , they sacrifice whatever captured animals may have survived the conflict , and collect the other things into one place .
<start> Multis in civitatibus harum rerum exstructos tumulos locis consecratis conspicari licet ; neque saepe accidit , ut neglecta quispiam religione aut capta apud se occultare aut posita tollere auderet , gravissimumque ei rei supplicium cum cruciatu constitutum est . <end>$$In many states you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated spots ; nor does it often happen that any one , disregarding the sanctity of the case , dares either to secrete in his house things captured , or take away those deposited ; and the most severe punishment , with torture , has been established for such a deed .
<start> Galli se omnes ab Dite patre prognatos praedicant idque ab druidibus proditum dicunt . <end>$$All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis , and say that this tradition has been handed down by the Druids .
<start> Ob eam causam spatia omnis temporis non numero dierum sed noctium finiunt ; dies natales et mensum et annorum initia sic observant ut noctem dies subsequatur . <end>$$For that reason they compute the divisions of every season , not by the number of days , but of nights ; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night .
<start> In reliquis vitae institutis hoc fere ab reliquis differunt , quod suos liberos , nisi cum adoleverunt , ut munus militiae sustinere possint , palam ad se adire non patiuntur filiumque puerili aetate in publico in conspectu patris adsistere turpe ducunt . <end>$$Among the other usages of their life , they differ in this from almost all other nations , that they do not permit their children to approach them openly until they are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war ; and they regard it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence of his father .
<start> Viri , quantas pecunias ab uxoribus dotis nomine acceperunt , tantas ex suis bonis aestimatione facta cum dotibus communicant . <end>$$Whatever sums of money the husbands have received in the name of dowry from their wives , making an estimate of it , they add the same amount out of their own estates .
<start> Huius omnis pecuniae coniunctim ratio habetur fructusque servantur : uter eorum vita superarit , ad eum pars utriusque cum fructibus superiorum temporum pervenit . <end>$$An account is kept of all this money conjointly , and the profits are laid by : whichever of them shall have survived , to that one the portion of both reverts together with the profits of the previous time .
<start> Viri in uxores , sicuti in liberos , vitae necisque habent potestatem ; et cum paterfamiliae illustriore loco natus decessit , eius propinqui conveniunt et , de morte si res in suspicionem venit , de uxoribus in servilem modum quaestionem habent et , si compertum est , igni atque omnibus tormentis excruciatas interficiunt . <end>$$Husbands have power of life and death over their wives as well as over their children : and when the father of a family , born in a more than commonly distinguished rank , has died , his relations assemble , and , if the circumstances of his death are suspicious , hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves ; and , if proof be obtained , put them to severe torture , and kill them .
<start> Funera sunt pro cultu Gallorum magnifica et sumptuosa ; omniaque quae vivis cordi fuisse arbitrantur in ignem inferunt , etiam animalia , ac paulo supra hanc memoriam servi et clientes , quos ab eis dilectos esse constabat , iustis funeribus confectis una cremabantur . <end>$$Their funerals , considering the state of civilization among the Gauls , are magnificent and costly ; and they cast into the fire all things , including living creatures , which they suppose to have been dear to them when alive ; and , a little before this period , slaves and dependents , who were ascertained to have been beloved by them , were , after the regular funeral rites were completed , burnt together with them .
<start> Quae civitates commodius suam rem publicam administrare existimantur , habent legibus sanctum , si quis quid de re publica a finitimis rumore aut fama acceperit , uti ad magistratum deferat neve cum quo alio communicet , quod saepe homines temerarios atque imperitos falsis rumoribus terreri et ad facinus impelli et de summis rebus consilium capere cognitum est . <end>$$Those states which are considered to conduct their commonwealth more judiciously , have it ordained by their laws , that , if any person shall have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any thing concerning the commonwealth , he shall convey it to the magistrate , and not impart it to any other ; because it has been discovered that inconsiderate and inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports , and driven to some rash act , or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance .
<start> Magistratus quae visa sunt occultant quaeque esse ex usu iudicaverunt multitudini produnt . <end>$$The magistrates conceal those things which require to be kept unknown ; and they disclose to the people whatever they determine to be expedient .
<start> De re publica nisi per concilium loqui non conceditur . <end>$$It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth , except in council .
<start> Germani multum ab hac consuetudine differunt Nam neque druides habent , qui rebus divinis praesint , neque sacrificiis student . <end>$$The Germans differ much from these usages , for they have neither Druids to preside over sacred offices , nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices .
<start> Deorum numero eos solos ducunt , quos cernunt et quorum aperte opibus iuvantur , Solem et Vulcanum et Lunam , reliquos ne fama quidem acceperunt . <end>$$They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold , and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited , namely , the sun , fire , and the moon ; they have not heard of the other deities even by report .
<start> Vita omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei militaris consistit : ab parvulis labori ac duritiae student . <end>$$Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art ; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships .
<start> Qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt , maximam inter suos ferunt laudem : hoc ali staturam , ali vires nervosque confirmari putant . <end>$$Those who have remained chaste for the longest time , receive the greatest commendation among their people ; they think that by this the growth is promoted , by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened .
<start> Intra annum vero vicesimum feminae notitiam habuisse in turpissimis habent rebus ; cuius rei nulla est occultatio , quod et promiscue in fluminibus perluuntur et pellibus aut parvis renonum tegimentis utuntur magna corporis parte nuda . <end>$$And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts ; of which matter there is no concealment , because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides , a large portion of the body being in consequence naked .
<start> Agriculturae non student , maiorque pars eorum victus in lacte , caseo , carne consistit Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet proprios ; sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos gentibus cognationibusque hominum , qui una coierunt , quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio transire cogunt . <end>$$They do not pay much attention to agriculture , and a large portion of their food consists in milk , cheese , and flesh ; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits ; but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families , who have united together , as much land as , and in the place in which , they think proper , and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere .
<start> Eius rei multas adferunt causas : ne adsidua consuetudine capti studium belli gerendi agricultura commutent ; ne latos fines parare studeant , potentioresque humiliores possessionibus expellant ; ne accuratius ad frigora atque aestus vitandos aedificent ; ne qua oriatur pecuniae cupiditas , qua ex re factiones dissensionesque nascuntur ; ut animi aequitate plebem contineant , cum suas quisque opes cum potentissimis aequari videat . <end>$$For this enactment they advance many reasons-lest seduced by long-continued custom , they may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture ; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estates , and the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions ; lest they construct their houses with too great a desire to avoid cold and heat ; lest the desire of wealth spring up , from which cause divisions and discords arise ; and that they may keep the common people in a contented state of mind , when each sees his own means placed on an equality with the most powerful .
<start> Civitatibus maxima laus est quam latissime circum se vastatis finibus solitudines habere . <end>$$It is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide deserts as possible around them , their frontiers having been laid waste .
<start> Hoc proprium virtutis existimant , expulsos agris finitimos cedere , neque quemquam prope audere consistere ; simul hoc se fore tutiores arbitrantur repentinae incursionis timore sublato . <end>$$They consider this the real evidence of their prowess , that their neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them , and that no one dare settle near them ; at the same time they think that they shall be on that account the more secure , because they have removed the apprehension of a sudden incursion .
<start> Cum bellum civitas aut illatum defendit aut infert , magistratus , qui ei bello praesint , ut vitae necisque habeant potestatem , deliguntur . <end>$$When a state either repels war waged against it , or wages it against another , magistrates are chosen to preside over that war with such authority , that they have power of life and death .
<start> In pace nullus est communis magistratus , sed principes regionum atque pagorum inter suos ius dicunt controversiasque minuunt . <end>$$In peace there is no common magistrate , but the chiefs of provinces and cantons administer justice and determine controversies among their own people .
<start> Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam , quae extra fines cuiusque civitatis fiunt , atque ea iuventutis exercendae ac desidiae minuendae causa fieri praedicant . <end>$$Robberies which are committed beyond the boundaries of each state bear no infamy , and they avow that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining their youth and of preventing sloth .
<start> Atque ubi quis ex principibus in concilio dixit se ducem fore , qui sequi velint , profiteantur , consurgunt ei qui et causam et hominem probant suumque auxilium pollicentur atque ab multitudine collaudantur : qui ex his secuti non sunt , in desertorum ac proditorum numero ducuntur , omniumque his rerum postea fides derogatur . <end>$$And when any of their chiefs has said in an assembly that he will be their leader , let those who are willing to follow , give in their names ; they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise and promise their assistance and are applauded by the people ; such of them as have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters and traitors , and confidence in all matters is afterward refused them .
<start> Hospitem violare fas non putant ; qui quacumque de causa ad eos venerunt , ab iniuria prohibent , sanctos habent , hisque omnium domus patent victusque communicatur . <end>$$To injure guests they regard as impious ; they defend from wrong those who have come to them for any purpose whatever , and esteem them inviolable ; to them the houses of all are open and maintenance is freely supplied .
<start> Ac fuit antea tempus , cum Germanos Galli virtute superarent , ultro bella inferrent , propter hominum multitudinem agrique inopiam trans Rhenum colonias mitterent . <end>$$And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans in prowess , and waged war on them offensively , and , on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land , sent colonies over the Rhine .
<start> Itaque ea quae fertilissima Germaniae sunt loca circum Hercyniam silvam , quam Eratostheni et quibusdam Graecis fama notam esse video , quam illi Orcyniam appellant , Volcae Tectosages occupaverunt atque ibi consederunt ; quae gens ad hoc tempus his sedibus sese continet summamque habet iustitiae et bellicae laudis opinionem . <end>$$Accordingly , the Volcae Tectosages , seized on those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful around the Hercynian forest , , and settled there Which nation to this time retains its position in those settlements , and has a very high character for justice and military merit ; now also they continue in the same scarcity , indigence , hardihood , as the Germans , and use the same food and dress ; but their proximity to the Province and knowledge of commodities from countries beyond the sea supplies to the Gauls many things tending to luxury as well as civilization .
<start> Huius Hercyniae silvae , quae supra demonstrata est , latitudo novem dierum iter expedito patet : non enim aliter finiri potest , neque mensuras itinerum noverunt . <end>$$The breadth of this Hercynian forest , which has been referred to above , is to a quick traveler , a journey of nine days .
<start> Est bos cervi figura , cuius a media fronte inter aures unum cornu exsistit excelsius magisque directum his , quae nobis nota sunt , cornibus : ab eius summo sicut palmae ramique late divunduntur . <end>$$There is an ox of the shape of a stag , between whose ears a horn rises from the middle of the forehead , higher and straighter than those horns which are known to us .
<start> Sunt item , quae appellantur alces . <end>$$There are also which are called elks .
<start> Harum est consimilis capris figura et varietas pellium , sed magnitudine paulo antecedunt mutilaeque sunt cornibus et crura sine nodis articulisque habent neque quietis causa procumbunt neque , si quo adflictae casu conciderunt , erigere sese aut sublevare possunt . <end>$$The shape of these , and the varied color of their skins , is much like roes , but in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns , and have legs without joints and ligatures ; nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest , nor , if they have been thrown down by any accident , can they raise or lift themselves up .
<start> His sunt arbores pro cubilibus : ad eas se applicant atque ita paulum modo reclinatae quietem capiunt Quarum ex vestigiis cum est animadversum a venatoribus , quo se recipere consuerint , omnes eo loco aut ab radicibus subruunt aut accidunt arbores , tantum ut summa species earum stantium relinquatur . <end>$$Trees serve as beds to them ; they lean themselves against them , and thus reclining only slightly , they take their rest ; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves , they either undermine all the trees at the roots , or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be left standing .
<start> Huc cum se consuetudine reclinaverunt , infirmas arbores pondere adfligunt atque una ipsae concidunt . <end>$$When they have leant upon them , according to their habit , they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees , and fall down themselves along with them .
<start> Tertium est genus eorum , qui uri appellantur . <end>$$There is a third kind , consisting of those animals which are called uri .
<start> Hi sunt magnitudine paulo infra elephantos , specie et colore et figura tauri . <end>$$These are a little below the elephant in size , and of the appearance , color , and shape of a bull .
<start> Magna vis eorum est et magna velocitas , neque homini neque ferae quam conspexerunt parcunt . <end>$$Their strength and speed are extraordinary ; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied .
<start> Hos studiose foveis captos interficiunt . <end>$$These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them .
<start> Hoc se labore durant adulescentes atque hoc genere venationis exercent , et qui plurimos ex his interfecerunt , relatis in publicum cornibus , quae sint testimonio , magnam ferunt laudem . <end>$$The young men harden themselves with this exercise , and practice themselves in this kind of hunting , and those who have slain the greatest number of them , having produced the horns in public , to serve as evidence , receive great praise .
<start> Sed adsuescere ad homines et mansuefieri ne parvuli quidem excepti possunt . <end>$$But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed .
<start> Amplitudo cornuum et figura et species multum a nostrorum boum cornibus differt . <end>$$The size , shape , and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen .
<start> Haec studiose conquisita ab labris argento circumcludunt atque in amplissimis epulis pro poculis utuntur . <end>$$These they anxiously seek after , and bind at the tips with silver , and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments .
<start> Caesar , postquam per Vbios exploratores comperit Suebos sese in silvas recepisse , inopiam frumenti veritus , quod , ut supra demonstravimus , minime omnes Germani agriculturae student , constituit non progredi longius ; sed , ne omnino metum reditus sui barbaris tolleret atque ut eorum auxilia tardaret , reducto exercitu partem ultimam pontis , quae ripas Vbiorum contingebat , in longitudinem pedum ducentorum rescindit atque in extremo ponte turrim tabulatorum quattuor constituit praesidiumque cohortium duodecim pontis tuendi causa ponit magnisque eum locum munitionibus firmat . <end>$$Caesar , after he discovered through the Ubian scouts that the Suevi had retired into their woods , apprehending a scarcity of corn , because , as we have observed above , all the Germans pay very little attention to agriculture , resolved not to proceed any further ; but , that he might not altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his return , and that he might delay their succors , having led back his army , he breaks down , to the length of 200 feet , the further end of the bridge , which joined the banks of the Ubii , and at the extremity of the bridge raises towers of four stories , and stations a guard of twelve cohorts for the purpose of defending the bridge , and strengthens the place with considerable fortifications .
<start> Ei loco praesidioque Gaium Volcatium Tullum adulescentem praefecit . <end>$$Over that fort and guard he appointed C .
<start> Ipse , cum maturescere frumenta inciperent , ad bellum Ambiorigis profectus per Arduennam silvam , quae est totius Galliae maxima atque ab ripis Rheni finibusque Treverorum ad Nervios pertinet milibusque amplius quingentis in longitudinem patet , Lucium Minucium Basilum cum omni equitatu praemittit , si quid celeritate itineris atque opportunitate temporis proficere possit ; monet , ut ignes in castris fieri prohibeat , ne qua eius adventus procul significatio fiat : sese confestim subsequi dicit . <end>$$Volcatius Tullus , a young man ; he himself , when the corn began to ripen , having set forth for the war with Ambiorix , he sends forward L Minucius Basilus with all the cavalry , to try if he might gain any advantage by rapid marches and the advantage of time , he warns him to forbid fires being made in the camp , lest any indication of his approach be given at a distance : he tells him that he will follow immediately .
<start> Basilus , ut imperatum est , facit Celeriter contraque omnium opinionem confecto itinere multos in agris inopinantes deprehendit : eorum indicio ad ipsum Ambiorigem contendit , quo in loco cum paucis equitibus esse dicebatur . <end>$$Basilus does as he was commanded ; having performed his march rapidly , and even surpassed the expectations of all , he surprises in the fields many not expecting him ; through their information he advances toward Ambiorix himself , to the place in which he was said to be with a few horse .
<start> Multum cum in omnibus rebus tum in re militari potest fortuna . <end>$$Fortune accomplishes much , not only in other matters , but also in the art of war .
<start> Nam magno accidit casu ut in ipsum incautum etiam atque imparatum incideret , priusque eius adventus ab omnibus videretur , quam fama ac nuntius adferretur : sic magnae fuit fortunae omni militari instrumento , quod circum se habebat , erepto , raedis equisque comprehensis ipsum effugere mortem . <end>$$For as it happened by a remarkable chance , that he fell upon himself unguarded and unprepared , and that his arrival was seen by the people before the report or information of his arrival was carried thither ; so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that , although every implement of war which he was accustomed to have about him was seized , and his chariots and horses surprised , yet he himself escaped death .
<start> Sed hoc quoque factum est , quod aedificio circumdato silva , ut sunt fere domicilia Gallorum , qui vitandi aestus causa plerumque silvarum atque fluminum petunt propinquitates , comites familiaresque eius angusto in loco paulisper equitum nostrorum vim sustinuerunt . <end>$$But it was effected owing to this circumstance , that his house being surrounded by a wood , his attendants and friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time the attack of our horse .
<start> His pugnantibus illum in equum quidam ex suis intulit : fugientem silvae texerunt . <end>$$While they were fighting , one of his followers mounted him on a horse ; the woods sheltered him as he fled .
<start> Sic et ad subeundum periculum et ad vitandum multum fortuna valuit . <end>$$Thus fortune tended much both toward his encountering and his escaping danger .
<start> Ambiorix copias suas iudicione non conduxerit , quod proelio dimicandum non existimarit , an tempore exclusus et repentino equitum adventu prohibitus , cum reliquum exercitum subsequi crederet , dubium est Sed certe dimissis per agros nuntiis sibi quemque consulere iussit Quorum pars in Arduennam silvam , pars in continentes paludes profugit ; qui proximi Oceano fuerunt , his insulis sese occultaverunt , quas aestus efficere consuerunt : multi ex suis finibus egressi se suaque omnia alienissimis crediderunt . <end>$$Whether Ambiorix did not collect his forces from cool deliberation , because he considered he ought not to engage in a battle , or he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden arrival of our horse , when he supposed the rest of the army was closely following , is doubtful : but certainly , dispatching messengers through the country , he ordered every one to provide for himself ; and a part of them fled into the forest Arduenna , a part into the extensive morasses ; those who were nearest the ocean concealed themselves in the islands which the tides usually form ; many , departing from their territories , committed themselves and all their possessions to perfect strangers .
<start> Catuvolcus , rex dimidiae partis Eburonum , qui una cum Ambiorige consilium inierat , aetate iam confectus , cum laborem aut belli aut fugae ferre non posset , omnibus precibus detestatus Ambiorigem , qui eius consilii auctor fuisset , taxo , cuius magna in Gallia Germaniaque copia est , se exanimavit . <end>$$Cativolcus , king of one half of the Eburones , who had entered into the design together with Ambiorix , since , being now worn out by age , he was unable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight , having cursed Ambiorix with every imprecation , as the person who had been the contriver of that measure , destroyed himself with the juice of the yew-tree , of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and Germany .
<start> Segni Condrusique , ex gente et numero Germanorum , qui sunt inter Eburones Treverosque , legatos ad Caesarem miserunt oratum , ne se in hostium numero duceret neve omnium Germanorum , qui essent citra Rhenum , unam esse causam iudicaret : nihil se de bello cogitavisse , nulla Ambiorigi auxilia misisse . <end>$$The Segui and Condrusi , of the nation and number of the Germans , and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri , sent embassadors to Caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies , nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the Rhine was one and the same ; that they had formed no plans of war , and had sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix .
<start> Caesar explorata re quaestione captivorum , si qui ad eos Eburones ex fuga convenissent , ad se ut reducerentur , imperavit ; si ita fecissent , fines eorum se violaturum negavit . <end>$$Caesar , having ascertained this fact by an examination of his prisoners , commanded that if any of the Eburones in their flight had repaired to them , they should be sent back to him ; he assures them that if they did that , he will not injure their territories .
<start> Tum copiis in tres partes distributis impedimenta omnium legionum Aduatucam contulit . <end>$$Then , having divided his forces into three parts , he sent the baggage of all the legions to Aduatuca .
<start> Id castelli nomen est . <end>$$That is the name of a fort .
<start> Hoc fere est in mediis Eburonum finibus , ubi Titurius atque Aurunculeius hiemandi causa consederant . <end>$$This is nearly in the middle of the Eburones , where Titurius and Aurunculeius had been quartered for the purpose of wintering .
<start> Hunc cum reliquis rebus locum probabat , tum quod superioris anni munitiones integrae manebant , ut militum laborem sublevaret . <end>$$This place he selected as well on other accounts as because the fortifications of the previous year remained , in order that he might relieve the labor of the soldiers .
<start> Praesidio impedimentis legionem quartamdecimam reliquit , unam ex eis tribus , quas proxime conscriptas ex Italia traduxerat . <end>$$He left the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage , one of those three which he had lately raised in Italy and brought over .
<start> Ei legioni castrisque Quintum Tullium Ciceronem praeficit ducentosque equites attribuit . <end>$$Over that legion and camp he places Q Tullius Cicero and gives him 200 horse .
<start> Partito exercitu Titum Labienum cum legionibus tribus ad Oceanum versus in eas partes quae Menapios attingunt proficisci iubet ; Gaium Trebonium cum pari legionum numero ad eam regionem quae ad Aduatucos adiacet depopulandam mittit ; ipse cum reliquis tribus ad flumen Scaldem , quod influit in Mosam , extremasque Arduennae partis ire constituit , quo cum paucis equitibus profectum Ambiorigem audiebat . <end>$$Having divided the army , he orders T Labienus to proceed with three legions toward the ocean into those parts which border on the Menapii ; he sends C Trebonius with a like number of legions to lay waste that district which lies contiguous to the Aduatuci ; he himself determines to go with the remaining three to the river Sambre , which flows into the Meuse , and to the most remote parts of Arduenna , whither he heard that Ambiorix had gone with a few horse .
<start> Discedens post diem septimum sese reversurum confirmat ; quam ad diem ei legioni quae in praesidio relinquebatur deberi frumentum sciebat . <end>$$When departing , he promises that he will return before the end of the seventh day , on which day he was aware corn was due to that legion which was being left in garrison .
<start> Labienum Treboniumque hortatur , si rei publicae commodo facere possint , ad eum diem revertantur , ut rursus communicato consilio exploratisque hostium rationibus aliud initium belli capere possint . <end>$$He directs Labienus and Trebonius to return by the same day , if they can do so agreeably to the interests of the republic ; so that their measures having been mutually imparted , and the plans of the enemy having been discovered , they might be able to commence a different line of operations .
<start> Erat , ut supra demonstravimus , manus certa nulla , non oppidum , non praesidium , quod se armis defenderet , sed in omnes partes dispersa multitudo . <end>$$There was , as we have above observed , no regular army , nor a town , nor a garrison which could defend itself by arms ; but the people were scattered in all directions .
<start> Vbi cuique aut valles abdita aut locus silvestris aut palus impedita spem praesidi aut salutis aliquam offerebat , consederat . <end>$$Where either a hidden valley , or a woody spot , or a difficult morass furnished any hope of protection or of security to any one , there he had fixed himself .
<start> Haec loca vicinitatibus erant nota , magnamque res diligentiam requirebat non in summa exercitus tuenda (nullum enim poterat universis perterritis ac dispersis periculum accidere) , sed in singulis militibus conservandis ; quae tamen ex parte res ad salutem exercitus pertinebat . <end>$$These places were known to those who dwelt in the neighborhood , and the matter demanded great attention , not so much in protecting the main body of the army , as in preserving individual soldiers ; which in some measure tended to the safety of the army .
<start> Nam et praedae cupiditas multos longius evocabat , et silvae incertis occultisque itineribus confertos adire prohibebant . <end>$$For both the desire of booty was leading many too far , and the woods with their unknown and hidden routes would not allow them to go in large bodies .
<start> Si negotium confici stirpemque hominum sceleratorum interfici vellet , dimittendae plures manus diducendique erant milites ; si continere ad signa manipulos vellet , ut instituta ratio et consuetudo exercitus Romani postulabat , locus ipse erat praesidio barbaris , neque ex occulto insidiandi et dispersos circumveniendi singulis deerat audacia . <end>$$If he desired the business to be completed and the race of those infamous people to be cut off , more bodies of men must be sent in several directions and the soldiers must be detached on all sides ; if he were disposed to keep the companies at their standards , as the established discipline and practice of the Roman army required , the situation itself was a safeguard to the barbarians , nor was there wanting to individuals the daring to lay secret ambuscades and beset scattered soldiers .
<start> Vt in eiusmodi difficultatibus , quantum diligentia provideri poterat providebatur , ut potius in nocendo aliquid praetermitteretur , etsi omnium animi ad ulciscendum ardebant , quam cum aliquo militum detrimento noceretur . <end>$$But amid difficulties of this nature as far as precautions could be taken by vigilance , such precautions were taken ; so that some opportunities of injuring the enemy were neglected , though the minds of all were burning to take revenge , rather than that injury should be effected with any loss to our soldiers .
<start> Dimittit ad finitimas civitates nuntios Caesar : omnes ad se vocat spe praedae ad diripiendos Eburones , ut potius in silvis Gallorum vita quam legionarius miles periclitetur , simul ut magna multitudine circumfusa pro tali facinore stirps ac nomen civitatis tollatur . <end>$$Caesar dispatches messengers to the neighboring states ; by the hope of booty he invites all to him , for the purpose of plundering the Eburones , in order that the life of the Gauls might be hazarded in the woods rather than the legionary soldiers ; at the same time , in order that a large force being drawn around them , the race and name of that state may be annihilated for such a crime .
<start> Magnus undique numerus celeriter convenit . <end>$$A large number from all quarters speedily assembles .
<start> Haec in omnibus Eburonum partibus gerebantur , diesque appetebat septimus , quem ad diem Caesar ad impedimenta legionemque reverti constituerat . <end>$$These things were going on in all parts of the territories of the Eburones , and the seventh day was drawing near , by which day Caesar had purposed to return to the baggage and the legion .
<start> Hic quantum in bello fortuna possit et quantos adferat casus cognosci potuit . <end>$$Here it might be learned how much fortune achieves in war , and how great casualties she produces .
<start> Dissipatis ac perterritis hostibus , ut demonstravimus , manus erat nulla quae parvam modo causam timoris adferret . <end>$$The enemy having been scattered and alarmed , as we related above , there was no force which might produce even a slight occasion of fear .
<start> Trans Rhenum ad Germanos pervenit fama , diripi Eburones atque ultro omnes ad praedam evocari . <end>$$The report extends beyond the Rhine to the Germans that the Eburones are being pillaged , and that all were without distinction invited to the plunder .
<start> Cogunt equitum duo milia Sugambri , qui sunt proximi Rheno , a quibus receptos ex fuga Tencteros atque Vsipetes supra docuimus Transeunt Rhenum navibus ratibusque triginta milibus passuum infra eum locum , ubi pons erat perfectus praesidiumque ab Caesare relictum : primos Eburonum fines adeunt ; multos ex fuga dispersos excipiunt , magno pecoris numero , cuius sunt cupidissimi barbari , potiuntur . <end>$$The Sigambri , who are nearest to the Rhine , by whom , we have mentioned above , the Tenchtheri and Usipetes were received after their retreat , collect 2 , 000 horse ; they cross the Rhine in ships and barks thirty miles below that place where the bridge was entire and the garrison left by Caesar ; they arrive at the frontiers of the Eburones , surprise many who were scattered in flight , and get possession of a large amount of cattle , of which barbarians are extremely covetous .
<start> Invitati praeda longius procedunt Non hos palus in bello latrociniisque natos , non silvae morantur Quibus in locis sit Caesar ex captivis quaerunt ; profectum longius reperiunt omnemque exercitum discessisse cognoscunt . <end>$$Allured by booty , they advance further ; neither morass nor forest obstructs these men , born amid war and depredations ; they inquire of their prisoners in what part Caesar is ; they find that he has advanced further , and learn that all the army has removed .
<start> Atque unus ex captivis Quid vos , inquit , hanc miseram ac tenuem sectamini praedam , quibus licet iam esse fortunatissimos ? Tribus horis Aduatucam venire potestis : huc omnes suas fortunas exercitus Romanorum contulit : praesidi tantum est , ut ne murus quidem cingi possit , neque quisquam egredi extra munitiones audeat . <end>$$Thereon one of the prisoners says , Why do you pursue such wretched and trifling spoil ; you , to whom it is granted to become even now most richly endowed by fortune ? In three hours you can reach Aduatuca ; there the Roman army has deposited all its fortunes ; there is so little of a garrison that not even the wall can be manned , nor dare any one go beyond the fortifications .
<start> Oblata spe Germani quam nacti erant praedam in occulto relinquunt ; ipsi Aduatucam contendunt usi eodem duce , cuius haec indicio cognoverant . <end>$$A hope having been presented them , the Germans leave in concealment the plunder they had acquired ; they themselves hasten to Aduatuca , employing as their guide the same man by whose information they had become informed of these things .
<start> Cicero , qui omnes superiores dies praeceptis Caesaris cum summa diligentia milites in castris continuisset ac ne calonem quidem quemquam extra munitionem egredi passus esset , septimo die diffidens de numero dierum Caesarem fidem servaturum , quod longius progressum audiebat , neque ulla de reditu eius fama adferebatur , simul eorum permotus vocibus , qui illius patientiam paene obsessionem appellabant , siquidem ex castris egredi non liceret , nullum eiusmodi casum exspectans , quo novem oppositis legionibus maximoque equitatu dispersis ac paene deletis hostibus in milibus passuum tribus offendi posset , quinque cohortes frumentatum in proximas segetes mittit , quas inter et castra unus omnino collis intererat . <end>$$Cicero , who during all the foregoing days had kept his soldiers in camp with the greatest exactness , and agreeable to the injunctions of Caesar , had not permitted even any of the camp-followers to go beyond the fortification , distrusting on the seventh day that Caesar would keep his promise as to the number of days , because he heard that he had proceeded further , and no report as to his return was brought to him , and being urged at the same time by the expressions of those who called his tolerance almost a siege , if , forsooth , it was not permitted them to go out of the camp , since he might expect no disaster , whereby he could be injured , within three miles of the camp , while nine legions and all the cavalry were under arms , and the enemy scattered and almost annihilated , sent five cohorts into the neighboring corn-lands , between which and the camp only one hill intervened , for the purpose of foraging .
<start> Complures erant ex legionibus aegri relicti ; ex quibus qui hoc spatio dierum convaluerant , circiter CCC , sub vexillo una mittuntur ; magna praeterea multitudo calonum , magna vis iumentorum , quae in castris subsederant , facta potestate sequitur . <end>$$Many soldiers of the legions had been left invalided in the camp , of whom those who had recovered in this space of time , being about 300 , are sent together under one standard ; a large number of soldiers' attendants besides , with a great number of beasts of burden , which had remained in the camp , permission being granted , follow them .
<start> Hoc ipso tempore et casu Germani equites interveniunt protinusque eodem illo , quo venerant , cursu ab decumana porta in castra irrumpere conantur , nec prius sunt visi obiectis ab ea parte silvis , quam castris appropinquarent , usque eo ut qui sub vallo tenderent mercatores recipiendi sui facultatem non haberent . <end>$$At this very time , the German horse by chance came up , and immediately , with the same speed with which they had advanced , attempt to force the camp at the Decuman gate , nor were they seen , in consequence of woods lying in the way on that side , before they were just reaching the camp : so much so , that the sutlers who had their booths under the rampart had not an opportunity of retreating within the camp .
<start> Inopinantes nostri re nova perturbantur , ac vix primum impetum cohors in statione sustinet . <end>$$Our men , not anticipating it , are perplexed by the sudden affair , and the cohort on the outpost scarcely sustains the first attack .
<start> Circumfunduntur ex reliquis hostes partibus , si quem aditum reperire possent . <end>$$The enemy spread themselves on the other sides to ascertain if they could find any access .
<start> Aegre portas nostri tuentur , reliquos aditus locus ipse per se munitioque defendit . <end>$$Our men with difficulty defend the gates ; the very position of itself and the fortification secures the other accesses .
<start> Totis trepidatur castris , atque alius ex alio causam tumultus quaerit ; neque quo signa ferantur neque quam in partem quisque conveniat provident . <end>$$There is a panic in the entire camp , and one inquires of another the cause of the confusion , nor do they readily determine whither the standards should be borne , nor into what quarter each should betake himself .
<start> Alius iam castra capta pronuntiat , alius deleto exercitu atque imperatore victores barbaros venisse contendit ; plerique novas sibi ex loco religiones fingunt Cottaeque et Tituri calamitatem , qui in eodem occiderint castello , ante oculos ponunt . <end>$$One avows that the camp is already taken , another maintains that , the enemy having destroyed the army and commander-in-chief , are come hither as conquerors ; most form strange superstitious fancies from the spot , and place before their eyes the catastrophe of Cotta and Titurius , who had fallen in the same fort .
<start> Tali timore omnibus perterritis confirmatur opinio barbaris , ut ex captivo audierant , nullum esse intus praesidium . <end>$$All being greatly disconcerted by this alarm , the belief of the barbarians is strengthened that there is no garrison within , as they had heard from their prisoner .
<start> Perrumpere nituntur seque ipsi adhortantur , ne tantam fortunam ex manibus dimittant . <end>$$They endeavor to force an entrance and encourage one another not to cast from their hands so valuable a prize .
<start> Erat aeger cum praesidio relictus Publius Sextius Baculus , qui primum pilum ad Caesarem duxerat , cuius mentionem superioribus proeliis fecimus , ac diem iam quintum cibo caruerat . <end>$$P Sextius Baculus , who had led a principal century under Caesar , had been left an invalid in the garrison , and had now been five days without food .
<start> Hic diffisus suae atque omnium saluti inermis ex tabernaculo prodit : videt imminere hostes atque in summo esse rem discrimine : capit arma a proximis atque in porta consistit . <end>$$He , distrusting his own safety and that of all , goes forth from his tent unarmed ; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is in the utmost danger ; he snatches arms from those nearest , and stations himself at the gate .
<start> Consequuntur hunc centuriones eius cohortis quae in statione erat : paulisper una proelium sustinent . <end>$$The centurions of that cohort which was on guard follow him ; for a short time they sustain the fight together .
<start> Relinquit animus Sextium gravibus acceptis vulneribus : aegre per manus tractus servatur . <end>$$Sextius faints , after receiving many wounds ; he is with difficulty saved , drawn away by the hands of the soldiers .
<start> Hoc spatio interposito reliqui sese confirmant tantum , ut in munitionibus consistere audeant speciemque defensorum praebeant . <end>$$This space having intervened , the others resume courage so far as to venture to take their place on the fortifications and present the aspect of defenders .
<start> Interim confecta frumentatione milites nostri clamorem exaudiunt : praecurrunt equites ; quanto res sit in periculo cognoscunt . <end>$$The foraging having in the mean time been completed , our soldiers distinctly hear the shout ; the horse hasten on before and discover in what danger the affair is .
<start> Hic vero nulla munitio est quae perterritos recipiat : modo conscripti atque usus militaris imperiti ad tribunum militum centurionesque ora convertunt ; quid ab his praecipiatur exspectant . <end>$$But here there is no fortification to receive them , in their alarm : those last enlisted , and unskilled in military discipline turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions ; they wait to find what orders may be given by them .
<start> Nemo est tam fortis quin rei novitate perturbetur . <end>$$No one is so courageous as not to be disconcerted by the suddenness of the affair .
<start> Barbari signa procul conspicati oppugnatione desistunt : redisse primo legiones credunt , quas longius discessisse ex captivis cognoverant ; postea despecta paucitate ex omnibus partibus impetum faciunt . <end>$$The barbarians , espying our standard in the distance , desist from the attack ; at first they suppose that the legions , which they had learned from their prisoners had removed further off , had returned ; afterward , despising their small number , they make an attack on them at all sides .
<start> Calones in proximum tumulum procurrunt Hinc celeriter deiecti se in signa manipulosque coniciunt : eo magis timidos perterrent milites . <end>$$The camp-followers run forward to the nearest rising ground ; being speedily driven from this they throw themselves among the standards and companies : they thus so much the more alarm the soldiers already affrighted .
<start> Alii cuneo facto ut celeriter perrumpant censent , quoniam tam propinqua sint castra , et si pars aliqua circumventa ceciderit , at reliquos servari posse confidunt ; alii , ut in iugo consistant atque eundem omnes ferant casum . <end>$$Some propose that , forming a wedge , they suddenly break through , since the camp was so near ; and if any part should be surrounded and slain , they fully trust that at least the rest may be saved ; others , that they take their stand on an eminence , and all undergo the same destiny .
<start> Hoc veteres non probant milites , quos sub vexillo una profectos docuimus . <end>$$The veteran soldiers whom we stated to have set out together under a standard , do not approve of this .
<start> Itaque inter se cohortati duce Gaio Trebonio , equite Romano , qui eis erat praepositus , per medios hostes perrumpunt incolumesque ad unum omnes in castra perveniunt . <end>$$Therefore encouraging each other , under the conduct of Caius Trebonius , a Roman knight , who had been appointed over them , they break through the midst of the enemy , and arrive in the camp safe to a man .
<start> Hos subsecuti calones equitesque eodem impetu militum virtute servantur . <end>$$The camp attendants and the horse following close upon them with the same impetuosity , are saved by the courage of the soldiers .
<start> At ei qui in iugo constiterant , nullo etiam nunc usu rei militaris percepto neque in eo quod probaverant consilio permanere , ut se loco superiore defenderent , neque eam quam prodesse aliis vim celeritatemque viderant imitari potuerunt , sed se in castra recipere conati iniquum in locum demiserunt . <end>$$But those who had taken their stand upon the eminence having even now acquired no experience of military matters , neither could persevere in that resolution which they approved of , namely , to defend themselves from their higher position , nor imitate that vigor and speed which they had observed to have availed others ; but , attempting to reach the camp , had descended into an unfavorable situation .
<start> Centuriones , quorum nonnulli ex inferioribus ordinibus reliquarum legionum virtutis causa in superiores erant ordines huius legionis traducti , ne ante partam rei militaris laudem amitterent , fortissime pugnantes conciderunt . <end>$$The centurions , some of whom had been promoted for their valor from the lower ranks of other legions to higher ranks in this legion , in order that they might not forfeit their glory for military exploits previously acquired , fell together fighting most valiantly .
<start> Militum pars horum virtute summotis hostibus praeter spem incolumis in castra pervenit , pars a barbaris circumventa periit . <end>$$The enemy having been dislodged by their valor , a part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their expectations ; a part perished , surrounded by the barbarians .
<start> Germani desperata expugnatione castrorum , quod nostros iam constitisse in munitionibus videbant , cum ea praeda quam in silvis deposuerant trans Rhenum sese receperunt . <end>$$The Germans , despairing of taking the camp by storm , because they saw that our men had taken up their position on the fortifications , retreated beyond the Rhine with that plunder which they had deposited in the woods .
<start> Sic omnino animos timor praeoccupaverat ut paene alienata mente deletis omnibus copiis equitatum se ex fuga recepisse dicerent neque in columi exercitu Germanos castra oppugnaturos fuisse contenderent . <end>$$Volusenus , who had been sent with the cavalry , arrived that night , he could not gain credence that Caesar was close at hand with his army safe .
<start> Reversus ille eventus belli non ignorans unum , quod cohortes ex statione et praesidio essent emissae , questus ne minimo quidem casu locum relinqui debuisse , multum fortunam in repentino hostium adventu potuisse iudicavit , multo etiam amplius , quod paene ab ipso vallo portisque castrorum barbaros avertisset . <end>$$He , on his return , being well aware of the casualties of war , complained of one thing , namely , that the cohorts had been sent away from the outposts and garrison , and pointed out that room ought not to have been left for even the most trivial casualty ; that fortune had exercised great influence in the sudden arrival of their enemy ; much greater , in that she had turned the barbarians away from the very rampart and gates of the camp .
<start> Quarum omnium rerum maxime admirandum videbatur , quod Germani , qui eo consilio Rhenum transierant , ut Ambiorigis fines depopularentur , ad castra Romanorum delati optatissimum Ambiorigi beneficium obtulerunt . <end>$$Of all which events , it seemed the most surprising , that the Germans , who had crossed the Rhine with this object , that they might plunder the territories of Ambiorix , being led to the camp of the Romans , rendered Ambiorix a most acceptable service .
<start> Caesar rursus ad vexandos hostes profectus magno coacto numero ex finitimis civitatibus in omnes partes dimittit . <end>$$Caesar , having again marched to harass the enemy , after collecting a large number from the neighboring states , dispatches them in all directions .
<start> Omnes vici atque omnia aedificia quae quisque conspexerat incendebantur ; praeda ex omnibus locis agebatur ; frumenta non solum tanta multitudine iumentorum atque hominum consumebantur , sed etiam anni tempore atque imbribus procubuerant ut , si qui etiam in praesentia se occultassent , tamen his deducto exercitu rerum omnium inopia pereundum videretur . <end>$$All the villages and all the buildings , which each beheld , were on fire : spoil was being driven off from all parts ; the corn not only was being consumed by so great numbers of cattle and men , but also had fallen to the earth , owing to the time of the year and the storms ; so that if any had concealed themselves for the present , still , it appeared likely that they must perish through want of all things , when the army should be drawn off .
<start> Ac saepe in eum locum ventum est tanto in omnes partes diviso equitatu , ut modo visum ab se Ambiorigem in fuga circumspicerent captivi nec plane etiam abisse ex conspectu contenderent , ut spe consequendi illata atque infinito labore suscepto , qui se summam ab Caesare gratiam inituros putarent , paene naturam studio vincerent , semperque paulum ad summam felicitatem defuisse videretur , atque ille latebris aut saltibus se eriperet et noctu occultatus alias regiones partesque peteret non maiore equitum praesidio quam quattuor , quibus solis vitam suam committere audebat . <end>$$And frequently it came to that point , as so large a body of cavalry had been sent abroad in all directions , that the prisoners declared Ambiorix had just then been seen by them in flight , and had not even passed out of sight , so that the hope of overtaking him being raised , and unbounded exertions having been resorted to , those who thought they should acquire the highest favor with Caesar , nearly overcame nature by their ardor , and continually , a little only seemed wanting to complete success ; but he rescued himself by lurking-places and forests , and , concealed by the night made for other districts and quarters , with no greater guard than that of four horsemen , to whom along he ventured to confide his life .
<start> Tali modo vastatis regionibus exercitum Caesar duarum cohortium damno Durocortorum Remorum reducit concilioque in eum locum Galliae indicto de coniuratione Senonum et Carnutum quaestionem habere instituit et de Accone , qui princeps eius consili fuerat , graviore sententia pronuntiata more maiorum supplicium sumpsit . <end>$$Having devastated the country in such a manner , Caesar leads back his army with the loss of two cohorts to Durocortorum of the Remi , and , having summoned a council of Gaul to assemble at that place , he resolved to hold an investigation respecting the conspiracy of the Senones and Carnutes , and having pronounced a most severe sentence upon Acco , who had been the contriver of that plot , he punished him after the custom of our ancestors .
<start> Nonnulli iudicium veriti profugerunt Quibus cum aqua atque igni interdixisset , duas legiones ad fines Treverorum , duas in Lingonibus , sex reliquas in Senonum finibus Agedinci in hibernis collocavit frumentoque exercitui proviso , ut iustituerat , in Italiam ad conventus agendos profectus est . <end>$$Some fearing a trial , fled ; when he had forbidden these fire and water , he stationed in winter quarters two legions at the frontiers of the Treviri , two among the Lingones , the remaining six at Agendicum , in the territories of the Senones ; and , having provided corn for the army , he set out for Italy , as he had determined , to hold the assizes .
<start> Quieta Gallia Caesar , ut constituerat , in Italiam ad conventus agendos proficiscitur . <end>$$Gaul being tranquil , Caesar , as he had determined , sets out for Italy to hold the provincial assizes .
<start> Ibi cognoscit de Clodii caede senatusque consulto certior factus , ut omnes iuniores Italiae coniurarent , delectum tota provincia habere instituit . <end>$$There he receives intelligence of the death of Clodius ; and , being informed of the decree of the senate , that all the youth of Italy should take the military oath , he determined to hold a levy throughout the entire province .
<start> Eae res in Galliam Transalpinam celeriter perferuntur . <end>$$Report of these events is rapidly borne into Transalpine Gaul .
<start> Addunt ipsi et ad fingunt rumoribus Galli , quod res poscere videbatur , retineri urbano motu Caesarem neque in tantis dissensionibus ad exercitum venire posse . <end>$$The Gauls themselves add to the report , and invent what the case seemed to require , that Caesar was detained by commotions in the city , and could not , amid so violent dissensions , come to his army .
<start> Hac impulsi occasione , qui iam ante se populi Romani imperio subiectos dolerent liberius atque audacius de bello consilia inire incipiunt . <end>$$Animated by this opportunity , they who already , previously to this occurrence , were indignant that they were reduced beneath the dominion of Rome , begin to organize their plans for war more openly and daringly .
<start> Indictis inter se principes Galliae conciliis silvestribus ac remotis locis queruntur de Acconis morte ; posse hunc casum ad ipsos recidere demonstrant : miserantur communem Galliae fortunam : omnibus pollicitationibus ac praemius deposcunt qui belli initium faciant et sui capitis periculo Galliam in libertatem vindicent . <end>$$The leading men of Gaul , having convened councils among themselves in the woods , and retired places , complain of the death of Acco : they point out that this fate may fall in turn on themselves : they bewail the unhappy fate of Gaul ; and by every sort of promises and rewards , they earnestly solicit some to begin the war , and assert the freedom of Gaul at the hazard of their lives .
<start> In primis rationem esse habendam dicunt , priusquam eorum clandestina consilia efferantur , ut Caesar ab exercitu intercludatur . <end>$$They say that special care should be paid to this , that Caesar should be cut off from his army before their secret plans should be divulged .
<start> Id esse facile , quod neque legiones audeant absente imperatore ex hibernis egredi , neque imperator sine praesidio ad legiones pervenire possit Postremo in acie praestare interfici quam non veterem belli gloriam libertatemque quam a maioribus acce perint recuperare . <end>$$That this was easy , because neither would the legions , in the absence of their general , dare to leave their winter quarters , nor could the general reach his army without a guard : finally , that it was better to be slain in battle , than not to recover their ancient glory in war , and that freedom which they had received from their forefathers .
<start> Vbi ea dies venit , Carnutes Cotuato et Conconnetodumno ducibus , desperatis hominibus , Cenabum signo dato concurrunt civesque Romanos , qui negotiandi causa ibi constiterant , in his Gaium Fufium Citam , honestum equitem Romanum , qui rei frumentariae iussu Caesaris praeerat , interficiunt bonaque eorum diripiunt . <end>$$When the appointed day came , the Carnutes , under the command of Cotuatus and Conetodunus , desperate men , meet together at Genabum , and slay the Roman citizens who had settled there for the purpose of trading , and plunder their property .
<start> Celeriter ad omnes Galliae civitates fama perfertur Nam ubicumque maior atque illustrior incidit res , clamore per agros regionesque significant ; hunc alii deinceps excipiunt et proximis tradunt , ut tum accidit Nam quae Cenabi oriente sole gesta essent , ante primam confectam vigiliam in finibus Arvernorum audita sunt , quod spatium est milium passuum circiter centum LX . <end>$$The report is quickly spread among all the states of Gaul ; for , whenever a more important and remarkable event takes place , they transmit the intelligence through their lands and districts by a shout ; the others take it up in succession , and pass it to their neighbors , as happened on this occasion ; for the things which were done at Genabum at sunrise , were heard in the territories of the Arverni before the end of the first watch , which is an extent of more than a hundred and sixty miles .
<start> Simili ratione ibi Vercingetorix , Celtilli filius , Arveruus , summae potentiae adulescens , cuius pater principatum Galliae totius obtinuerat et ob eam causam , quod regnum appetebat , ab civitate erat interfectus , convocatis suis clientibus facile incendit . <end>$$There in like manner , Vercingetorix the son of Celtillus the Arvernian , a young man of the highest power , summoned together his dependents , and easily excited them .
<start> Cognito eius consilio ad arma concurritur Prohibetur ab Gobannitione , patruo suo , reliquisque principibus , qui hanc temptandam fortunam non existimabant ; expellitur ex oppido Gergovia ; non destitit tamen atque in agris habet dilectum egentium ac perditorum . <end>$$On his design being made known , they rush to arms : he is expelled from the town of Gergovia , by his uncle Gobanitio and the rest of the nobles , who were of opinion , that such an enterprise ought not to be hazarded : he did not however desist , but held in the country a levy of the needy and desperate .
<start> Hac coacta manu , quoscumque adit ex civitate ad suam sententiam perducit ; hortatur ut communis libertatis causa arma capiant , magnisque coactis copiis adversarios suos a quibus paulo ante erat eiectus expellit ex civitate . <end>$$Having collected such a body of troops , he brings over to his sentiments such of his fellow-citizens as he has access to : he exhorts them to take up arms in behalf of the general freedom , and having assembled great forces he drives from the state his opponents , by whom he had been expelled a short time previously .
<start> Rex ab suis appellatur Dimittit quoque versus legationes ; obtestatur ut in fide maneant . <end>$$He is saluted king by his partisans ; he sends embassadors in every direction , he conjures them to adhere firmly to their promise .
<start> Celeriter sibi Senones , Parisios , Pictones , Cadurcos , Turonos , Aulercos , Lemovices , Andos reliquosque omnes qui Oceanum attingunt adiungit : omnium consensu ad eum defertur imperium . <end>$$He quickly attaches to his interests the Senones , Parisii , Pictones , Cadurci , Turones , Aulerci , Lemovice , and all the others who border on the ocean ; the supreme command is conferred on him by unanimous consent .
<start> Qua oblata potestate omnibus his civitatibus obsides imperat , certum numerum militum ad se celeriter adduci iubet , armorum quantum quaeque civitas domi quodque ante tempus efficiat constituit ; in primis equitatui studet . <end>$$On obtaining this authority , he demands hostages from all these states , he orders a fixed number of soldiers to be sent to him immediately ; he determines what quantity of arms each state shall prepare at home , and before what time ; he pays particular attention to the cavalry .
<start> Summae diligentiae summam imperi severitatem addit ; magnitudine supplici dubitantes cogit Nam maiore commisso delicto igni atque omnibus tormentis necat , leviore de causa auribus desectis aut singulis effossis oculis domum remittit , ut sint reliquis documento et magnitudine poenae perterreant alios . <end>$$To the utmost vigilance he adds the utmost rigor of authority ; and by the severity of his punishments brings over the wavering : for on the commission of a greater crime he puts the perpetrators to death by fire and every sort of tortures ; for a slighter cause , he sends home the offenders with their ears cut off , or one of their eyes put out , that they may be an example to the rest , and frighten others by the severity of their punishment .
<start> His suppliciis celeriter coacto exercitu Lucterium Cadurcum , summae hominem audaciae , cum parte copiarum in Rutenos mittit ; ipse in Bituriges proficiscitur . <end>$$Having quickly collected an army by their punishments , he sends Lucterius , one of the Cadurci , a man the utmost daring , with part of his forces , into the territory of the Ruteni ; and marches in person into the country of the Bituriges .
<start> Eius adventu Bituriges ad Aeduos , quorum erant in fide , legatos mittunt subsidium rogatum , quo facilius hostium copias sustinere possint . <end>$$On his arrival , the Bituriges send embassadors to the Aedui , under whose protection they were , to solicit aid in order that they might more easily resist the forces of the enemy .
<start> Aedui de consilio legatorum , quos Caesar ad exercitum reliquerat , copias equitatus peditatusque subsidio Biturigibus mittunt . <end>$$The Aedui , by the advice of the lieutenants whom Caesar had left with the army , send supplies of horse and foot to succor the Bituriges .
<start> Qui cum ad flumen Ligerim venissent , quod Bituriges ab Aeduis dividit , paucos dies ibi morati neque flumen transire ausi domum revertuntur legatisque nostris renuntiant se Biturigum perfidiam veritos revertisse , quibus id consili fuisse cognoverint , ut , si flumen transissent , una ex parte ipsi , altera Arverni se circumsisterent . <end>$$When they came to the river Loire , which separates the Bituriges from the Aedui , they delayed a few days there , and , not daring to pass the river , return home , and send back word to the lieutenants that they had returned through fear of the treachery of the Bituriges , who , they ascertained , had formed this design , that if the Aedui should cross the river , the Bituriges on the one side , and the Arverni on the other , should surround them .
<start> Id eane de causa , quam legatis pronuntiarunt , an perfidia adducti fecerint , quod nihil nobis constat , non videtur pro certo esse proponendum . <end>$$Whether they did this for the reason which they alleged to the lieutenants , or influenced by treachery , we think that we ought not to state as certain , because we have no proof .
<start> Bituriges eorum discessu statim cum Arvernis iunguntur . <end>$$On their departure , the Bituriges immediately unite themselves to the Arverni .
<start> His rebus in Italiam Caesari nuntiatis , cum iam ille urbanas res virtute Gnaeus Pompei commodiorem in statum pervenisse intellegeret , in Transalpinam Galliam profectus est . <end>$$These affairs being announced to Caesar in Italy , at the time when he understood that matters in the city had been reduced to a more tranquil state by the energy of Cneius Pompey , he set out for Transalpine Gaul .
<start> Eo cum venisset , magna difficultate adficiebatur , qua ratione ad exercitum pervenire posset . <end>$$After he had arrived there , he was greatly at a loss to know by what means he could reach his army .
<start> Nam si legiones in provinciam arcesseret , se absente in itinere proelio dimicaturas intellegebat ; si ipse ad exercitum contenderet , ne eis quidem eo tempore qui quieti viderentur suam salutem recte committi videbat . <end>$$For if he should summon the legions into the province , he was aware that on their march they would have to fight in his absence ; he foresaw too that if he himself should endeavor to reach the army , he would act injudiciously , in trusting his safety even to those who seemed to be tranquilized .
<start> Interim Lucterius Cadurcus in Rutenos missus eam civitatem Arvernis conciliat . <end>$$In the mean time Lucterius the Cadurcan , having been sent into the country of the Ruteni , gains over that state to the Arverni .
<start> Progressus in Nitiobriges et Gabalos ab utrisque obsides accipit et magna coacta manu in provinciam Narbonem versus eruptionem facere contendit . <end>$$Having advanced into the country of the Nitiobriges , and Gabali , he receives hostages from both nations , and , assembling a numerous force , marches to make a descent on the province in the direction of Narbo .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Caesar omnibus consiliis antevertendum existimavit , ut Narbonem proficisceretur . <end>$$Caesar , when this circumstance was announced to him , thought that the march to Narbo ought to take the precedence of all his other plans .
<start> Eo cum venisset , timentes confirmat , praesidia in Rutenis provincialibus , Volcis Arecomicis , Tolosatibus circumque Narbonem , quae loca hostibus erant finitima , constituit ; partem copiarum ex provincia supplementumque , quod ex Italia adduxerat , in Helvios , qui fines Arvernorum contingunt , convenire iubet . <end>$$When he arrived there , he encourages the timid and stations garrisons among the Ruteni , in the province of the Volcae Arecomici , and the country around Narbo which was in the vicinity of the enemy ; he orders a portion of the forces from the province , and the recruits which he had brought from Italy , to rendezvous among the Helvii who border on the territories of the Arverni .
<start> Etsi mons Cevenna , qui Arvernos ab Helviis discludit , durissimo tempore anni altissima nive iter impediebat , tamen discussa nive sex in altitudinem pedum atque ita viis patefactis summo militum sudore ad fines Arvernorum pervenit . <end>$$This people being surprised , because they considered themselves defended by the Cevennes as by a wall , and the paths at this season of the year had never before been passable even to individuals , he orders the cavalry to extend themselves as far as they could , and strike as great a panic as possible into the enemy .
<start> Celeriter haec fama ac nuntiis ad Vercingetorigem perferuntur ; quem perterriti omnes Arverni circumsistunt atque obsecrant , ut suis fortunis consulat , neve ab hostibus diripiautur , praesertim cum videat omne ad se bellum translatum . <end>$$Around him all the Arverni crowd in alarm , and solemnly entreat him to protect their property , and not to suffer them to be plundered by the enemy , especially as he saw that all the war was transferred into their country .
<start> Quorum ille precibus per motus castra ex Biturigibus movet in Arveruos versus . <end>$$Being prevailed upon by their entreaties he moves his camp from the country of the Bituriges in the direction of the Arverni .
<start> At Caesar biduum in his locis moratus , quod haec de Vercingetorige usu ventura opinione praeceperat , per causam supplementi equitatusque cogendi ab exercitu discedit ; Brutum adulescentem his copiis praeficit ; hunc monet , ut in omnes partes equites quam latissime pervagentur : daturum se operam , ne longius triduo ab castris absit . <end>$$Caesar , having delayed two days in that place , because he had anticipated that , in the natural course of events , such would be the conduct of Vercingetorix , leaves the army under pretense of raising recruits and cavalry : he places Brutus , a young man , in command of these forces ; he gives him instructions that the cavalry should range as extensively as possible in all directions ; that he would exert himself not to be absent from the camp longer than three days .
<start> His constitutis rebus suis inopinantibus quam maximis potest itineribus Viennam pervenit . <end>$$Having arranged these matters , he marches to Vienna by as long journeys as he can , when his own soldiers did not expect him .
<start> Ibi nactus recentem equitatum , quem multis ante diebus eo praemiserat , neque diurno neque nocturno itinere intermisso per fines Aeduorum in Lingones contendit , ubi duae legiones hiemabant , ut , si quid etiam de sua salute ab Aeduis iniretur consili , celeritate praecurreret . <end>$$Finding there a fresh body of cavalry , which he had sent on to that place several days before , marching incessantly night and day , he advanced rapidly through the territory of the Aedui into that of the Lingones , in which two legions were wintering , that , if any plan affecting his own safety should have been organized by the Aedui , he might defeat it by the rapidity of his movements .
<start> Eo cum pervenisset , ad reliquas legiones mittit priusque omnes in unum locum cogit quam de eius adventu Arvernis nuntiari posset . <end>$$When he arrived there , he sends information to the rest of the legions , and gathers all his army into one place before intelligence of his arrival could be announced to the Arverni .
<start> Hac re cognita Vercingetorix rursus in Bituriges exercitum reducit atque inde profectus Gorgobinam , Boiorum oppidum , quos ibi Helvetico proelio victos Caesar collocaverat Aeduisque attribuerat , oppugnare instituit . <end>$$Vercingetorix , on hearing this circumstance , leads back his army into the country of the Bituriges ; and after marching from it to Gergovia , a town of the Boii , whom Caesar had settled there after defeating them in the Helvetian war , and had rendered tributary to the Aedui , he determined to attack it .
<start> Magnam haec res Caesari difficultatem ad consilium capiendum adferebat , si reliquam partem hiemis uno loco legiones contineret , ne stipendiariis Aeduorum expugnatis cuncta Gallia deficeret , quod nullum amicis in eo praesidium videretur positum esse ; si maturius ex hibernis educeret , ne ab re frumentaria duris subvectionibus laboraret . <end>$$This action caused great perplexity to Caesar in the selection of his plans ; lest , if he should confine his legions in one place for the remaining portion of the winter , all Gaul should revolt when the tributaries of the Aedui were subdued , because it would appear that there was in him no protection for his friends ; but if he should draw them too soon out of their winter quarters , he might be distressed by the want of provisions , in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance .
<start> Praestare visum est tamen omnis difficultates perpeti , quam tanta contumelia accepta omnium suorum voluntates alienare . <end>$$It seemed better , however , to endure every hardship than to alienate the affections of all his allies , by submitting to such an insult .
<start> Itaque cohortatus Aeduos de supportando commeatu praemittit ad Boios qui de suo adventu doceant hortenturque ut in fide maneant atque hostium impetum magno animo sustineant . <end>$$Having , therefore , impressed on the Aedui the necessity of supplying him with provisions , he sends forward messengers to the Boii to inform them of his arrival , and encourage them to remain firm in their allegiance , and resist the attack of the enemy with great resolution .
<start> Duabus Agedinci legionibus atque impedimentis totius exer citus relictis ad Boios proficiscitur . <end>$$Having left two legions and the luggage of the entire army at Agendicum , he marches to the Boii .
<start> Altero die cum ad oppidum Senonum Vellaunodunum venisset , ne quem post se hostem relinqueret , quo expeditiore re frumentaria uteretur , oppugnare instituit idque biduo circumvallavit ; tertio die missis ex oppido legatis de deditione arma conferri , iumenta produci , sescentos obsides dari iubet . <end>$$On the second day , when he came to Vellaunodunum , a town of the Senones , he determined to attack it , in order that he might not leave an enemy in his rear , and might the more easily procure supplies of provisions , and draw a line of circumvallation around it in two days : on the third day , embassadors being sent from the town to treat of a capitulation , he orders their arms to be brought together , their cattle to be brought forth , and six hundred hostages to be given .
<start> Ea qui conficeret , a Trebonium legatum relinquit Ipse , ut quam primum iter faceret , Cenabum Carnutum proficiscitur ; qui tum primum allato nuntio de oppugnatione Vellaunoduni , cum longius eam rem ductum iri existimarent , praesidium Cenabi tuendi causa , quod eo mitterent , comparabant . <end>$$He leaves Caius Trebonius his lieutenant , to complete these arrangements ; he himself sets out with the intention of marching as soon as possible , to Genabum , a town of the Carnutes , who having then for the first time received information of the siege of Vellaunodunum , as they thought that it would be protracted to a longer time , were preparing a garrison to send to Genabum for the defense of that town .
<start> Huc biduo pervenit Castris ante oppidum positis diei tempore exclusus in posterum oppugnationem differt quaeque ad eam rem usui sint militibus imperat et , quod oppidum Cenabum pons fluminis Ligeris contingebat , veritus ne noctu ex oppido profugerent , duas legiones in armis excubare iubet . <end>$$Caesar arrived here in two days ; after pitching his camp before the town , being prevented by the time of the day , he defers the attack to the next day , and orders his soldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that enterprise ; and as a bridge over the Loire connected the town of Genabum with the opposite bank , fearing lest the inhabitants should escape by night from the town , he orders two legions to keep watch under arms .
<start> Cenabenses paulo ante mediam noctem silentio ex oppido egressi flumen transire coeperunt . <end>$$The people of Genabum came forth silently from the city before midnight , and began to cross the river .
<start> Qua re per exploratores nuntiata Caesar legiones quas expeditas esse iusserat portis incensis intromittit atque oppido potitur , perpaucis ex hostium numero desideratis quin cuncti caperentur , quod pontis atque itinerum angustiae multitudinis fugam intercluserant . <end>$$When this circumstance was announced by scouts , Caesar , having set fire to the gates , sends in the legions which he had ordered to be ready , and obtains possession of the town so completely , that very few of the whole number of the enemy escaped being taken alive , because the narrowness of the bridge and the roads prevented the multitude from escaping .
<start> Oppidum diripit atque incendit , praedam militibus donat , exercitum Ligerem traducit atque in Biturigum fines pervenit . <end>$$He pillages and burns the town , gives the booty to the soldiers , then leads his army over the Loire , and marches into the territories of the Bituriges .
<start> Vercingetorix , ubi de Caesaris adventu cognovit , oppuguatione destitit atque obviam Caesari proficiscitur . <end>$$Vercingetorix , when he ascertained the arrival of Caesar , desisted from the siege , and marched to meet Caesar .
<start> Ille oppidum Biturigum positum in via Noviodunum oppugnare instituerat Quo ex oppido cum legati ad eum venissent oratum ut sibi ignosceret suaeque vitae consuleret , ut celeritate reliquas res conficeret , qua pleraque erat consecutus , arma conferri , equos produci , obsides dari iubet . <end>$$The latter had commenced to besiege Noviodunum ; and when embassadors came from this town to beg that he would pardon them and spare their lives , in order that he might execute the rest of his designs with the rapidity by which he had accomplished most of them , he orders their arms to be collected , their horses to be brought forth , and hostages to be given .
<start> Parte iam obsidum tradita , cum reliqua administrarentur , centurionibus et paucis militibus intromissis , qui arma iumentaque conquirerent , equitatus hostium procul visus est , qui agmen Vercingetorigis antecesserat Quem simul atque oppidani conspexerunt atque in spem auxili venerunt , clamore sublato arma capere , portas claudere , murum complere coeperunt . <end>$$A part of the hostages being now delivered up , when the rest of the terms were being performed , a few centurions and soldiers being sent into the town to collect the arms and horses , the enemy's cavalry which had outstripped the main body of Vercingetorix's army , was seen at a distance ; as soon as the townsmen beheld them , and entertained hopes of assistance , raising a shout , they began to take up arms , shut the gates , and line the walls .
<start> Centuriones in oppido , cum ex significatione Gallorum novi aliquid ab eis iniri consili intellexissent , gladiis destrictis portas occupaverunt suosque omnes incolumes receperunt . <end>$$When the centurions in the town understood from the signal-making of the Gauls that they were forming some new design , they drew their swords and seized the gates , and recovered all their men safe .
<start> Caesar ex castris equitatum educi iubet , proelium equestre committit : laborantibus iam suis Germanos equites circiter CCCC summittit , quos ab initio habere secum instituerat . <end>$$Caesar orders the horse to be drawn out of the camp , and commences a cavalry action His men being now distressed , Caesar sends to their aid about four hundred German horse , which he had determined , at the beginning , to keep with himself .
<start> Eorum impetum Galli sustinere non potuerunt atque in fugam coniecti multis amissis se ad agmen receperunt . <end>$$The Gauls could not withstand their attack , but were put to flight , and retreated to their main body , after losing a great number of men .
<start> Quibus profligatis rursus oppidani perterriti comprehensos eos , quorum opera plebem concitatam existimabant , ad Caesarem perduxerunt seseque ei dediderunt . <end>$$When they were routed , the townsmen , again intimidated , arrested those persons by whose exertions they thought that the mob had been roused , and brought them to Caesar , and surrendered themselves to him .
<start> Quibus rebus confectis , Caesar ad oppidum Avaricum , quod erat maximum munitissimumque in finibus Biturigum atque agri fertilissima regione , profectus est , quod eo oppido recepto civitatem Biturigum se in potestatem redacturum confidebat . <end>$$When these affairs were accomplished , Caesar marched to the Avaricum , which was the largest and best fortified town in the territories of the Bituriges , and situated in a most fertile tract of country ; because he confidently expected that on taking that town , he would reduce beneath his dominion the state of the Bituriges .
<start> Vercingetorix tot continuis incommodis Vellaunoduni , Cenabi , Novioduni acceptis suos ad concilium convocat . <end>$$Vercingetorix , after sustaining such a series of losses at Vellaunodunum , Genabum , and Noviodunum , summons his men to a council .
<start> Docet longe alia ratione esse bellum gerendum atque antea gestum sit Omnibus modis huic rei studendum , ut pabulatione et commeatu Romani prohibeantur Id esse facile , quod equitatu ipsi abundent et quod anni tempore subleventur Pabulum secari non posse ; necessario dispersos hostes ex aedificiis petere : hos omnes cotidie ab equitibus deligi posse . <end>$$He impresses on them that the war must be prosecuted on a very different system from that which had been previously adopted ; but they should by all means aim at this object , that the Romans should be prevented from foraging and procuring provisions ; that this was easy , because they themselves were well supplied with cavalry , and were likewise assisted by the season of the year ; that forage could not be cut ; that the enemy must necessarily disperse , and look for it in the houses , that all these might be daily destroyed by the horse .
<start> Praeterea salutis causa rei familiaris commoda neglegenda : vicos atque aedificia incendi oportere hoc spatio ab via quoque versus , quo pabulandi causa adire posse videantur . <end>$$Besides that the interests of private property must be neglected for the sake of the general safety ; that the villages and houses ought to be fired , over such an extent of country in every direction from Boia , as the Romans appeared capable of scouring in their search for forage .
<start> Harum ipsis rerum copiam suppetere , quod , quorum in finibus bellum geratur , eorum opibus subleventur : Romanos aut inopiam non laturos aut magno periculo longius ab castris processuros ; neque interesse , ipsosne interficiant , impedimentisne exuant , quibus amissis bellum geri non possit . <end>$$That an abundance of these necessaries could be supplied to them , because they would be assisted by the resources of those in whose territories the war would be waged : that the Romans either would not bear the privation , or else would advance to any distance from the camp with considerable danger ; and that it made no difference whether they slew them or stripped them of their baggage , since , if it was lost , they could not carry on the war .
<start> Praeterea oppida incendi oportere , quae non munitione et loci natura ab omni sint periculo tuta , neu suis sint ad detractandam militiam receptacula neu Romanis proposita ad copiam commeatus praedamque tollendam . <end>$$Besides that , the towns ought to be burned which were not secured against every danger by their fortifications or natural advantages ; that there should not be places of retreat for their own countrymen for declining military service , nor be exposed to the Romans as inducements to carry off abundance of provisions and plunder .
<start> Haec si gravia aut acerba videautur , multo illa gravius aestimare , liberos , coniuges in servitutem abstrahi , ipsos interfici ; quae sit necesse accidere victis . <end>$$If these sacrifices should appear heavy or galling , that they ought to consider it much more distressing that their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery , and themselves slain ; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered .
<start> Omnium consensu hac sententia probata uno die amplius XX urbes Biturigum iucenduntur . <end>$$This opinion having been approved of by unanimous consent , more than twenty towns of the Bituriges are burned in one day .
<start> Hoc idem fit in reliquis civitatibus : in omnibus partibus incendia conspiciuntur ; quae etsi magno cum dolore omnes ferebant , tamen hoc sibi solati proponebant , quod se prope explorata victoria celeriter amissa reciperaturos confidebant . <end>$$Conflagrations are beheld in every quarter ; and although all bore this with great regret , yet they laid before themselves this consolation , that , as the victory was certain , they could quickly recover their losses .
<start> Deliberatur de Avarico in communi concilio , incendi placeret an defendi . <end>$$There is a debate concerning Avaricum in the general council , whether they should decide , that it should be burned or defended .
<start> Procumbunt omnibus Gallis ad pedes Bituriges , ne pulcherrimam prope totius Galliae urbem , quae praesidio et ornamento sit civitati , suis manibus succendere cogerentur : facile se loci natura defensuros dicunt , quod prope ex omnibus partibus flumine et palude circumdata unum habeat et perangustum aditum . <end>$$The Bituriges threw themselves at the feet of all the Gauls , and entreat that they should not be compelled to set fire with their own hands to the fairest city of almost the whole of Gaul , which was both a protection and ornament to the state ; they say that they could easily defend it , owing to the nature of the ground , for , being inclosed almost on every side by a river and a marsh , it had only one entrance , and that very narrow .
<start> Datur petentibus venia dissuadente primo Vercingetorige , post concedente et precibus ipsorum et misericordia vulgi . <end>$$Permission being granted to them at their earnest request , Vercingetorix at first dissuades them from it , but afterward concedes the point , owing to their entreaties and the compassion of the soldiers .
<start> Defensores oppido idonei deliguntur . <end>$$A proper garrison is selected for the town .
<start> Vercingetorix minoribus Caesarem itineribus subsequitur et locum castris deligit paludibus silvisque munitum ab Avarico longe milia passuum XVI . <end>$$Vercingetorix follows closely upon Caesar by shorter marches , and selects for his camp a place defended by woods and marshes , at the distance of fifteen miles from Avaricum .
<start> Ibi per certos exploratores in singula diei tempora quae ad Avaricum agerentur cognoscebat et quid fieri vellet imperabat Omnes nostras pabulationes frumentationesque observabat dispersosque , cum longius necessario procederent , adoriebatur magnoque incommodo adficiebat , etsi , quantum ratione provideri poterat , ab nostris occurrebatur , ut incertis temporibus diversisque itineribus iretur . <end>$$There he received intelligence by trusty scouts , every hour in the day , of what was going on at Avaricum , and ordered whatever he wished to be done ; he closely watched all our expeditions for corn and forage , and whenever they were compelled to go to a greater distance , he attacked them when dispersed , and inflicted severe loss upon them ; although the evil was remedied by our men , as far as precautions could be taken , by going forth at irregular times' and by different ways .
<start> Castris ad eam partem oppidi positis Caesar , quae intermissa flumine et a paludibus aditum , ut supra diximus , angustum habebat , aggerem apparare , vineas agere , turres duas constituere coepit : nam circumvallare loci natura prohibebat . <end>$$Caesar pitching his camp at that side of the town which was not defended by the river and marsh , and had a very narrow approach , as we have mentioned , began to raise the vineae and erect two towers : for the nature of the place prevented him from drawing a line of circumvallation .
<start> De re frumentaria Boios atque Aeduos adhortari non destitit ; quorum alteri , quod nullo studio agebant , non multum adiuvabant , alteri non magnis facultatibus , quod civitas erat exigua et infirma , celeriter quod habuerunt consumpserunt . <end>$$He never ceased to importune the Boii and Aedui for supplies of corn ; of whom the one , because they were acting with no zeal , did not aid him much ; the others , as their resources were not great , quickly consumed what they had .
<start> Summa difficultate rei frumentariae adfecto exercitu tenuitate Boiorum , indiligentia Aeduorum , incendiis aedificiorum , usque eo ut complures dies frumento milites caruerint et pecore ex longinquioribus vicis adacto extremam famem sustentarent , nulla tamen vox est ab eis audita populi Romani maiestate et superioribus victoriis indigna . <end>$$Although the army was distressed by the greatest want of corn , through the poverty of the Boii , the apathy of the Aedui , and the burning of the houses , to such a degree , that for several days the soldiers were without corn , and satisfied their extreme hunger with cattle driven from the remote villages ; yet no language was heard from them unworthy of the majesty of the Roman people and their former victories .
<start> Quin etiam Caesar cum in opere singulas legiones appellaret et , si acerbius inopiam ferrent , se dimissurum oppugnationem diceret , universi ab eo , ne id faceret , petebant : sic se complures anuos illo imperante meruisse , ut nullam ignominiam acciperent , nusquam infecta re discederent : hoc se ignominiae laturos loco , si inceptam oppugnationem reliquissent : praestare omnes perferre acerbitates , quam non civibus Romanis , qui Cenabi perfidia Gallorum interissent , parentarent . <end>$$Moreover , when Caesar addressed the legions , one by one , when at work , and said that he would raise the siege , if they felt the scarcity too severely , they unanimously begged him not to do so ; that they had served for several years under his command in such a manner that they never submitted to insult , and never abandoned an enterprise without accomplishing it ; that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned the siege after commencing it ; that it was better to endure every hardship than to not avenge the names of the Roman citizens who perished at Genabum by the perfidy of the Gauls .
<start> Haec eadem centurionibus tribunisque militum mandabant , ut per eos ad Caesarem deferrentur . <end>$$They intrusted the same declarations to the centurions and military tribunes , that through them they might be communicated to Caesar .
<start> Cum iam muro turres appropinquassent , ex captivis Caesar cognovit Vercingetorigem consumpto pabulo castra movisse propius Avaricum atque ipsum cum equitatu expeditisque , qui inter equites proeliari consuessent , insidiarum causa eo profectum , quo nostros postero die pabulatum venturos arbitraretur . <end>$$When the towers had now approached the walls , Caesar ascertained from the captives that Vercingetorix after destroying the forage , had pitched his camp nearer Avaricum , and that he himself with the cavalry and light-armed infantry , who generally fought among the horse , had gone to lay an ambuscade in that quarter , to which he thought that our troops would come the next day to forage .
<start> Illi celeriter per exploratores adventu Caesaris cognito carros impedimentaque sua in artiores silvas abdiderunt , copias omnes in loco edito atque aperto instruxerunt . <end>$$On learning these facts , he set out from the camp secretly at midnight , and reached the camp of the enemy early in the morning .
<start> Collis erat leniter ab infimo acclivis Hunc ex omnibus fere partibus palus difficilis atque impedita cingebat non latior pedibus quinquaginta . <end>$$There was a hill of a gentle ascent from the bottom ; a dangerous and impassable marsh , not more than fifty feet broad , begirt it on almost every side .
<start> Hoc se colle interruptis pontibus Galli fiducia loci continebant generatimque distributi in civitates omnia vada ac saltus eius paludis obtinebant sic animo parati , ut , si eam paludem Romani perrumpere conarentur , haesitantes premerent ex loco superiore ; ut qui propinquitatem loci videret paratos prope aequo Marte ad dimicandum existimaret , qui iniqui tatem condicionis perspiceret inani simulatione sese ostentare cognosceret . <end>$$The Gauls , having broken down the bridges , posted themselves on this hill , in confidence of their position , and being drawn up in tribes according to their respective states , held all the fords and passages of that marsh with trusty guards , thus determined that if the Romans should attempt to force the marsh , they would overpower them from the higher ground while sticking in it , so that whoever saw the nearness of the position , would imagine that the two armies were prepared to fight on almost equal terms ; but whoever should view accurately the disadvantage of position , would discover that they were showing off an empty affectation of courage .
<start> Indignantes milites Gaesar , quod conspectum suum hostes perferre possent tantulo spatio interiecto , et signum proeli exposcentes edocet , quanto detrimento et quot virorum tortium morte necesse sit constare victoriam ; quos cum sic animo paratos videat , ut nullum pro sua laude periculum recusent , summae se iniquitatis condemnari debere , nisi eorum vitam sua salute habeat cariorem . <end>$$Caesar clearly points out to his soldiers , who were indignant that the enemy could bear the sight of them at the distance of so short a space , and were earnestly demanding the signal for action , with how great loss and the death of how many gallant men the victory would necessarily be purchased : and when he saw them so determined to decline no danger for his renown , that he ought to be considered guilty of the utmost injustice if he did not hold their life dearer than his personal safety .
<start> Sic milites consolatus eodem die reducit in castra reliquaque quae ad oppugnationem pertinebant oppidi administrare instituit . <end>$$Having thus consoled his soldiers , he leads them back on the same day to the camp , and determined to prepare the other things which were necessary for the siege of the town .
<start> Vereingetorix , cum ad suos redisset , proditionis insimulatus , quod castra propius Romanos movisset , quod cum omni equitatu discessisset , quod sine imperio tantas copias reliquisset , quod eius discessu Romani tanta opportunitate et celeritate venissent : non haec omnia fortuito aut sine consilio accidere potuisse ; regnum illum Galliae malle Caesaris concessu quam ipsorum habere beneficio--tali modo accusatus ad haec respondit : Quod castra movisset , factum inopia pabuli etiam ipsis hortantibus ; quod propius Romanos accessisset , persuasum loci opportunitate , qui se ipsum munitione defenderet : equitum vero operam neque in loco palustri desiderari debuisse et illic fuisse utilem , quo sint profecti . <end>$$Vercingetorix , when he had returned to his men , was accused of treason , in that he had moved his camp nearer the Romans , in that he had gone away with all the cavalry , in that he had left so great forces without a commander , in that , on his departure , the Romans had come at such a favorable season , and with such dispatch ; that all these circumstances could not have happened accidentally or without design ; that he preferred holding the sovereignty of Gaul by the grant of Caesar to acquiring it by their favor .
<start> Summam imperi se consulto nulli discedentem tradidisse , ne is multitudinis studio ad dimicandum impelleretur ; cui rei propter animi mollitiem studere omnes videret , quod diutius laborem ferre non possent Romani si casu intervenerint , fortunae , si alicuius indicio vocati , huic habendam gratiam , quod et paucitatem eorum ex loco superiore cognoscere et virtutem despicere potuerint , qui dimicare non ausi turpiter se in castra receperint . <end>$$Being accused in such a manner , he made the following reply to these charges : -That his moving his camp had been caused by want of forage , and had been done even by their advice ; that his approaching near the Romans had been a measure dictated by the favorable nature of the ground , which would defend him by its natural strength ; that the service of the cavalry could not have been requisite in marshy ground , and was useful in that place to which they had gone ; that he , on his departure , had given the supreme command to no one intentionally , lest he should be induced by the eagerness of the multitude to hazard an engagement , to which he perceived that all were inclined , owing to their want of energy , because they were unable to endure fatigue any longer .
<start> Imperium se ab Caesare per proditionem nullum desiderare , quod habere victoria posset , quae iam esset sibi atque omnibus Gallis explorata : quin etiam ipsis remittere , si sibi magis honorem tribuere , quam ab se salutem accipere videantur . <end>$$That , if the Romans in the mean time came up by chance , they should feel grateful to fortune ; if invited by the information of some one they should feel grateful to him , because they were enabled to see distinctly from the higher ground the smallness of the number of their enemy , and despise the courage of those who , not daring to fight , retreated disgracefully into their camp .
<start> Hi iam ante edocti quae interrogati pronuntiarent , milites se esse legionarios dicunt ; fame et inopia adductos clam ex castris exisse , si quid frumenti aut pecoris in agris reperire possent : simili omnem exercitum inopia premi , nec iam vires sufficere cuiusquam nec ferre operis laborem posse : itaque statuisse imperatorem , si nihil in oppugnatione oppidi profecissent , triduo exercitum deducere . <end>$$They being previously instructed in what answers they should make when examined , say , That they were legionary soldiers , that , urged by famine and want , they had recently gone forth from the camp , if they could find any corn or cattle in the fields ; that the whole army was distressed by a similar scarcity , nor had any one now sufficient strength , nor could bear the labor of the work ; and therefore that the general was determined , if he made no progress in the siege , to draw off his army in three days .
<start> Haec , inquit , a me , Vercingetorix , beneficia habetis , quem proditionis insimulatis ; cuius opera sine vestro sanguine tantum exercitum victorem fame consumptum videtis ; quem turpiter se ex fuga recipientem ne qua civitas suis finibus recipiat a me provisum est . <end>$$These benefits , says Vercingetorix , you receive from me , whom you accuse of treason-me , by whose exertions you see so powerful and victorious an army almost destroyed by famine , without shedding one drop of your blood ; and I have taken precautions that no state shall admit within its territories this army in its ignominious flight from this place .
<start> Conclamat omnis multitudo et suo more armis concrepat , quod facere in eo consuerunt cuius orationem approbant : summum esse Vercingetorigem ducem , nec de eius fide dubitandum , nec maiore ratione bellum administrari posse . <end>$$The whole multitude raise a shout and clash their arms , according to their custom , as they usually do in the case of him of whose speech they approve ; that Vercingetorix was a consummate general , and that they had no doubt of his honor ; that the war could not be conducted with greater prudence .
<start> Statuunt , ut X milia hominum delecta ex omnibus copiis in oppidum mittantur , nec solis Biturigibus communem salutem committendam censent , quod paene in eo , si id oppidum retinuissent , summam victoriae constare intellegebant . <end>$$They determine that ten thousand men should be picked out of the entire army and sent into the town , and decide that the general safety should not be intrusted to the Bituriges alone , because they were aware that the glory of the victory must rest with the Bituriges , if they made good the defense of the town .
<start> Singulari militum nostrorum virtuti consilia cuius que modi Gallorum occurrebant , ut est summae genus sollertiae atque ad omnia imitanda et efficienda , quae ab quoque traduntur , aptissimum Nam et laqueis falces avertebant , quas , cum destinaverant , tormentis introrsus reducebant , et aggerem cuniculis subtrahebant , eo scientius quod apud eos magnae sunt ferrariae atque omne genus cuniculorum notum atque usitatum est . <end>$$To the extraordinary valor of our soldiers , devices of every sort were opposed by the Gauls ; since they are a nation of consummate ingenuity , and most skillful in imitating and making those things which are imparted by any one ; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses , and when they had caught hold of them firmly , drew them on by means of engines , and undermined the mound the more skillfully on this account , because there are in their territories extensive iron mines , and consequently every description of mining operations is known and practiced by them .
<start> Totum autem murum ex omni parte turribus contabulaverant atque has coriis intexerant . <end>$$They had furnished , more over , the whole wall on every side with turrets , and had covered them with skins .
<start> Tum crebris diurnis nocturnisque eruptionibus aut aggeri ignem inferebant aut milites occupatos in opere adoriebantur , et nostrarum turrium altitudinem , quantum has cotidianus agger expresserat , commissis suarum turrium malis adaequabant , et apertos cuniculos praeusta et praeacuta materia et pice fervefacta et maximi ponderis saxis morabantur moenibusque appropinquare prohibebant . <end>$$Besides , in their frequent sallies by day and night , they attempted either to set fire to the mound , or attack our soldiers when engaged in the works ; and , moreover , by splicing the upright timbers of their own towers , they equaled the height of ours , as fast as the mound had daily raised them , and countermined our mines , and impeded the working of them by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends , and boiling pitch and stones of very great weight , and prevented them from approaching the walls .
<start> Muri autem omnes Gallici hac fere forma sunt . <end>$$But this is usually the form of all the Gallic walls .
<start> Trabes derectae perpetuae in longitudinem paribus iutervallis , distantes inter se binos pedes , in solo collocantur . <end>$$Straight beams , connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal intervals , are placed together on the ground ; these are mortised on the inside , and covered with plenty of earth .
<start> Hae revinciuntur introrsus et multo aggere vestiuntur : ea autem , quae diximus , inter valla grandibus in fronte saxis effarciuntur . <end>$$But the intervals which we have mentioned , are closed up in front by large stones .
<start> His collocatis et coagmentatis alius insuper ordo additur , ut idem illud intervallum servetur neque inter se contingaut trabes , sed paribus intermissae spatiis singulae singulis saxis interiectis arte contineantur . <end>$$These being thus laid and cemented together , another row is added above , in such a manner , that the same interval may be observed , and that the beams may not touch one another , but equal spaces intervening , each row of beams is kept firmly in its place by a row of stones .
<start> Sic deinceps omne opus contexitur , dum iusta muri altitudo expleatur . <end>$$In this manner the whole wall is consolidated , until the regular height of the wall be completed .
<start> Hoc cum in speciem varietatemque opus deforme non est alternis trabibus ac saxis , quae rectis lineis suos ordines servant , tum ad utilitatem et defensionem urbium summam habet opportunitatem , quod et ab incendio lapis et ab ariete materia defendit , quae perpetuis trabibus pedes quadragenos plerumque introrsus revincta neque perrumpi neque distrahi potest . <end>$$This work , with respect to appearance and variety , is not unsightly , owing to the alternate rows of beams and stones , which preserve their order in right lines ; and , besides , it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defense of cities ; for the stone protects it from fire , and the wood from the battering ram , since it being mortised in the inside with rows of beams , generally forty feet each in length , can neither be broken through nor torn asunder .
<start> His tot rebus impedita oppugnatione milites , cum toto tempore frigore et assiduis imbribus tardarentur , tamen continenti labore omnia haec superaverunt et diebus XXV aggerem latum pedes CCCXXX , altum pedes LXXX exstruxerunt . <end>$$The siege having been impeded by so many disadvantages , the soldiers , although they were retarded during the whole time by the mud , cold , and constant showers , yet by their incessant labor overcame all these obstacles , and in twenty-five days raised a mound three hundred and thirty feet broad and eighty feet high .
<start> Cum is murum hostium paene contingeret , et Caesar ad opus consuetudine excubaret milites que hortaretur , ne quod omnino tempus ab opere intermitteretur , paulo ante tertiam vigiliam est animadversum fumare aggerem , quem cuniculo hostes succenderant , eodemque tempore toto muro clamore sublato duabus portis ab utroque latere turrium eruptio fiebat , alii faces atque aridam materiem de muro in aggerem eminus iaciebant , picem reliquasque res , quibus ignis excitari potest , fundebant , ut quo primum curreretur aut cui rei ferretur auxilium vix ratio iniri posset . <end>$$Some at a distance were casting torches and dry wood from the wall on the mound , others were pouring on it pitch , and other materials , by which the flame might be excited , so that a plan could hardly be formed , as to where they should first run to the defense , or to what part aid should be brought .
<start> Cum in omnibus locis consumpta iam reliqua parte noctis pugnaretur , semperque hostibus spes victoriae redintegraretur , eo magis , quod deustos pluteos turrium videbant nec facile adire apertos ad auxiliandum animadvertebant , semperque ipsi recentes defessis succederent omnemque Galliae salutem in illo vestigio temporis positam arbitrarentur , accidit inspectantibus nobis quod dignum memoria visum praetereundum non existimavimus . <end>$$When the battle was going on in every direction , the rest of the night being now spent , and fresh hopes of victory always arose before the enemy : the more so on this account because they saw the coverings of our towers burnt away , and perceived , that we , being exposed , could not easily go to give assistance , and they themselves were always relieving the weary with fresh men , and considered that all the safety of Gaul rested on this crisis ; there happened in my own view a circumstance which , having appeared to be worthy of record , we thought it ought not to be omitted .
<start> Quidam ante portam oppidi Gallus per manus sebi ac picis traditas glebas in ignem e regione turris proiciebat : scorpione ab latere dextro traiectus exanimatusque concidit . <end>$$A certain Gaul before the gate of the town , who was casting into the fire opposite the turret balls of tallow and fire which were passed along to him , was pierced with a dart on the right side and fell dead .
<start> Hunc ex proximis unus iacentem transgressus eodem illo munere fungebatur ; eadem ratione ictu scorpionis exanimato alteri successit tertius et tertio quartus , nec prius ille est a propugnatoribus vacuus relictus locus quam restincto aggere atque omni ex parte summotis hostibus finis est pugnandi factus . <end>$$One of those next him stepped over him as he lay , and discharged the same office : when the second man was slain in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow , a third succeeded him , and a fourth succeeded the third : nor was this post left vacant by the besieged , until , the fire of the mound having been extinguished , and the enemy repulsed in every direction , an end was put to the fighting .
<start> Omnia experti Galli , quod res nulla successerat , postero die consilium ceperunt ex oppido profugere hortante et iubente Vercingetorige . <end>$$The Gauls having tried every expedient , as nothing had succeeded , adopted the design of fleeing from the town the next day , by the advice and order of Vercingetorix .
<start> Id silentio noctis conati non magna iactura suorum sese effecturos sperabant , propterea quod neque longe ab oppido castra Vercingetorigis aberant , et palus , quae perpetua intercedebat , Romanos ad insequendum tardabat . <end>$$They hoped that , by attempting it at the dead of night , they would effect it without any great loss of men , because the camp of Vercingetorix was not far distant from the town , and the extensive marsh which intervened , was likely to retard the Romans in the pursuit .
<start> Iamque hoc facere noctu apparabant , cum matres familiae repente in publicum procurrerunt flentesque proiectae ad pedes suorum omnibus precibus petierunt , ne se et communes liberos hostibus ad supplicium dederent , quos ad capiendam fugam naturae et virium infirmitas impediret . <end>$$And they were now preparing to execute this by night , when the matrons suddenly ran out-into the streets , and weeping cast themselves at the feet of their husbands , and requested of them , with every entreaty , that they should not abandon themselves and their common children to the enemy for punishment , because the weakness of their nature and physical powers prevented them from taking to flight .
<start> Vbi eos in sententia perstare viderunt , quod plerumque in summo periculo timor misericordiam non recipit , conclamare et significare de fuga Romanis coeperunt . <end>$$When they saw that they persisted in their resolution , they began to shout aloud , and give intelligence of their flight to the Romans .
<start> Quo timore perterriti Galli , ne ab equitatu Romanorum viae praeoccuparentur , consilio destiterunt . <end>$$The Gauls being intimidated by fear of this , lest the passes should be pre-occupied by the Roman cavalry , desisted from their design .
<start> Postero die Caesar promota turri perfectisque operibus quae facere instituerat , magno coorto imbre non inutilem hanc ad capiendum consilium tempestatem arbitratus est , quod paulo incautius custodias in muro dispositas videbat , suosque languidius in opere versari iussit et quid fieri vellet ostendit . <end>$$The next day Caesar , the tower being advanced , and the works which he had determined to raise being arranged , a violent storm arising , thought this no bad time for executing his designs , because he observed the guards arranged on the walls a little too negligently , and therefore ordered his own men to engage in their work more remissly , and pointed out what he wished to be done .
<start> Legionibusque intra vineas in occulto expeditis , cohortatus ut aliquando pro tantis laboribus fructum victoriae perciperent , eis qui primi murum ascendissent praemia proposuit militibusque signum dedit . <end>$$He proposed a reward for those who should first scale the walls , and gave the signal to the soldiers .
<start> Hostes re nova perterriti muro turribusque deiecti in foro ac locis patentioribus cuneatim constiterunt , hoc animo ut si qua ex parte obviam contra veniretur acie instructa depugnarent . <end>$$The enemy being alarmed by the suddenness of the attack , were dislodged from the wall and towers , and drew up , in form of a wedge , in the market place and the open streets , with this intention that , if an attack should be made on any side , they should fight with their line drawn up to receive it .
<start> Vbi neminem in aequum loeum sese demittere , sed toto undique muro circum fundi viderunt , veriti ne omnino spes fugae tolleretur , abiectis armis ultimas oppidi partes continenti impetu petiverunt , parsque ibi , cum angusto exitu portarum se ipsi premerent , a militibus , pars iam egressa portis ab equitibus est interfecta ; nec fuit quisquam , qui praedae studeret . <end>$$When they saw no one descending to the level ground , and the enemy extending themselves along the entire wall in every direction , fearing lest every hope of flight should be cut off , they cast away their arms , and sought , without stopping , the most remote parts of the town .
<start> Denique ex omni numero , qui fuit circiter milium XL , vix DCCC , qui primo clamore audito se ex oppido eiecerunt , incolumes ad Vercingetorigem pervenerunt . <end>$$Thus , being excited by the massacre at Genabum and the fatigue of the siege , they spared neither those worn out with years , women , or children .
<start> Quos ille multa iam nocte silentio ex fuga excepit , veritus ne qua in castris ex eorum concursu et misericordia vulgi seditio oreretur , ut procul in via dispositis familiaribus suis principibusque civitatum disparandos deducendosque ad suos curaret , quae cuique civitati pars eastrorum ab initio obvenerat . <end>$$Finally , out of all that number , which amounted to about forty thousand , scarcely eight hundred , who fled from the town when they heard the first alarm , reached Vercingetorix in safety : and he , the night being now far spent , received them in silence after their flight , so that , having arranged his friends and the chiefs of the states at a distance on the road , he took precautions that they should be separated and conducted to their fellow countrymen , to whatever part of the camp had been assigned to each state from the beginning .
<start> Fuit haec oratio non ingrata Gallis , et maxime , quod ipse animo non defecerat tanto accepto incommodo neque se in occultum abdiderat et conspectum multitudinis fugerat ; plusque animo providere et praesentire existimabatur , quod re integra primo incendendum Avaricum , post deserendum censuerat . <end>$$This speech was not disagreeable to the Gauls , principally , because he himself was not disheartened by receiving so severe a loss , and had not concealed himself , nor shunned the eyes of the people : and he was believed to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than the rest , because , when the affair was undecided , he had at first been of opinion that Avaricum should be burnt , and afterward that it should be abandoned .
<start> Itaque ut reliquorum imperatorum res adversae auctoritatem minuunt , sic huius ex contrario dignitas incommodo accepto in dies augebatur Simul in spem veniebant eius adfirmatione de reliquis adiungendis civitatibus ; primumque eo tempore Galli castra munire instituerunt et sic sunt animo confirmati , homines insueti laboris , ut omnia quae imperarentur sibi patienda existimarent . <end>$$Accordingly , as ill success weakens the authority of other generals , so , on the contrary , his dignity increased daily , although a loss was sustained : at the same time they began to entertain hopes , on his assertion , of uniting the rest of the states to themselves , and on this occasion , for the first time , the Gauls began to fortify their camps , and were so alarmed that although they were men unaccustomed to toil , yet they were of opinion that they ought to endure and suffer every thing which should be imposed upon them .
<start> Nec minus quam est pollicitus Vercingetorix animo laborabat ut reliquas civitates adiungeret , atque eas donis pollicitationibusque alliciebat . <end>$$Nor did Vercingetorix use less efforts than he had promised , to gain over the other states , and endeavored to entice their leaders by gifts and promises .
<start> Huic rei idoneos homines deligebat , quorum quisque aut oratione sub dola aut amicitia facillime capere posset . <end>$$For this object he selected fitting emissaries , by whose subtle pleading or private friendship , each of the nobles could be most easily influenced .
<start> Qui Avarico expugnato refugerant , armandos vestiendosque curat ; simul , ut deminutae copiae redintegrarentur , imperat certum numerum militum civitatibus , quem et quam ante diem in castra adduci velit , sagittariosque omnes , quorum erat permagnus numerus in Gallia , conquiri et ad se mitti iubet . <end>$$He takes care that those who fled to him on the storming of Avaricum should be provided with arms and clothes At the same time that his diminished forces should be recruited , he levies a fixed quota of soldiers from each state , and defines the number and day before which he should wish them brought to the camp , and orders all the archers , of whom there was a very great number in Gaul , to be collected and sent to him .
<start> His rebus celeriter id quod Avarici deperierat expletur . <end>$$By these means , the troops which were lost at Avaricum are speedily replaced .
<start> Interim Teutomatus , Olloviconis filius , rex Nitiobrigum , cuius pater ab senatu nostro amicus erat appellatus , cum magno equitum suorum numero et quos ex Aquitania conduxerat ad eum pervenit . <end>$$In the mean time , Teutomarus , the son of Ollovicon , the king of the Nitiobriges , whose father had received the appellation of friend from our senate , came to him with a great number of his own horse and those whom he had hired from Aquitania .
<start> Caesar Avarici complures dies commoratus summamque ibi copiam frumenti et reliqui commeatus nactus exercitum ex labore atque inopia refecit . <end>$$Caesar , after delaying several days at Avaricum , and , finding there the greatest plenty of corn and other provisions , refreshed his army after their fatigue and privation .
<start> Iam prope hieme confecta cum ipso anni tempore ad gerendum bellum vocaretur et ad hostem proficisci constituisset , sive eum ex paludibus silvisque elicere sive obsidione premere posset , legati ad eum principes Aeduorum veniunt oratum ut maxime necessario tempore civitati subveniat : Summo esse in periculo rem , quod , cum singuli magistratus antiquitus creari atque regiam potestatem annum obtinere consuessent , duo magistratum gerant et se uterque eorum legibus creatum esse dicat . <end>$$The winter being almost ended , when he was invited by the favorable season of the year to prosecute the war and march against the enemy , whether he could draw them from the marshes and woods , or else press them by a blockade ; some noblemen of the Aedui came to him as embassadors to entreat that in an extreme emergency he should succor their state ; that their affairs were in the utmost danger , because , whereas single magistrates had been usually appointed in ancient times and held the power of king for a single year , two persons now exercised this office , and each asserted that he was appointed according to their laws .
<start> Horum esse alterum Convictolitavem , florentem et illustrem adulescentem , alterum Cotum , antiquissima familia natum atque ipsum hominem summae potentiae et magnae cognationis , cuius frater Valetiacus proximo anno eundem magistratum gesserit . <end>$$That one of them was Convictolitanis , a powerful and illustrious youth ; the other Cotus , sprung from a most ancient family , and personally a man of very great influence and extensive connections .
<start> Civitatem esse omnem in armis ; divisum senatum , divisum populum , suas cuiusque eorum clientelas Quod si diutius alatur controversia , fore uti pars cum parte civitatis confligat Id ne accidat , positum in eius diligentia atque auctoritate . <end>$$His brother Valetiacus had borne the same office during the last year : that the whole state was up in arms ; the senate divided , the people divided ; that each of them had his own adherents ; and that , if the animosity would be fomented any longer , the result would be that one part of the state would come to a collision with the other ; that it rested with his activity and influence to prevent it .
<start> Caesar , etsi a bello atque hoste discedere detrimentosum esse existimabat , tamen non ignorans quanta ex dissensionibus incommoda oriri consuessent , ne tanta et tam coniuncta populo Romano civitas , quam ipse semper aluisset omnibusque rebus ornasset , ad vim atque arma descenderet , atque ea pars quae minus sibi confideret auxilia a Vercingetorige arcesseret , huic rei praevertendum existimavit et , quod legibus Aeduorum eis , qui summum magistra tum obtinerent , excedere ex finibus non liceret , ne quid de iure aut de legibus eorum deminuisse videretur , ipse in Aeduos proficisci statuit senatumque omnem et quos inter controversia esset ad se Decetiam evocavit . <end>$$Although Caesar considered it ruinous to leave the war and the enemy , yet , being well aware what great evils generally arise from internal dissensions , lest a state so powerful and so closely connected with the Roman people , which he himself had always fostered and honored in every respect , should have recourse to violence and arms , and that the party which had less confidence in its own power should summon aid from Vercingetorix , he determined to anticipate this movement ; and because , by the laws of the Aedui , it was not permitted those who held the supreme authority to leave the country , he determined to go in person to the Aedui , lest he should appear to infringe upon their government and laws , and summoned all the senate , and those between whom the dispute was , to meet him at Decetia .
<start> Cum prope omnis civitas eo convenisset , docereturque paucis clam convocatis alio loco , alio tempore atque oportuerit fratrem a fratre renuntiatum , cum leges duo ex una familia vivo utroque non solum magistratus creari vetarent , sed etiam in senatu esse prohiberent , Cotum imperium deponere coegit , Convictolitavem , qui per sacerdotes more civitatis intermissis magistratibus esset creatus , potestatem obtinere iussit . <end>$$When almost all the state had assembled there , and he was informed that one brother had been declared magistrate by the other , when only a few persons were privately summoned for the purpose , at a different time and place from what he ought , whereas the laws not only forbade two belonging to one family to be elected magistrates while each was alive , but even deterred them from being in the senate , he compelled Cotus to resign his office ; he ordered Convictolitanis , who had been elected by the priests , according to the usage of the state , in the presence of the magistrates , to hold the supreme authority .
<start> Hoc decreto interposito cohortatus Aeduos , ut controversiarum ac dissensionis obliviscerentur atque omnibus omissis his rebus huic bello servirent eaque quae meruissent praemia ab se devicta Gallia exspectarent equitatumque omnem et peditum milia decem sibi celeriter mitterent , quae in praesidiis rei frumentariae causa disponeret , exercitum in duas partes divisit : quattuor legiones in Senones Parisiosque Labieno ducendas dedit , sex ipse in Arvernos ad oppidum Gergoviam secundum flumen Elaver duxit ; equitatus partem illi attribuit , partem sibi reliquit . <end>$$Having pronounced this decree between , he exhorted the Aedui to bury in oblivion their disputes and dissensions , and , laying aside all these things , devote themselves to the war , and expect from him , on the conquest of Gaul , those rewards which they should have earned , and send speedily to him all their cavalry and ten thousand infantry , which he might place in different garrisons to protect his convoys of provisions , and then divided his army into two parts : he gave Labienus four legions to lead into the country of the Senones and Parisii ; and led in person six into the country of the Arverni , in the direction of the town of Gergovia , along the banks of the Allier .
<start> Cum uterque utrimque exisset exercitus , in conspectu fereque e regione castris castra ponebant dispositis exploratoribus , necubi effecto ponte Romani copias traducerent Erat in magnis Caesaris difficultatibus res , ne maiorem aestatis partem flumine impediretur , quod non fere ante autumnum Elaver vado transiri solet . <end>$$When each army was in sight of the other , and was pitching their camp almost opposite that of the enemy , scouts being distributed in every quarter , lest the Romans should build a bridge and bring over their troops ; it was to Caesar a matter attended with great difficulties , lest he should be hindered from passing the river during the greater part of the summer , as the Allier can not generally be forded before the autumn .
<start> Itaque , ne id accideret , silvestri loco castris positis e regione unius eorum pontium , quos Vercingetorix rescindendos curaverat , postero die cum duabus legionibus in occulto restitit ; reliquas copias cum omnibus impedimentis , ut consueverat , misit , apertis quibusdam cohortibus , uti numerus legionum constare videretur . <end>$$Therefore , that this might not happen , having pitched his camp in a woody place opposite to one of those bridges which Vercingetorix had taken care should be broken down , the next day he stopped behind with two legions in a secret place ; he sent on the rest of the forces as usual , with all the baggage , after having selected some cohorts , that the number of the legions might appear to be complete .
<start> His quam longissime possent egredi iussis , eum iam ex diei tempore coniecturam ceperat in castra perventum , isdem sublicis , quarum pars inferior integra remanebat , pontem reficere coepit . <end>$$Having ordered these to advance as far as they could , when now , from the time of day , he conjectured they had come to an encampment , he began to rebuild the bridge on the same piles , the lower part of which remained entire .
<start> Celeriter effecto opere legionibusque traductis et loco castris idoneo delecto reliquas copias revocavit . <end>$$Having quickly finished the work and led his legions across , he selected a fit place for a camp , and recalled the rest of his troops .
<start> Vercingetorix re cognita , ne contra suam voluntatem dimicare cogeretur , magnis itineribus antecessit . <end>$$Vercingetorix , on ascertaining this fact , went before him by forced marches , in order that he might not be compelled to come to an action against his will .
<start> Caesar ex eo loco quintis castris Gergoviam pervenit equestrique eo die proelio levi facto perspecto urbis situ , quae posita in altissimo monte omnes aditus difficiles habebat , de expugnatione desperavit , de obsessione non prius agendum constituit , quam rem frumentariam expedisset . <end>$$Caesar , in five days' march , went from that place to Gergovia , and after engaging in a slight cavalry skirmish that day , on viewing the situation of the city , which , being built on a very high mountain , was very difficult of access , he despaired of taking it by storm , and determined to take no measures with regard to besieging it before he should secure a supply of provisions .
<start> At Vercingetorix castris , prope oppidum positis , mediocribus circum se intervallis separatim singularum civitatium copias collocaverat atque omnibus eius iugi collibus occupatis , qua despici poterat , horribilem speciem praebebat ; principesque earum civitatium , quos sibi ad consilium capiendum delegerat , prima luce cotidie ad se convenire iubebat , seu quid communicandum , seu quid administrandum videretur ; neque ullum fere diem intermittebat quin equestri proelio interiectis sagittariis , quid in quoque esset animi ac virtutis suorum perspiceret . <end>$$But Vercingetorix , having pitched his camp on the mountain near the town , placed the forces of each state separately and at small intervals around himself , and having occupied all the hills of that range as far as they commanded a view , he presented a formidable appearance ; he ordered the rulers of the states , whom he had selected as his council of war , to come to him daily at the dawn , whether any measure seemed to require deliberation or execution .
<start> Erat e regione oppidi collis sub ipsis radicibus montis , egregie munitus atque ex omni parte circumcisus ; quem si tenerent nostri , et aquae magna parte et pabulatione libera prohibituri hostes videbantur . <end>$$Nor did he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a cavalry action , the archers being intermixed , what spirit and valor there was in each of his own men .
<start> Sed is locus praesidio ab his non nimis firmo tenebatur Tamen silentio noctis Caesar ex castris egressus , priusquam subsidio ex oppido veniri posset , deiecto praesidio potitus loco duas ibi legiones collocavit fossamque duplicem duodenum pedum a maioribus castris ad minora perduxit , ut tuto ab repentino hostium incursu etiam singuli commeare possent . <end>$$There was a hill opposite the town , at the very foot of that mountain , strongly fortified and precipitous on every side : however , Caesar set out from the camp in the silence of night , and dislodging the garrison before succor could come from the town , he got possession of the place and posted two legions there , and drew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet broad , so that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any sudden attack of the enemy .
<start> Dum haec ad Gergoviam geruntur , Convictolitavis Aeduus , cui magistratum adiudicatum a Caesare demonstravimus , sollicitatus ab Arvernis pecunia cum quibusdam adulescentibus colloquitur ; quorum erat princeps Litaviccus atque eius fratres , amplissima familia nati adulescentes . <end>$$While these affairs were going on at Gergovia , Convictolanis , the Aeduan , to whom we have observed the magistracy was adjudged by Caesar , being bribed by the Arverni , holds a conference with certain young men , the chief of whom were Litavicus and his brothers , who were born of a most noble family .
<start> Cum his praemium communicat hortaturque , ut se liberos et imperio natos meminerint Vnam esse Aeduorum civitatem , quae certissimam Galliae victoriam detineat ; eius auctoritate reliquas contineri ; qua traducta locum consistendi Romanis in Gallia non fore Esse nonnullo se Caesaris beneficio adfectum , sic tamen , ut iustissimam apud eum causam obtinuerit ; sed plus communi libertati tribuere Cur enim potius Aedui de suo iure et de legibus ad Caesarem disceptatorem , quam Romani ad Aeduos veniant ? Celeriter adulescentibus et oratione magistratus et praemio deductis , cum se vel priucipes eius consili fore profiterentur , ratio perficiendi quaerebatur , quod civitatem temere ad suscipiendum bellum adduci posse non confidebant . <end>$$He shares the bribe with them , and exhorts them to remember that they were free and born for empire ; that the state of the Aedui was the only one which retarded the most certain victory of the Gauls ; that the rest were held in check by its authority ; and , if it was brought over , the Romans would not have room to stand on in Gaul ; that he had received some kindness from Caesar , only so far , however , as gaining a most just cause by his decision ; but that he assigned more weight to the general freedom ; for , why should the Aedui go to Caesar to decide concerning their rights and laws , rather than the Romans come to the Aedui ? The young men being easily won over by the speech of the magistrate and the bribe , when they declared that they would even be leaders in the plot , a plan for accomplishing it was considered , because they were confident their state could not be induced to undertake the war on slight grounds .
<start> Placuit ut Litaviccus decem illis milibus , quae Caesari ad bellum mitterentur , praeficeretur atque ea ducenda curaret , fratresque eius ad Caesarem praecurrerent . <end>$$It was resolved that Litavicus should have the command of the ten thousand , which were being sent to Caesar for the war , and should have charge of them on their march , and that his brothers should go before him to Caesar .
<start> Reliqua qua ratione agi placeat constituunt . <end>$$They arrange the other measures , and the manner in which they should have them done .
<start> Litaviccus accepto exercitu , cum milia passuum circiter XXX ab Gergovia abesset , convocatis subito militibus lacrimans , Quo proficiscimur , inquit , milites ? Omnis noster equitatus , omnis nobilitas interiit ; principes civitatis , Eporedorix et Viridomarus , insimulati proditionis ab Romanis indicta causa interfecti sunt . <end>$$Litavicus , having received the command of the army , suddenly convened the soldiers , when he was about thirty miles distant from Gergovia , and , weeping , said , Soldiers , whither are we going ? All our knights and all our nobles have perished .
<start> Haec ab ipsis cognoscite , qui ex ipsa caede fugerunt : nam ego fratribus atque omnibus meis propinquis interfectis dolore prohibeor , quae gesta sunt , pronuntiare . <end>$$Eporedirix and Viridomarus , the principal men of the state , being accused of treason , have been slain by the Romans without any permission to plead their cause .
<start> Producuntur hi quos ille edocuerat quae dici vellet , atque eadem , quae Litaviccus pronuntiaverat , multitudini exponunt : multos equites Aeduorum interfectos , quod collocuti cum Arvernis dicerentur ; ipsos se inter multitudinem militum occultasse atque ex media caede fugisse . <end>$$Learn this intelligence from those who have escaped from the massacre ; for I , since my brothers and all my relations have been slain , am prevented by grief from declaring what has taken place .
<start> Quasi vero , inquit ille , consili sit res , ac non necesse sit nobis Gergoviam contendere et cum Arvernis nosmet coniungere . <end>$$As if , said he , it were a matter of deliberation , and not of necessity , for us to go to Gergovia and unite ourselves to the Arverni .
<start> An dubitamus quin nefario facinore admisso Romani iam ad nos interficiendos concurrant ? Proinde , si quid in nobis animi est , persequamur eorum mortem qui indignissime interierunt , atque hos latrones interficiamus . <end>$$Or have we any reasons to doubt that the Romans , after perpetrating the atrocious crime , are now hastening to slay us ? Therefore , if there be any spirit in us , let us avenge the death of those who have perished in a most unworthy manner , and let us slay these robbers .
<start> Ostendit cives Romanos , qui eius praesidi fiducia una erant : magnum numerum frumenti commeatusque diripit , ipsos crudeliter excruciatos interficit . <end>$$He points to the Roman citizens , who had accompanied them , in reliance on his protection .
<start> Eporedorix Aeduus , summo loco natus adulescens et summae domi potentiae , et una Viridomarus , pari aetate et gratia , sed genere dispari , quem Caesar ab Diviciaeo sibi traditum ex humili loco ad summam dignitatem perduxerat , in equitum numero convenerant nominatim ab eo evocati . <end>$$Eporedirix , the Aeduan , a young man born in the highest rank and possessing very great influence at home , and , along with Viridomarus , of equal age and influence , but of inferior birth , whom Caesar had raised from a humble position to the highest rank , on being recommended to him by Divitiacus , had come in the number of horse , being summoned by Caesar by name .
<start> His erat inter se de principatu contentio , et in illa magistratuum controversia alter pro Convictolitavi , alter pro Coto summis opibus pugnaverant . <end>$$These had a dispute with each other for precedence , and in the struggle between the magistrates they had contended with their utmost efforts , the one for Convictolitanis , the other for Cotus .
<start> Ex eis Eporedorix cognito Litavicci consilio media fere noete rem ad Caesarem defert ; orat ne patiatur civitatem pravis adulescentium consiliis ab amicitia populi Romani deficere ; quod futurum provideat , si se tot hominum milia cum hostibus coniunxerint , quorum salutem neque propinqui neglegere , neque civitas levi momento aestimare posset . <end>$$Of these Eporedirix , on learning the design of Litavicus , lays the matter before Caesar almost at midnight ; he entreats that Caesar should not suffer their state to swerve from the alliance with the Roman people , owing to the depraved counsels of a few young men which he foresaw would be the consequence if so many thousand men should unite themselves to the enemy , as their relations could not neglect their safety , nor the state regard it as a matter of slight importance .
<start> Magna adfectus sollicitudine hoc nuntio Caesar , quod semper Aeduorum civitati praecipue indulserat , nulla interposita dubitatione legiones expeditas quattuor equitatumque omnem ex castris educit ; nec fuit spatium tali tempore ad contrahenda castra , quod res posita in celeritate videbatur ; Gaium Fabium legatum eum legionibus duabus castris praesidio relinquit . <end>$$Caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence , because he had always especially indulged the state of the Aedui , and , without any hesitation , draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all the cavalry : nor had he time , at such a crisis , to contract the camp , because the affair seemed to depend upon dispatch .
<start> Fratres Litavicci eum comprehendi iussisset , paulo ante reperit ad hostes fugisse . <end>$$He leaves Caius Fabius , his lieutenant , with two legions to guard the camp .
<start> Adhortatus milites , ne necessario tempore itineris labore per moveantur , cupidissimis omnibus progressus milia passuum XXV agmen Aeduorum conspicatus immisso equitatu iter eorum moratur atque impedit interdicitque omnibus ne quemquam interficiant . <end>$$When he ordered the brothers of Litavicus to be arrested , he discovers that they had fled a short time before to the camp of the enemy .
<start> His cognitis et Litavicci fraude perspecta Aedui manus tendere , deditionem significare et proiectis armis mortem deprecari incipiunt . <end>$$When they were recognized and the treachery of Litavicus discovered , the Aedui began to extend their hands to intimate submission , and , laying down their arms , to deprecate death .
<start> Litaviccus cum suis clientibus , quibus more Gallorum nefas est etiam in extrema fortuna deserere patronos , Gergoviam profugit . <end>$$Litavicus , with his clansmen , who after the custom of the Gauls consider it a crime to desert their patrons , even in extreme misfortune , flees forth to Gergovia .
<start> Caesar nuntiis ad civitatem Aeduorum missis , qui suo beneficio conservatos docerent quos iure belli interficere potuisset , tribusque horis noctis exercitui ad quietem datis castra ad Gergoviam movit . <end>$$Caesar , after sending messengers to the state of the Aedui , to inform them that they whom he could have put to death by the right of war were spared through his kindness , and after giving three hours of the night to his army for his repose , directed his march to Gergovia .
<start> Dum haec ad Gergoviam geruntur , Aedui primis nuntiis ab Litavicco acceptis nullum sibi ad cognoscendum spatium relinquunt . <end>$$While these things are going on at Gergovia , the Aedui , on receiving the first announcements from Litavicus , leave themselves no time to ascertain the truth of those statements .
<start> Impellit alios avaritia , alios iracundia et temeritas , quae maxime illi hominum generi est innata , ut levem auditionem habeant pro re comperta . <end>$$Some are stimulated by avarice , others by revenge and credulity , which is an innate propensity in that race of men to such a degree that they consider a slight rumor as an ascertained fact .
<start> Bona civium Romanorum diripiunt , caedes faciunt , in servitutem abstrahunt . <end>$$They plunder the property of the Roman citizens , and either massacre them or drag them away to slavery .
<start> Adiuvat rem proclinatam Convictolitavis plebemque ad furorem impellit , ut facinore admisso ad sanitatem reverti pudeat . <end>$$Convictolitanis increases the evil state of affairs , and goads on the people to fury , that by the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return to propriety .
<start> Marcum Aristium , tribunum militum , iter ad legionem facientem fide data ex oppido Cabillono educunt : idem facere cogunt eos , qui negotiandi causa ibi constiterant . <end>$$They entice from the town of Cabillonus , by a promise of safety , Marcus Aristius , a military tribune , who was on his march to his legion ; they compel those who had settled there for the purpose of trading to do the same .
<start> Hos continuo itinere adorti omnibus impedimentis exuunt ; repugnantes diem noctemque obsident ; multis utrimque interfectis maiorem multitudinem armatorum concitant . <end>$$By constantly attacking them on their march they strip them of all their baggage ; they besiege day and night those that resisted ; when many were slain on both sides , they excite a great number to arms .
<start> Interim nuntio allato omnes eorum milites in potestate Caesaris teneri , concurrunt ad Aristium , nihil publico factum consilio demonstrant ; quaestionem de bonis direptis decernunt , Litavicci fatrumque bona publicant , legatos ad Caesarem sui purgandi gratia mittunt . <end>$$In the mean time , when intelligence was brought that all their soldiers were in Caesar's power , they run in a body to Aristius ; they assure him that nothing had been done by public authority ; they order an inquiry to be made about the plundered property ; they confiscate the property of Litavicus and his brothers ; they send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of clearing themselves .
<start> Haec faciunt reciperandorum suorum causa ; sed contaminati facinore et capti compendio ex direptis bonis , quod ea res ad multos pertinebat , timore poenae exterriti consilia clam de bello inire incipiunt civitatesque reliquas legationibus sollicitant . <end>$$They do all this with a view to recover their soldiers ; but being contaminated by guilt , and charmed by the gains arising from the plundered property , as that act was shared in by many , and being tempted by the fear of punishment , they began to form plans of war and stir up the other states by embassies .
<start> Quae tametsi Caesar intellegebat , tamen quam mitissime potest legatos appellat : nihil se propter inscientiam levitatemque vulgi gravius de civitate iudicare neque de sua in Aeduos benevolentia deminuere . <end>$$Although Caesar was aware of this proceeding , yet he addresses the embassadors with as much mildness as he can : That he did not think worse of the state on account of the ignorance and fickleness of the mob , nor would diminish his regard for the Aedui .
<start> Ipse maiorem Galliae motum exspectans , ne ab omnibus civitatibus circumsisteretur , consilia inibat quemadmodum ab Gergovia discederet ac rursus omnem exercitum contraheret , ne profectio nata ab timore defectionis similis fugae videretur . <end>$$He himself , fearing a greater commotion in Gaul , in order to prevent his being surrounded by all the states , began to form plans as to the manner in which he should return from Gergovia and again concentrate his forces , lest a departure arising from the fear of a revolt should seem like a flight .
<start> Haec cogitanti accidere visa est facultas bene rei gerendae . <end>$$While he was considering these things an opportunity of acting successfully seemed to offer .
<start> Nam cum in minora castra operis perspiciendi causa venisset , animadvertit collem , qui ab hostibus tenebatur , nudatum hominibus , qui superioribus diebus vix prae multitudine cerni poterat . <end>$$For , when he had come into the smaller camp for the purpose of securing the works , he noticed that the hill in the possession of the enemy was stripped of men , although , on the former days , it could scarcely be seen on account of the numbers on it .
<start> Admiratus quaerit ex perfugis causam , quorum magnus ad eum cotidie numerus confluebat . <end>$$Being astonished , he inquires the reason of it from the deserters , a great number of whom flocked to him daily .
<start> Constabat inter omnes , quod iam ipse Caesar per exploratores cognoverat , dorsum esse eius iugi prope aequum , sed hunc silvestrem et angustum , qua esset aditus ad alteram partem oppidi ; huic loco vehementer illos timere nec iam aliter sentire , uno colle ab Romanis occupato , si alterum amisissent , quin paene circumvallati atque omni exitu et pabulatione interclusi viderentur : ad hunc muniendum omnes a Vercingetorige evocatos . <end>$$They all concurred in asserting , what Caesar himself had already ascertained by his scouts , that the back of that hill was almost level ; but likewise woody and narrow , by which there was a pass to the other side of the town ; that they had serious apprehensions for this place , and had no other idea , on the occupation of one hill by the Romans , than that , if they should lose the other , they would be almost surrounded , and cut off from all egress and foraging ; that they were all summoned by Vercingetorix to fortify this place .
<start> Hac re cognita Caesar mittit complures equitum turmas ; eis de media nocte imperat , ut paulo tumultuosius omnibus locis vagarentur . <end>$$Caesar , on being informed of this circumstance , sends several troops of horse to the place immediately after midnight ; he orders them to range in every quarter with more tumult than usual .
<start> Prima luce magnum numerum impedimentorum ex castris mulorumque produci deque his stramenta detrahi mulionesque cum cassidibus equitum specie ac simulatione collibus circumvehi iubet . <end>$$At dawn he orders a large quantity of baggage to be drawn out of the camp , and the muleteers with helmets , in the appearance and guise of horsemen , to ride round the hills .
<start> His paucos addit equites qui latius ostentationis causa vagarentur . <end>$$To these he adds a few cavalry , with instructions to range more widely to make a show .
<start> Longo circuitu easdem omnes iubet petere regiones Haec procul ex oppido videbantur , ut erat a Gergovia despectus in castra , neque tanto spatio certi quid esset explorari poterat . <end>$$He orders them all to seek the same quarter by a long circuit ; these proceedings were seen at a distance from the town , as Gergovia commanded a view of the camp , nor could the Gauls ascertain at so great a distance , what certainty there was in the maneuver .
<start> Legionem unam eodem iugo mittit et paulum progressam inferiore constituit loco silvisque occultat . <end>$$He sends one legion to the same hill , and after it had marched a little , stations it in the lower ground , and conceals it in the woods .
<start> Augetur Gallis suspicio , atque omnes illo ad munitionem copiae traducuntur . <end>$$The suspicion of the Gauls are increased , and all their forces are marched to that place to defend it .
<start> Vacua castra hostium Caesar conspicatus tectis insignibus suorum occultatisque signis militaribus raros milites , ne ex oppido animadverterentur , ex maioribus castris in minora traducit legatisque , quos singulis legionibus praefecerat , quid fieri velit ostendit : in primis monet ut contineant milites , ne studio pugnandi aut spe praedae longius progrediantur ; quid iniquitas loci habeat incommodi proponit : hoc una celeritate posse mutari ; occasionis esse rem , non proeli . <end>$$Caesar , having perceived the camp of the enemy deserted , covers the military insignia of his men , conceals the standards , and transfers his soldiers in small bodies from the greater to the less camp , and points out to the lieutenants whom he had placed in command over the respective legions , what he should wish to be done ; he particularly advises them to restrain their men from advancing too far , through their desire of fighting , or their hope of plunder , he sets before them what disadvantages the unfavorable nature of the ground carries with it ; that they could be assisted by dispatch alone : that success depended on a surprise , and not on a battle .
<start> His rebus expositis signum dat et ab dextra parte alio ascensu eodem tempore Aeduos mittit . <end>$$After stating these particulars , he gives the signal for action , and detaches the Aedui at the same time by another ascent on the right .
<start> Oppidi murus ab planitie atque initio ascensus recta regione , si nullus anfractus intercederet , MCC passus aberat : quidquid huc circuitus ad molliendum clivum accesserat , id spatium itineris augebat . <end>$$The town wall was 1200 paces distant from the plain and foot of the ascent , in a straight line , if no gap intervened ; whatever circuit was added to this ascent , to make the hill easy , increased the length of the route .
<start> A medio fere colle in longitudinem , ut natura montis ferebat , ex grandibus saxis sex pedum murum qui nostrorum impetum tardaret praeduxerant Galli , atque inferiore omni spatio vacuo relicto superiorem partem collis usque ad murum oppidi densissimis castris compleverant . <end>$$But almost in the middle of the hill , the Gauls had previously built a wall six feet high , made of large stones , and extending in length as far as the nature of the ground permitted , as a barrier to retard the advance of our men ; and leaving all the lower space empty , they had filled the upper part of the hill , as far as the wall of the town , with their camps very close to one another .
<start> Milites dato signo celeriter ad munitionem perveniunt eamque transgressi trinis castris potiuntur ; ac tanta fuit in castris capiendis celeritas , ut Teutomatus , rex Nitiobrigum , subito in tabernaculo oppressus , ut meridie conquieverat , superiore corporis parte nudata vulnerato equo vix se ex manibus praedantium militum eriperet . <end>$$The soldiers , on the signal being given , quickly advance to this fortification , and passing over it , make themselves masters of the separate camps And so great was their activity in taking the camps , that Teutomarus , the king of the Nitiobriges , being suddenly surprised in his tent , as he had gone to rest at noon , with difficulty escaped from the hands of the plunderers , with the upper part of his person naked , and his horse wounded .
<start> Consecutus id quod animo proposuerat , Caesar receptui cani iussit legionique decimae , quacum erat , continuo signa constituit . <end>$$Caesar , having accomplished the object which he had in view , ordered the signal to be sounded for a retreat ; and the soldiers of the tenth legion , by which he was then accompanied , halted .
<start> Sed elati spe celeris victoriae et hostium fuga et superiorum temporum secundis proeliis nihil adeo arduum sibi esse existimaverunt quod non virtute consequi possent , neque finem prius sequendi fecerunt quam muro oppidi portisque appropinquarunt . <end>$$The matrons begin to cast their clothes and silver over the wall , and bending over as far as the lower part of the bosom , with outstretched hands beseech the Romans to spare them , and not to sacrifice to their resentment even women and children , as they had done at Avaricum .
<start> Tum vero ex omnibus urbis partibus orto clamore , qui longius aberant repentino tumultu perterriti , cum hostem intra portas esse existimarent , sese ex oppido eiecerunt . <end>$$Some of them let themselves down from the walls by their hands , and surrendered to our soldiers .
<start> Matres familiae de muro vestem argentumque iactabant et pectore nudo prominentes passis manibus obtestabantur Romanos , ut sibi parcerent neu , sicut Avarici fecissent , ne a mulieribus quidem atque infantibus abstinerent : nonnullae de muris per manus demissae sese militibus tradebant . <end>$$Lucius Fabius a centurion of the eighth legion , who , it was ascertained , had said that day among his fellow soldiers that he was excited by the plunder of Avaricum , and would not allow any one to mount the wall before him , finding three men of his own company , and being raised up by them , scaled the wall .
<start> Interim ei qui ad alteram partem oppidi , ut supra demonstravimus , munitionis causa convenerant , primo exaudito clamore , inde etiam crebris nuntiis incitati , oppidum a Romanis teneri , praemissis equitibus magno concursu eo contenderunt . <end>$$In the mean time those who had gone to the other part of the town to defend it , as we have mentioned above , at first , aroused by hearing the shouts , and , afterward , by frequent accounts , that the town was in possession of the Romans , sent forward their cavalry , and hastened in larger numbers to that quarter .
<start> Eorum ut quisque primus venerat , sub muro consistebat suorumque pugnantium numerum augebat . <end>$$As each first came he stood beneath the wall , and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in action .
<start> Quorum cum magna multitudo convenisset , matres familiae , quae paulo ante Romanis de muro manus tendebant , suos obtestari et more Gallico passum capillum ostentare liberosque in conspectum proferre coeperunt . <end>$$When a great multitude of them had assembled , the matrons , who a little before were stretching their hands from the walls to the Romans , began to beseech their countrymen , and after the Gallic fashion to show their disheveled hair , and bring their children into public view .
<start> Erat Romanis nec loco nec numero aequa contentio ; simul et cursu et spatio pugnae defatigati non facile recentes atque integros sustinebant . <end>$$Neither in position nor in numbers was the contest an equal one to the Romans ; at the same time , being exhausted by running and the long continuation of the fight , they could not easily withstand fresh and vigorous troops .
<start> Caesar , cum iniquo loco pugnari hostiumque augeri copias videret , praemetuens suis ad Titum Sextium legatum , quem minoribus castris praesidio reliquerat , misit , ut cohortes ex castris celeriter educeret et sub infimo colle ab dextro latere hostium constitueret , ut , si nostros loco depulsos vidisset , quo minus libere hostes insequerentur terreret . <end>$$Caesar , when he perceived that his soldiers were fighting on unfavorable ground , and that the enemy's forces were increasing , being alarmed for the safety of his troops , sent orders to Titus Sextius , one of his lieutenants , whom he had left to guard the smaller camp , to lead out his cohorts quickly from the camp , and post them at the foot of the hill , on the right wing of the enemy ; that if he should see our men driven from the ground , he should deter the enemy from following too closely .
<start> Ipse paulum ex eo loco cum legione progressus , ubi constiterat , eventum pugnae exspectabat . <end>$$He himself , advancing with the legion a little from that place where he had taken his post , awaited the issue of the battle .
<start> Cum acerrime comminus pugnaretur , hostes loco et numero , nostri virtute confiderent , subito sunt Aedui nsi ab latere nostris aperto , quos Caesar ab dextra parte alio ascensu manus distinendae causa miserat . <end>$$While the fight was going on most vigorously , hand to hand , and the enemy depended on their position and numbers , our men on their bravery , the Aedui suddenly appeared on our exposed flank , as Caesar had sent them by another ascent on the right , for the sake of creating a diversion .
<start> Hi similitudine armorum vehementer nostros perterruerunt , ac tametsi dextris humeris ex sertis animadvertebantur , quod insigne pactum esse consuerat , tamen id ipsum sui fallendi causa milites ab hostibus factum existimabant . <end>$$These , from the similarity of their arms , greatly terrified our men ; and although they were discovered to have their right shoulders bare , which was usually the sign of those reduced to peace , yet the soldiers suspected that this very thing was done by the enemy to deceive them .
<start> Eodem tempore Lucius Fabius centurio quique una murum ascenderant circumventi atque interfecti muro praecipitabantur . <end>$$At the same time Lucius Fabius the centurion , and those who had scaled the wall with him , being surrounded and slain , were cast from the wall .
<start> Marcus Petronius , eiusdem legionis centurio , cum portam excidere conatus esset , a multitudine oppressus ac sibi desperans multis iam vulneribus acceptis manipularibus suis , qui illum secuti erant , Quoniam , inquit , me una vobiscum servare non possum , vestrae quidem certe vitae prospiciam , quos cupiditate gloriae adductus in periculum deduxi . <end>$$Marcus Petreius , a centurion of the same legion , after attempting to hew down the gates , was overpowered by numbers , and , despairing of his safety , having already received many wounds , said to the soldiers of his own company who followed him : Since I can not save you as well as myself , I shall at least provide for your safety , since I , allured by the love of glory , led you into this danger , do you save yourselves when an opportunity is given .
<start> Vos data facultate vobis consulite Simul in medios hostes irrupit duobusque interfectis reliquos a porta paulum summovit . <end>$$At the same time he rushed into the midst of the enemy , and slaying two of them , drove back the rest a little from the gate .
<start> Conantibus auxiliari suis Frustra , inquit , meae vitae subvenire conamini , quem iam sanguis viresque deficiunt Proinde abite , dum est facultas , vosque ad legionem recipite . <end>$$When his men attempted to aid him , In vain , he says , you endeavor to procure me safety , since blood and strength are now failing me , therefore leave this , while you have the opportunity , and retreat to the legion .
<start> Ita puguans post paulum concidit ac suis saluti fuit . <end>$$Thus he fell fighting a few moments after , and saved his men by his own death .
<start> Nostri , cum undique premerentur , XLVI centurionibus amissis deiecti sunt loco Sed intolerantius Gallos insequentes legio decima tardavit , quae pro subsidio paulo aequiore loco constiterat . <end>$$Our soldiers , being hard pressed on every side , were dislodged from their position , with the loss of forty-six centurions ; but the tenth legion , which had been posted in reserve on ground a little more level , checked the Gauls in their eager pursuit .
<start> Hanc rursus XIII legionis cohortes exceperunt , quae ex castris minoribus eductae cum Tito Sextio legato ceperant locum superiorem . <end>$$It was supported by the cohorts of the thirteenth legion , which , being led from the smaller camp , had , under the command of Titus Sextius , occupied the higher ground .
<start> Legiones , ubi primum planitiem attigerunt , infestis contra hostes signis constiterunt . <end>$$The legions , as soon as they reached the plain , halted and faced the enemy .
<start> Vercingetorix ab radicibus collis suos intra munitiones reduxit . <end>$$Vercingetorix led back his men from the part of the hill within the fortifications .
<start> Eo die milites sunt paulo minus septingenti desiderati . <end>$$On that day little less than seven hundred of the soldiers were missing .
<start> Postero die Caesar contione advocata temeritatem cupiditatemque militum reprehendit , quod sibi ipsi iudicavissent quo procedendum aut quid agendum videretur , neque signo recipiendi dato constitissent neque ab tribunis militum legatisque retineri potuissent Exposuit quid iniquitas loci posset , quid ipse ad Avaricum sensisset , cum sine duce et sine equitatu deprehensis hostibus exploratam victoriam dimisisset , ne parvum modo detrimentum in contentione propter iniquitatem loci accideret . <end>$$On the next day , Caesar , having called a meeting , censured the rashness and avarice of his soldiers , In that they had judged for themselves how far they ought to proceed , or what they ought to do , and could not be kept back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the lieutenants ; and stated , what the disadvantage of the ground could effect , what opinion he himself had entertained at Avaricum , when having surprised the enemy without either general or cavalry , he had given up a certain victory , lest even a trifling loss should occur in the contest owing to the disadvantage of position .
<start> Quanto opere eorum animi magnitudinem admiraretur , quos non castrorum munitiones , non altitudo montis , non murus oppidi tardare potuisset , tanto opere licentiam arrogantiamque reprehendere , quod plus se quam imperatorem de victoria atque exitu rerum sentire existimarent ; nec minus se ab milite modestiam et continentiam quam virtutem atque animi magnitudinem desiderare . <end>$$That as much as he admired the greatness of their courage , since neither the fortifications of the camp , nor the height of the mountain , nor the wall of the town could retard them ; in the same degree he censured their licentiousness and arrogance , because they thought that they knew more than their general concerning victory , and the issue of actions : and that he required in his soldiers forbearance and self-command , not less than valor and magnanimity .
<start> Hac habita contione et ad extremam orationem confirmatis militibus , ne ob hanc causam animo permoverentur neu quod iniquitas loci attulisset id virtuti hostium tribuerent , eadem de profectione cogitans quae ante senserat legiones ex castris eduxit aciemque idoneo loco constituit . <end>$$Having held this assembly , and having encouraged the soldiers at the conclusion of his speech , That they should not be dispirited on this account , nor attribute to the valor of the enemy , what the disadvantage of position had caused ; entertaining the same views of his departure that he had previously had , he led forth the legions from the camp , and drew up his army in order of battle in a suitable place .
<start> Cum Vercingetorix nihil magis in aequum locum descenderet , levi facto equestri proelio atque secundo in castra exercitum reduxit . <end>$$When Vercingetorix , nevertheless , would not descend to the level ground , a slight cavalry action , and that a successful one , having taken place , he led back his army into the camp .
<start> Cum hoc idem postero die fecisset , satis ad Gallicam ostentationem minuendam militumque animos confirmandos factum existimans in Aeduos movit castra . <end>$$When he had done this , the next day , thinking that he had done enough to lower the pride of the Gauls , and to encourage the minds of his soldiers , he moved his camp in the direction of the Aedui .
<start> Ne tum quidem insecutis hostibus tertio die ad flumen Elaver  ; pontem refecit exercitumque traduxit . <end>$$The enemy not even then pursuing us , on the third day he repaired the bridge over the river Allier , and led over his whole army .
<start> Ibi a Viridomaro atque Eporedorige Aeduis appellatus discit cum omni equitatu Litaviccum ad sollicitandos Aeduos profectum : opus esse ipsos antecedere ad confirmandam civitatem . <end>$$Having then held an interview with Viridomarus and Eporedirix the Aeduans , he learns that Litavicus had set out with all the cavalry to raise the Aedui ; that it was necessary that they too should go before him to confirm the state in their allegiance .
<start> Etsi multis iam rebus perfidiam Aeduorum perspectam habebat atque horum discessu admaturari defectionem civitatis existimabat , tamen eos retinendos non constituit , ne aut inferre iniuriam videretur aut dare timoris aliquam suspicionem . <end>$$Although he now saw distinctly the treachery of the Aedui in many things , and was of opinion that the revolt of the entire state would be hastened by their departure ; yet he thought that they should not be detained , lest he should appear either to offer an insult , or betray some suspicion of fear .
<start> Discedentibus his breviter sua in Aeduos merita exposuit , quos et quam humiles accepisset , compulsos in oppida , multatos agris omnibus ereptis copiis , imposito stipendio , obsidibus summa cum contumelia extortis , et quam in fortunam quamque in amplitudinem deduxisset , ut non solum in pristinum statum redissent , sed omnium temporum dignitatem et gratiam antecessisse viderentur . <end>$$He briefly states to them when departing his services toward the Aedui : in what a state and how humbled he had found them , driven into their towns , deprived of their lands , stripped of all their forces , a tribute imposed on them , and hostages wrested from them with the utmost insult ; and to what condition and to what greatness he had raised them , that they had not only recovered their former position , but seemed to surpass the dignity and influence of all the previous eras of their history .
<start> His datis mandatis eos ab se dimisit . <end>$$After giving these admonitions he dismissed them .
<start> Noviodunum erat oppidum Aeduorum ad ripas Ligeris opportuno loco positum . <end>$$Noviodunum was a town of the Aedui , advantageously situated on the banks of the Loire .
<start> Huc Caesar omnes obsides Galliae , frumentum , pecuniam publicam , suorum atque exercitus impedimentorum magnam partem contulerat ; huc magnum numerum equorum huius belli causa in Italia atque Hispania coemptum miserat . <end>$$Caesar had conveyed hither all the hostages of Gaul , the corn , public money , a great part of his own baggage and that of his army ; he had sent hither a great number of horses , which he had purchased in Italy and Spain on account of this war .
<start> Eo cum Eporedorix Viridomarusque venissent et de statu civitatis cognovissent , Litaviccum Bibracti ab Aeduis receptum , quod est oppidum apud eos maximae auctoritatis , Convictolitavim magistratum magnamque partem senatus ad eum convenisse , legatos ad Vercingetorigem de pace et amicitia concilianda publice missos , non praetermittendum tantum commodum existimaverunt . <end>$$When Eporedirix and Viridomarus came to this place , and received information of the disposition of the state , that Litavicus had been admitted by the Aedui into Bibracte , which is a town of the greatest importance among them , that Convictolitanis the chief magistrate and a great part of the senate had gone to meet him , that embassadors had been publicly sent to Vercingetorix to negotiate a peace and alliance ; they thought that so great an opportunity ought not to be neglected .
<start> Itaque interfectis Novioduni custodibus quique eo negotiandi causa convenerant pecuniam atque equos inter se partiti sunt ; obsides civitatum Bibracte ad magistratum deducendos curaverunt ; oppidum , quod a se teneri non posse iudicabant , ne cui esset usui Romanis , incenderunt ; frumenti quod subito potuerunt navibus avexerunt , reliquum flumine atque incendio corruperunt Ipsi ex finitimis regionibus copias cogere , praesidia custodiasque ad ripas Ligeris disponere equitatumque omnibus locis iniciendi timoris causa ostentare coeperunt , si ab re frumentaria Romanos excludere aut adductos inopia in provinciam espellere possent . <end>$$Therefore , having put to the sword the garrison of Noviodunum , and those who had assembled there for the purpose of trading or were on their march , they divided the money and horses among themselves ; they took care that the hostages of the states should be brought to Bibracte , to the chief magistrate ; they burned the town to prevent its being of any service to the Romans , as they were of opinion that they could not hold it ; they carried away in their vessels whatever corn they could in the hurry , they destroyed the remainder , by into the river or setting it on fire , they themselves began to collect forces from the neighboring country , to place guards and garrisons in different positions along the banks of the Loire , and to display the cavalry on all sides to strike terror into the Romans , if they could cut them off from a supply of provisions .
<start> Quam ad spem multum eos adiuvabat , quod Liger ex nivibus creverat , ut omnino vado non posse transiri videretur . <end>$$In which expectation they were much aided , from the circumstance that the Loire had swollen to such a degree from the melting of the snows , that it did not seem capable of being forded at all .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar maturandum sibi censuit , si esset in perficiendis pontibus periclitandum , ut prius quam essent maiores eo coactae copiae dimicaret . <end>$$Caesar on being informed of these movements was of opinion that he ought to make haste , even if he should run some risk in completing the bridges , in order that he might engage before greater forces of the enemy should be collected in that place .
<start> Nam ut commutato consilio iter in provinciam converteret , id ne metu quidem necessario faciendum existimabat ; cum infamia atque indignitas rei et oppositus mons Cevenna viarumque difficultas impediebat , tum maxime quod abiuncto Labieno atque eis legionibus quas una miserat vehementer timebat . <end>$$For no one even then considered it an absolutely necessary act , that changing his design he should direct his march into the Province , both because the infamy and disgrace of the thing , and the intervening mount Cevennes , and the difficulty of the roads prevented him ; and especially because he had serious apprehensions for the safety of Labienus whom he had detached , and those legions whom he had sent with him .
<start> Itaque admodum magnis diurnis nocturnisque itineribus confectis contra omnium opinionem ad Ligerem venit vadoque per equites invento pro rei necessitate opportuno , ut brachia modo atque humeri ad sustinenda arma liberi ab aqua esse possent , disposito equitatu qui vim fluminis refringeret , atque hostibus primo aspectu perturbatis , incolumem exercitum traduxit frumentumque in agris et pecoris copiam nactus repleto his rebus exercitu iter in Senones facere instituit . <end>$$Therefore , having made very long marches by day and night , he came to the river Loire , contrary to the expectation of all ; and having by means of the cavalry , found out a ford , suitable enough considering the emergency , of such depth that their arms and shoulders could be above water for supporting their accoutrements , he dispersed his cavalry in such a manner as to break the force of the current , and having confounded the enemy at the first sight , led his army across the river in safety ; and finding corn and cattle in the fields , after refreshing his army with them , he determined to march into the country of the Senones .
<start> Dum haec apud Caesarem geruntur , Labienus eo supplemento , quod nuper ex Italia venerat , relicto Agedinci , ut esset impedimentis praesidio , cum quattuor legionibus Lutetiam proficiscitur . <end>$$While these things are being done by Caesar , Labienus , leaving at Agendicum the recruits who had lately arrived from Italy , to guard the baggage , marches with four legions to Lutetia , whose arrival being discovered by the enemy , numerous forces arrived from the neighboring states .
<start> Summa imperi traditur Camulogeno Aulerco , qui prope confectus aetate tamen propter singularem scientiam rei militaris ad eum est honorem evocatus . <end>$$The supreme command is intrusted to Camalugenus one of the Aulerci , who , although almost worn out with age , was called to that honor on account of his extraordinary knowledge of military tactics .
<start> Labienus primo vineas agere , cratibus atque aggere paludem explere atque iter munire conabatur . <end>$$Labienus at first attempted to raise Vineae , fill up the marsh with hurdles and clay , and secure a road .
<start> Postquam id difficilius confieri animadvertit , silentio e castris tertia vigilia egressus eodem quo venerat itinere Metiosedum pervenit . <end>$$After he perceived that this was too difficult to accomplish , he issued in silence from his camp at the third watch , and reached Melodunum by the same route by which he came .
<start> Id est oppidum Senonum in insula Sequanae positum , ut paulo ante de Lutetia diximus . <end>$$This is a town of the Senones , situated on an island in the Seine , as we have just before observed of Lutetia .
<start> Deprensis navibus circiter quinquaginta celeriterque coniunctis atque eo militibus iniectis et rei novitate perterritis oppidanis , quorum magna pars erat ad bellum evocata , sine contentione oppido potitur . <end>$$Having seized upon about fifty ships and quickly joined them together , and having placed soldiers in them , he intimidated by his unexpected arrival the inhabitants , of whom a great number had been called out to the war , and obtains possession of the town without a contest .
<start> Refecto ponte , quem superioribus diebus hostes resciderant , exercitum traducit et secundo flumine ad Lutetiam iter facere coepit . <end>$$Having repaired the bridge , which the enemy had broken down during the preceding days , he led over his army , and began to march along the banks of the river to Lutetia .
<start> Hostes re cogmta ab eis , qui Metiosedo fugerant , Lutetiam incendi pontesque eius oppidi rescindi iubent ; ipsi profecti a palude ad ripas Sequanae e regione Lutetiae contra Labieni castra considunt . <end>$$The enemy , on learning the circumstance from those who had escaped from Melodunum , set fire to Lutetia , and order the bridges of that town to be broken down : they themselves set out from the marsh , and take their position on the banks of the Seine , over against Lutetia and opposite the camp of Labienus .
<start> Iam Caesar a Gergovia discessisse audiebatur , iam de Aeduorum defectione et secundo Galliae motu rumores adferebantur , Gallique in colloquiis interclusum itinere et Ligeri Caesarem inopia frumenti coactum in provinciam contendisse confirmabant . <end>$$Caesar was now reported to have departed from Gergovia ; intelligence was likewise brought to them concerning the revolt of the Aedui , and a successful rising in Gaul ; and that Caesar , having been prevented from prosecuting his journey and crossing the Loire , and having been compelled by the want of corn , had marched hastily to the province .
<start> Bellovaci autem defectione Aeduorum cognita , qui ante erant per se infideles , manus cogere atque aperte bellum parare coeperunt . <end>$$But the Bellovaci , who had been previously disaffected of themselves , on learning the revolt of the Aedui , began to assemble forces and openly to prepare for war .
<start> Tum Labienus tanta rerum commutatione longe aliud sibi capiendum consilium adque antea senserat intellegebat , neque iam , ut aliquid adquireret proelioque hostes lacesseret , sed ut incolumem exercitum Agedincum reduceret , cogitabat . <end>$$Then Labienus , as the change in affairs was so great , thought that he must adopt a very different system from what he had previously intended , and he did not now think of making any new acquisitions , or of provoking the enemy to an action ; but that he might bring back his army safe to Agendicum .
<start> Namque altera ex parte Bellovaci , quae civitas in Gallia maximam habet opinionem virtutis , instabant , alteram Camulogenus parato atque instructo exercitu tenebat ; tum legiones a praesidio atque impedimentis interclusas maximum flumen distinebat . <end>$$For , on one side , the Bellovaci , a state which held the highest reputation for prowess in Gaul , were pressing on him ; and Camulogenus , with a disciplined and well-equipped army , held the other side ; moreover , a very great river separated and cut off the legions from the garrison and baggage .
<start> Tantis subito difficultatibus obiectis ab animi virtute auxilium petendum videbat . <end>$$He saw that , in consequence of such great difficulties being thrown in his way , he must seek aid from his own energy of disposition .
<start> Sub vesperum consilio convocato cohortatus ut ea quae imperasset diligenter industrieque administrarent , naves , quas Metiosedo deduxerat , singulas equitibus Romanis attribuit , et prima confecta vigilia quattuor milia passuum secundo flumine silentio progredi ibique se exspectari iubet . <end>$$Having , therefore , called a council of war a little before evening , he exhorted his soldiers to execute with diligence and energy such commands as he should give ; he assigns the ships which he had brought from Melodunum to Roman knights , one to each , and orders them to fall down the river silently for four miles , at the end of the fourth watch , and there wait for him .
<start> Quinque cohortes , quas minime firmas ad dimicandum esse existimabat , castris praesidio relinquit ; quinque eiusdem legionis reliquas de media nocte cum omnibus impedimentis adverso flumine magno tumultu proficisci imperat . <end>$$He leaves the five cohorts , which he considered to be the most steady in action , to guard the camp ; he orders the five remaining cohorts of the same legion to proceed a little after midnight up the river with all their baggage , in a great tumult .
<start> Conquirit etiam lintres : has magno sonitu remorum incitatus in eandem partem mittit . <end>$$He collects also some small boats ; and sends them in the same direction , with orders to make a loud noise in rowing .
<start> Ipse post paulo silentio egressus cum tribus legionibus eum locum petit quo naves appelli iusserat . <end>$$He himself , a little after , marched out in silence , and , at the head of three legions , seeks that place to which he had ordered the ships to be brought .
<start> Eo cum esset ventum , exploratores hostium , ut omni fluminis parte erant dispositi , inopinantes , quod magna subito erat coorta tempestas , ab nostris opprimumtur ; exercitus equitatusque equitibus Romanis administrantibus , quos ei negotio praefecerat , celeriter transmittitur . <end>$$When he had arrived there , the enemy's scouts , as they were stationed along every part of the river , not expecting an attack , because a great storm had suddenly arisen , were surprised by our soldiers : the infantry and cavalry are quickly transported , under the superintendence of the Roman knights , whom he had appointed to that office .
<start> Vno fere tempore sub lucem hostibus nuntiatur in castris Romanorum praeter consuetudinem tumultuari et magnum ire agmen adverso flumine sonitumque remorum in eadem parte exaudiri et paulo infra milites navibus transportari . <end>$$Almost at the same time , a little before daylight , intelligence was given to the enemy that there was an unusual tumult in the camp of the Romans , and that a strong force was marching up the river , and that the sound of oars was distinctly heard in the same quarter , and that soldiers were being conveyed across in ships a little below .
<start> Quibus rebus auditis , quod existimabant tribus locis transire legiones atque omnes perturbatos defectione Aeduorum fugam parare , suas quoque copias in tres partes distribuerunt . <end>$$On hearing these things , because they were of opinion that the legions were passing in three different places , and that the entire army , being terrified by the revolt of the Aedui , were preparing for flight , they divided their forces also into three divisions .
<start> Nam praesidio e regione castrorum relicto et parva manu Metiosedum versus missa , quae tantum progrediatur , quantum naves processissent , reliquas copias contra Labienum duxerunt . <end>$$For leaving a guard opposite to the camp and sending a small body in the direction of Metiosedum , with orders to advance as far as the ships would proceed , they led the rest of their troops against Labienus .
<start> Prima luce et nostri omnes erant transportati , et hostium acies cernebatur . <end>$$By day-break all our soldiers were brought across , and the army of the enemy was in sight .
<start> Labienus milites cohortatus ut suae pristinae virtutis et secundissimorum proeliorum retinerent memoriam atque ipsum Caesarem , cuius ductu saepe numero hostes superassent , praesentem adesse existimarent , dat signum proeli . <end>$$Labienus , having encouraged his soldiers to retain the memory of their ancient valor , and so many most successful actions , and imagine Caesar himself , under whose command they had so often routed the enemy , to be present , gives the signal for action .
<start> Primo concursu ab dextro cornu , ubi septima legio constiterat , hostes pelluntur atque in fugam coniciuntur ; ab sinistro , quem locum duodecima legio tenebat , cum primi ordines hostium transfixi telis concidissent , tamen acerrime reliqui resistebant , nec dabat suspicionem fugae quisquam . <end>$$At the first onset the enemy are beaten and put to flight in the right wing , where the seventh legion stood : on the left wing , which position the twelfth legion held , although the first ranks fell transfixed by the javelins of the Romans , yet the rest resisted most bravely ; nor did any one of them show the slightest intention of flying .
<start> Ipse dux hostium Camulogenus suis aderat atque eos cohortabatur . <end>$$Camulogenus , the general of the enemy , was present and encouraged his troops .
<start> Incerto nunc etiam exitu victoriae , cum septimae legionis tribunis esset nuntiatum quae in sinistro cornu gererentur , post tergum hostium legionem ostenderunt signaque intulerunt . <end>$$But when the issue of the victory was still uncertain , and the circumstances which were taking place on the left wing were announced to the tribunes of the seventh legion , they faced about their legion to the enemy's rear and attacked it : not even then did any one retreat , but all were surrounded and slain .
<start> At ei qui praesidio contra castra Labieni erant relicti , cum proelium commissum audissent , subsidio suis ierunt collemque ceperunt , neque nostrorum militum victorum impetum sustinere potuerunt . <end>$$But those who were left as a guard opposite the camp of Labienus , when they heard that the battle was commenced , marched to aid their countrymen and take possession of a hill , but were unable to withstand the attack of the victorious soldiers .
<start> Sic cum suis fugientibus permixti , quos non silvae montesque texerunt , ab equitatu sunt interfecti . <end>$$In this manner , mixed with their own fugitives , such as the woods and mountains did not shelter were cut to pieces by our cavalry .
<start> Hoc negotio confecto Labienus revertitur Agedincum , ubi impedimenta totius exercitus relicta erant : inde cum omnibus copiis ad Caesarem pervenit . <end>$$When this battle was finished , Labienus returns to Agendicum , where the baggage of the whole army had been left : from it he marched with all his forces to Caesar .
<start> Defectione Aeduorum cognita bellum augetur . <end>$$The revolt of the Aedui being known , the war grows more dangerous .
<start> Legationes in omnes partes circummittuntur : quantum gratia , auctoritate , pecunia valent , ad sollicitandas civitates nituntur ; nacti obsides , quos Caesar apud eos deposuerat , horum supplicio dubitantes territant . <end>$$Embassies are sent by them in all directions : as far as they can prevail by influence , authority , or money , they strive to excite the state  .
<start> Petunt a Vercingetorige Aedui ut ad se veniat rationesque belli gerendi communicet . <end>$$Having got possession of the hostages whom Caesar had deposited with them , they terrify the hesitating by putting them to death .
<start> Re impetrata contendunt ut ipsis summa imperi tradatur , et re in controversiam deducta totius Galliae concilium Bibracte indicitur . <end>$$The Aedui request Vercingetorix to come to them and communicate his plans of conducting the war .
<start> Multitudinis suffragiis res permittitur : ad unum omnes Vercingetorigem probant imperatorem . <end>$$The decision is left to the votes of the mass ; all to a man approve of Vercingetorix as their general .
<start> Ab hoc concilio Remi , Lingones , Treveri afuerunt : illi , quod amicitiam Romanorum sequebantur ; Treveri , quod aberant longius et ab Germanis premebantur , quae fuit causa quare toto abessent bello et neutris auxilia mitterent . <end>$$The Remi , Lingones , and Treviri were absent from this meeting ; the two former because they attached themselves to the alliance of Rome ; the Treviri because they were very remote and were hard pressed by the Germans ; which was also the reason of their being absent during the whole war , and their sending auxiliaries to neither party .
<start> Magno dolore Aedui ferunt se deiectos principatu , queruntur fortunae commutationem et Caesaris indulgentiam in se requirunt , neque tamen suscepto bello suum consilium ab reliquis separare audent . <end>$$The Aedui are highly indignant at being deprived of the chief command ; they lament the change of fortune , and miss Caesar's indulgence toward them ; however , after engaging in the war , they do not dare to pursue their own measures apart from the rest .
<start> Inviti summae spei adulescentes Eporedorix et Viridomarus Vercingetorigi parent . <end>$$Eporedirix and Viridomarus , youths of the greatest promise , submit reluctantly to Vercingetorix .
<start> Ipse imperat reliquis civitatibus obsides diemque ei rei constituit Omnes equites , quindecim milia numero , celeriter convenire iubet ; peditatu quem antea habuerit se fore contentum dicit , neque fortunam temptaturum aut in acie dimicaturum , sed , quoniam abundet equitatu , perfacile esse factu frumentationibus pabulationibusque Romanos prohibere , aequo modo animo sua ipsi frumenta corrumpant aedificiaque incendant , qua rei familiaris iactura perpetuum imperium libertatemque se consequi videant . <end>$$The latter demands hostages from the remaining states ; nay , more , appointed a day for this proceeding ; he orders all the cavalry , fifteen thousand in number , to quickly assemble here ; he says that he will be content with the infantry which he had before , and would not tempt fortune nor come to a regular engagement ; but since he had abundance of cavalry , it would be very easy for him to prevent the Romans from obtaining forage or corn , provided that they themselves should resolutely destroy their corn and set fire to their houses ; by which sacrifice of private property they would evidently obtain perpetual dominion and freedom .
<start> His constitutis rebus Aeduis Segusiavisque , qui sunt finitimi provinciae , decem milia peditum imperat ; huc addit equites octingentos . <end>$$After arranging these matters , he levies ten thousand infantry on the Aedui and Segusiani , who border on our province : to these he adds eight hundred horse .
<start> His praeficit fratrem Eporedorigis bellumque inferri Allobrogibus iubet . <end>$$He sets over them the brother of Eporedirix , and orders him to wage war against the Allobroges .
<start> Altera ex parte Gabalos proximosque pagos Arvernorum in Helvios , item Rutenos Cadurcosque ad fines Volcarum Arecomicorum depopulandos mittit . <end>$$On the other side he sends the Gabali and the nearest cantons of the Arverni against the Helvii ; he likewise sends the Ruteni and Cadurci to lay waste the territories of the Volcae Arecomici .
<start> Nihilo minus clandestinis nuntiis legationibusque Allobrogas sollicitat , quorum mentes nondum ab superiore bello resedisse sperabat . <end>$$Besides , by secret messages and embassies , he tampers with the Allobroges , whose minds , he hopes , had not yet settled down after the excitement of the late war .
<start> Horum principibus pecunias , civitati autem imperium totius provinciae pollicetur . <end>$$To their nobles he promises money , and to their state the dominion of the whole province .
<start> Ad hos omnes casus provisa erant praesidia cohortium duarum et viginti , quae ex ipsa provincia ab Lucio Caesare legato ad omnes partes opponebantur . <end>$$The only guards provided against all these contingencies were twenty-two cohorts , which were collected from the entire province by Lucius Caesar , the lieutenant , and opposed to the enemy in every quarter .
<start> Helvii sua sponte cum finitimis proelio congressi pelluntur et Gaio Valerio Donnotauro , Caburi filio , principe civitatis , compluribusque aliis interfectis intra oppida ac muros compelluntur . <end>$$The Helvii , voluntarily engaging in battle with their neighbors , are defeated , and Caius Valerius Donotaurus , the son of Caburus , the principal man of the state , and several others , being slain , they are forced to retire within their towns and fortifications .
<start> Allobroges crebris ad Rhodanum dispositis praesidiis magna cum cura et diligentia suos fines tuentur . <end>$$The Allobroges , placing guards along the course of the Rhone , defend their frontiers with great vigilance and energy .
<start> Caesar , quod hostes equitatu superiores esse intellegebat et interclusis omnibus itineribus nulla re ex provincia atque Italia sublevari poterat , trans Rhenum in Germaniam mittit ad eas civitates quas superioribus annis pacaverat , equitesque ab his arcessit et levis armaturae pedites , qui inter eos proeliari consuerant . <end>$$Caesar , as he perceived that the enemy were superior in cavalry , and he himself could receive no aid from the Province or Italy , while all communication was cut off , sends across the Rhine into Germany to those states which he had subdued in the preceding campaigns , and summons from them cavalry and the light-armed infantry , who were accustomed to engage among them .
<start> Eorum adventu , quod minus idoneis equis utebantur , a tribunis militum reliquisque equitibus Romanis atque evocatis equos sumit Germanisque distribuit . <end>$$On their arrival , as they were mounted on unserviceable horses , he takes horses from the military tribunes and the rest , nay , even from the Roman knights and veterans , and distributes them among the Germans .
<start> Interea , dum haec geruntur , hostium copiae ex Arvernis equitesque qui toti Galliae erant imperati conveniunt . <end>$$In the mean time , whilst these things are going on , the forces of the enemy from the Arverni , and the cavalry which had been demanded from all Gaul , meet together .
<start> Si pedites suis auxilium ferant atque in eo morentur , iter facere non posse ; si , id quod magis futurum confidat , relictis impedimentis suae saluti consulant , et usu rerum necessariarum et dignitate spoliatum iri . <end>$$For as to the enemy's horse , they ought not to entertain a doubt that none of them would dare to advance beyond the main body .
<start> Nam de equitibus hostium , quin nemo eorum progredi modo extra agmen audeat , et ipsos quidem non debere dubitare , et quo maiore faciant animo , copias se omnes pro castris habiturum et terrori hostibus futurum . <end>$$In order that they may do so with greater spirit , he would marshal all their forces before the camp , and intimidate the enemy .
<start> Conclamant equites sanctissimo iureiurando confirmari oportere , ne tecto recipiatur , ne ad liberos , ne ad parentes , ad uxorem aditum habeat , qui non bis per agmen hostium perequitasset . <end>$$The cavalry unanimously shout out , That they ought to bind themselves by a most sacred oath , that he should not be received under a roof , nor have access to his children , parents , or wife , who shall not twice have ridden through the enemy's army .
<start> Probata re atque omnibus iureiurando adactis postero die in tres partes distributo equitatu duae se acies ab duobus lateribus ostendunt , una primo agmine iter impedire coepit . <end>$$This proposal receiving general approbation , and all being forced to take the oath , on the next day the cavalry were divided into three parts , and two of these divisions made a demonstration on our two flanks ; while one in front began to obstruct our march .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Caesar suum quoque equitatum tripertito divisum contra hostem ire iubet . <end>$$On this circumstance being announced , Caesar orders his cavalry also to form three divisions and charge the enemy .
<start> Pugnatur una omnibus in partibus Consistit agmen ; impedimenta intra legiones recipiuntur . <end>$$Then the action commences simultaneously in every part : the main body halts ; the baggage is received within the ranks of the legions .
<start> Si qua in parte nostri laborare aut gravius premi videbantur , eo signa inferri Caesar aciemque constitui iubebat ; quae res et hostes ad insequendum tardabat et nostros spe auxili confirmabat . <end>$$If our men seemed to be distressed , or hard pressed in any quarter , Caesar usually ordered the troops to advance , and the army to wheel round in that quarter ; which conduct retarded the enemy in the pursuit , and encouraged our men by the hope of support .
<start> Tandem Germani ab dextro latere summum iugum nacti hostes loco depellunt ; fugientes usque ad flumen , ubi Vercingetorix cum pedestribus copiis consederat , persecuntur compluresque interficiunt . <end>$$At length the Germans , on the right wing , having gained the top of the hill , dislodge the enemy from their position and pursue them even as far as the river at which Vercingetorix with the infantry was stationed , and slay several of them .
<start> Qua re animadversa reliqui ne circumirentur veriti se fugae mandant . <end>$$The rest , on observing this action , fearing lest they should be surrounded , betake themselves to flight .
<start> Omnibus locis fit caedes Tres nobilissimi Aedui capti ad Caesarem perducuntur : Cotus , praefectus equitum , qui controversiam cum Convictolitavi proximis comitiis habuerat , et Cavarillus , qui post defectionem Litavicci pedestribus copiis praefuerat , et Eporedorix , quo duce ante adventum Caesaris Aedui cum Sequanis bello contenderant . <end>$$A slaughter ensues in every direction , and three of the noblest of the Aedui are taken and brought to Caesar : Cotus , the commander of the cavalry , who had been engaged in the contest with Convictolitanis the last election , Cavarillus , who had held the command of the infantry after the revolt of Litavicus , and Eporedirix , under whose command the Aedui had engaged in war against the Sequani , before the arrival of Caesar .
<start> Fugato omni equitatu Vercingetorix copias , ut pro castris collocaverat , reduxit protinusque Alesiam , quod est oppidum Mandubiorum , iter facere coepit celeriterque impedimenta ex castris educi et se subsequi iussit . <end>$$All his cavalry being routed , Vercingetorix led back his troops in the same order as he had arranged them before the camp , and immediately began to march to Alesia , which is a town of the Mandubii , and ordered the baggage to be speedily brought forth from the camp , and follow him closely .
<start> Caesar impedimentis in proximum collem deductis , duabus legionibus praesidio relictis , secutus quantum diei tempus est passum , circiter tribus milibus hostium ex novissimo agmine interfectis altero die ad Alesiam castra fecit . <end>$$Caesar , having conveyed his baggage to the nearest hill , and having left two legions to guard it , pursued as far as the time of day would permit , and after slaying about three thousand of the rear of the enemy , encamped at Alesia on the next day .
<start> Perspecto urbis situ perterritisque hostibus , quod equitatu , qua maxime parte exercitus confidebant , erant pulsi , adhortatus ad laborem milites circumvallare instituit . <end>$$On reconnoitering the situation of the city , finding that the enemy were panic-stricken , because the cavalry in which they placed their chief reliance , were beaten , he encouraged his men to endure the toil , and began to draw a line of circumvallation round Alesia .
<start> Ipsum erat oppidum Alesia in colle summo admodum edito loco , ut nisi obsidione expugnari non posse videretur ; cuius collis radices duo duabus ex partibus flumina subluebant . <end>$$The town itself was situated on the top of a hill , in a very lofty position , so that it did not appear likely to be taken , except by a regular siege .
<start> Ante id oppidum planities circiter milia passuum tria in longitudinem patebat : reliquis ex omnibus partibus colles mediocri interiecto spatio pari altitudinis fastigio oppidum cingebant . <end>$$Two rivers , on two different sides , washed the foot of the hill Before the town lay a plain of about three miles in length ; on every other side hills at a moderate distance , and of an equal degree of height , surrounded the town .
<start> Sub muro , quae pars collis ad orientem solem spectabat , hunc omnem locum copiae Gallorum compleverant fossamque et maceriam sex in altitudinem pedum praeduxerant . <end>$$The army of the Gauls had filled all the space under the wall , comprising a part of the hill which looked to the rising sun , and had drawn in front a trench and a stone wall six feet high .
<start> Eius munitionis quae ab Romanis instituebatur circuitus XI milia passuum tenebat . <end>$$The circuit of that fortification , which was commenced by the Romans , comprised eleven miles .
<start> Castra opportunis locis erant posita ibique castella viginti tria facta , quibus in castellis interdiu stationes ponebantur , ne qua subito eruptio fieret : haec eadem noctu excubitoribus ac firmis praesidiis tenebantur . <end>$$The camp was pitched in a strong position , and twenty-three redoubts were raised in it , in which sentinels were placed by day , lest any sally should be made suddenly ; and by night the same were occupied by watches and strong guards .
<start> Opere instituto fit equestre proelium in ea planitie , quam intermissam collibus tria milia passuum in longitudinem patere supra demonstravimus . <end>$$The work having been begun , a cavalry action ensues in that plain , which we have already described as broken by hills , and extending three miles in length .
<start> Praesidio legionum addito nostris animus augetur : hostes in fugam coniecti se ipsi multitudine impediunt atque angustioribus portis relictis coacervantur . <end>$$The contest is maintained on both sides with the utmost vigor ; Caesar sends the Germans to aid our troops when distressed , and draws up the legions in front of the camp , lest any sally should be suddenly made by the enemy's infantry .
<start> Paulum legiones Caesar quas pro vallo constituerat promoveri iubet . <end>$$A great slaughter ensues ; some leave their horses , and endeavor to cross the ditch and climb the wall .
<start> Non minus qui intra munitiones erant perturbantur Galli : veniri ad se confestim existimantes ad arma conclamant ; nonnulli perterriti in oppidum irrumpunt . <end>$$Caesar orders the legions which he had drawn up in front of the rampart to advance a little .
<start> Vercingetorix , priusquam munitiones ab Romanis perficiantur , consilium capit omnem ab se equitatum noctu dimittere . <end>$$Vercingetorix adopts the design of sending away all his cavalry by night , before the fortifications should be completed by the Romans .
<start> Discedentibus mandat ut suam quisque eorum civitatem adeat omnesque qui per aetatem arma ferre possint ad bellum cogant Sua in illos merita proponit obtestaturque ut suae salutis rationem habeant neu se optime de communi libertate meritum in cruciatum hostibus dedant Quod si indiligentiores fuerint , milia hominum delecta octoginta una secum interitura demonstrat . <end>$$He charges them when departing that each of them should go to his respective state , and press for the war all who were old enough to bear arms ; he states his own merits , and conjures them to consider his safety , and not surrender him who had deserved so well of the general freedom , to the enemy for torture ; he points out to them that , if they should be remiss , eighty thousand chosen men would perish with him ; that upon making a calculation , he had barely corn for thirty days , but could hold out a little longer by economy .
<start> Ratione inita se exigue dierum triginta habere frumentum , sed paulo etiam longius tolerari posse parcendo His datis mandatis , qua opus erat intermissum , secunda vigilia silentio equitatum mittit Frumentum omne ad se referri iubet ; capitis poenam eis qui non paruerint constituit : pecus , cuius magna erat copia ab Mandubiis compulsa , viritim distribuit ; frumentum parce et paulatim metiri instituit ; copias omnes quas pro oppido collocaverat in oppidum recepit . <end>$$After giving these instructions he silently dismisses the cavalry in the second watch , where our works were not completed ; he orders all the corn to be brought to himself ; he ordains capital punishment to such as should not obey ; he distributes among them , man by man , the cattle , great quantities of which had been driven there by the Mandubii ; he began to measure out the corn sparingly , and by little and little ; he receives into the town all the forces which he had posted in front of it .
<start> His rationibus auxilia Galliae exspectare et bellum parat administrare . <end>$$In this manner he prepares to await the succors from Gaul , and carry on the war .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis ex perfugis et captivis , Caesar haec genera munitionis instituit Fossam pedum viginti directis lateribus duxit , ut eius fossae solum tantundem pateret quantum summae fossae labra distarent . <end>$$Caesar , on learning these proceedings from the deserters and captives , adopted the following system of fortification ; he dug a trench twenty feet deep , with perpendicular sides , in such a manner that the base of this trench should extend so far as the edges were apart at the top .
<start> Reliquas omnes munitiones ab ea fossa pedes quadringentos reduxit , hoc consilio , quoniam tantum esset necessario spatium complexus , nec facile totum corpus corona militum cingeretur , ne de improviso aut noctu ad munitiones hostium multitudo advolaret aut interdiu tela in nostros operi destinatos conicere possent . <end>$$He raised all his other works at a distance of four hundred feet from that ditch ; that with this intention , lest a large number of the enemy should suddenly , or by night , sally against the fortifications ; or lest they should by day cast weapons against our men while occupied with the works .
<start> Hoc intermisso spatio duas fossas quindecim pedes latas , eadem altitudine perduxit , quarum interiorem campestribus ac demissis locis aqua ex flumine derivata complevit . <end>$$Having left this interval , he drew two trenches fifteen feet broad , and of the same depth ; the innermost of them , being in low and level ground , he filled with water conveyed from the river .
<start> Post eas aggerem ac vallum duodecim pedum exstruxit Huic loricam pinnasque adiecit grandibus cervis eminentibus ad commissuras pluteorum atque aggeris , qui ascensum hostium tardarent , et turres toto opere circumdedit , quae pedes LXXX inter se distarent . <end>$$Behind these he raised a rampart and wall twelve feet high ; to this he added a parapet and battlements , with large stakes cut like stags' horns , projecting from the junction of the parapet and battlements , to prevent the enemy from scaling it , and surrounded the entire work with turrets , which were eighty feet distant from one another .
<start> Erat eodem tempore et materiari et frumentari et tantas munitiones fieri necesse deminutis nostris copiis quae longius ab castris progrediebantur : ac nonnum quam opera nostra Galli temptare atque eruptionem ex oppido pluribus portis summa vi facere conabantur . <end>$$It was necessary , at one and the same time , to procure timber , lay in supplies of corn , and raise also extensive fortifications , and the available troops were in consequence of this reduced in number , since they used to advance to some distance from the camp , and sometimes the Gauls endeavored to attack our works , and to make a sally from the town by several gates and in great force .
<start> Quare ad haec rursus opera addendum Caesar putavit , quo minore numero militum munitiones defendi possent . <end>$$Caesar thought that further additions should be made to these works , in order that the fortifications might be defensible by a small number of soldiers .
<start> Itaque truncis arborum aut admodum firmis ramis abscisis atque horum delibratis ac praeacutis cacuminibus perpetuae fossae quinos pedes altae ducebantur . <end>$$Having , therefore , cut down the trunks of trees or very thick branches , and having stripped their tops of the bark , and sharpened them into a point , he drew a continued trench every where five feet deep .
<start> Quini erant ordines coniuncti inter se atque implicati ; quo qui intraverant , se ipsi acutissimis vallis induebant . <end>$$There were five rows in connection with , and intersecting each other ; and whoever entered within them were likely to impale themselves on very sharp stakes .
<start> Hos cippos appellabant . <end>$$The soldiers called these cippi .
<start> Ante quos obliquis ordinibus in quincuncem dispositis scrobes tres in altitudinem pedes fodiebantur paulatim angustiore ad infimum fastigio . <end>$$Before these , which were arranged in oblique rows in the form of a quincunx , pits three feet deep were dug , which gradually diminished in depth to the bottom .
<start> Huc teretes stipites feminis crassitudine ab summo praeacuti et praeusti demittebantur , ita ut non amplius digitis quattuor ex terra eminerent ; simul confirmandi et stabiliendi causa singuli ab infimo solo pedes terra exculcabantur , reliqua pars scrobis ad occultandas insidias viminibus ac virgultis integebatur . <end>$$In these pits tapering stakes , of the thickness of a man's thigh ; sharpened at the top and hardened in the fire , were sunk in such a manner as to project from the ground not more than four inches ; at the same time for the purpose of giving them strength and stability , they were each filled with trampled clay to the height of one foot from the bottom : the rest of the pit was covered over with osiers and twigs , to conceal the deceit .
<start> Huius generis octoni ordines ducti ternos inter se pedes distabant . <end>$$Eight rows of this kind were dug , and were three feet distant from each other .
<start> Id ex similitudine floris lilium appellabant . <end>$$They called this a lily from its resemblance to that flower .
<start> Ante haec taleae pedem longae ferreis hamis infixis totae in terram infodiebantur mediocribusque intermissis spatiis omnibus locis disserebantur ; quos stimulos nominabant . <end>$$Stakes a foot long , with iron hooks attached to them , were entirely sunk in the ground before these , and were planted in every place at small intervals ; these they called spurs .
<start> His rebus perfectis regiones secutus quam potuit aequissimas pro loci natura quattuordecim milia passuum complexus pares eiusdem generis munitiones , diversas ab bis , contra exteriorem hostem perfecit , ut ne magna quidem multitudine , si ita accidat , munitionum praesidia circumfundi possent ; ac ne cum periculo ex castris egredi cogatur , dierum triginta pabulum frumentumque habere omnes convectum iubet . <end>$$After completing these works , saving selected as level ground as he could , considering the nature of the country , and having inclosed an area of fourteen miles , he constructed , against an external enemy , fortifications of the same kind in every respect , and separate from these , so that the guards of the fortifications could not be surrounded even by immense numbers , if such a circumstance should take place owing to the departure of the enemy's cavalry ; and in order that the Roman soldiers might not be compelled to go out of the camp with great risk , he orders all to provide forage and corn for thirty days .
<start> Dum haec apud Alesiam geruntur , Galli concilio principum indicto non omnes eos qui arma ferre possent , ut censuit Vercingetorix , convocandos statuunt , sed certum numerum cuique ex civitate imperandum , ne tanta multitudine confusa nec moderari nec discernere suos nec frumentandi rationem habere possent . <end>$$While those things are carried on at Alesia , the Gauls , having convened a council of their chief nobility , determine that all who could bear arms should not be called out , which was the opinion of Vercingetorix , but that a fixed number should be levied from each state ; lest , when so great a multitude assembled together , they could neither govern nor distinguish their men , nor have the means of supplying them with corn .
<start> Imperant Aeduis atque eorum clientibus , Segusiavis , Ambivaretis , Aulercis Brannovicibus , Blannoviis , milia XXXV ; parem numerum Arvernis adiunctis Eleutetis , Cadurcis , Gabalis , Vellaviis , qui sub imperio Arvernorum esse consuerunt ; Sequanis , Senonibus , Biturigibus , Santonis , Rutenis , Carnutibus duodena milia ; Bellovacis X ; totidem Lemovicibus ; octona Pictonibus et Turonis et Parisiis et Helvetiis ; Ambianis , Mediomatricis , Petrocoriis , Nerviis , Morinis , Nitiobrigibus quina milia ; Aulercis Cenomanis totidem ; Atrebatibus ; Veliocassis , Lexoviis et Aulercis Eburovicibus terna ; Rauracis et Boiis bina ; universis civitatibus , quae Oceanum attingunt quaeque eorum consuetudine Armoricae appellantur , quo sunt in numero Curiosolites , Redones , Ambibarii , Caletes , Osismi , Veneti , Lemovices , Venelli . <end>$$They demand thirty-five thousand men from the Aedui and their dependents , the Segusiani , Ambivareti , and Aulerci Brannovices ; an equal number from the Arverni in conjunction with the Eleuteti Cadurci , Gabali , and Velauni , who were accustomed to be under the command of the Arverni ; twelve thousand each from the Senones , Sequani , Bituriges , Sentones , Ruteni , and Carnutes ; ten thousand from the Bellovaci ; the same number from the Lemovici ; eight thousand each from the Pictones , and Turoni , and Parisii , and Helvii ; five thousand each from the Suessiones , Ambiani , Mediomatrici , Petrocorii , Nervii , Morini , and Nitiobriges ; the same number from the Aulerci Cenomani ; four thousand from the Atrebates ; three thousand each from the Bellocassi , Lexovii , and Aulerci Eburovices ; thirty thousand from the Rauraci , and Boii ; six thousand from all the states together , which border on the Atlantic , and which in their dialect are called Armoricae  .
<start> Ex his Bellovaci suum numerum non compleverunt , quod se suo nomine atque arbitrio cum Romanis bellum gesturos dicebant neque cuiusquam imperio obtemperaturos ; rogati tamen ab Commio pro eius hospitio duo milia una miserunt . <end>$$Of these the Bellovaci did not contribute their number , as they said that they would wage war against the Romans on their own account , and at their own discretion , and would not obey the order of any one : however , at the request of Commius , they sent two thousand , in consideration of a tie of hospitality which subsisted between him and them .
<start> Huius opera Commi , ut antea demonstravimus , fideli atque utili superioribus annis erat usus in Britannia Caesar ; quibus ille pro meritis civitatem eius immunem esse iusserat , iura legesque reddiderat atque ipsi Morinos attribuerat . <end>$$Caesar had , as we have previously narrated , availed himself of the faithful and valuable services of this Commius , in Britain , in former years : in consideration of which merits he had exempted from taxes his state , and had conferred on Commius himself the country of the Morini .
<start> Tamen tanta universae Galliae consensio fuit libertatis vindicandae et pristinae belli laudis recuperandae , ut neque beneficiis neque amicitiae memoria moverentur , omnesque et animo et opibus in id bellum incumberent . <end>$$Yet such was the unanimity of the Gauls in asserting their freedom , and recovering their ancient renown in war , that they were influenced neither by favors , nor by the recollection of private friendship ; and all earnestly directed their energies and resources to that war , and collected eight thousand cavalry , and about two hundred and forty thousand infantry .
<start> Coactis equitum VIII milibus et peditum circiter CCL haec in Aeduorum finibus recensebantur , numerusque inibatur , praefecti constituebantur Commio Atrebati , Viridomaro et Eporedorigi Aeduis , Vercassivellauno Arverno , consobrino Vercingetorigis , summa imperi traditur . <end>$$These were reviewed in the country of the Aedui , and a calculation was made of their numbers : commanders were appointed : the supreme command is intrusted to Commius the Atrebatian , Viridomarus and Eporedirix the Aeduans , and Vergasillaunus the Arvernan , the cousin-german of Vercingetorix .
<start> His delecti ex civitatibus attribuuntur , quorum consilio bellum administraretur . <end>$$To them are assigned men selected from each state , by whose advice the war should be conducted .
<start> Omnes alacres et fiduciae pleni ad Alesiam proficiscuntur , neque erat omnium quisquam qui aspectum modo tantae multitudinis sustineri posse arbitraretur , praesertim ancipiti proelio , cum ex oppido eruptione pugnaretur , foris tantae copiae equitatus peditatusque cernerentur . <end>$$All march to Alesia , sanguine and full of confidence : nor was there a single individual who imagined that the Romans could withstand the sight of such an immense host : especially in an action carried on both in front and rear , when the besieged would sally from the town and attack the enemy , and on the outside so great forces of cavalry and infantry would be seen .
<start> At ei , qui Alesiae obsidebantur praeterita die , qua auxilia suorum exspectaverant , consumpto omni frumento , inscii quid in Aeduis gereretur , concilio coacto de exitu suarum fortunarum consultabant . <end>$$But those who were blockaded at Alesia , the day being past , on which they had expected auxiliaries from their countrymen , and all their corn being consumed ignorant of what was going on among the Aedui , convened an assembly and deliberated on the exigency of their situation .
<start> Ac variis dictis sententiis , quarum pars deditionem , pars , dum vires suppeterent , eruptionem censebat , non praetereunda oratio Critognati videtur propter eius singularem et nefariam crudelitatem . <end>$$After various opinions had been expressed among them , some of which proposed a surrender , others a sally , while their strength would support it , the speech of Critognatus ought not to be omitted for its singular and detestable cruelty .
<start> Hic summo in Arvernis ortus loco et magnae habitus auctoritatis , Nihil , inquit , de eorum sententia dicturus sum , qui turpissimam servitutem deditionis nomine appellant , neque hos habendos civium loco neque ad concilium adhibendos censeo . <end>$$He sprung from the noblest family among the Arverni , and possessing great influence , says , I shall pay no attention to the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender by the name of a capitulation ; nor do I think that they ought to be considered as citizens , or summoned to the council .
<start> Cum his mihi res sit , qui eruptionem probant ; quorum in consilio omnium vestrum consensu pristinae residere virtutis memoria videtur . <end>$$My business is with those who approve of a sally : in whose advice the memory of our ancient prowess seems to dwell in the opinion of you all .
<start> Animi est ista mollitia , non virtus , paulisper inopiam ferre non posse . <end>$$To be unable to bear privation for a short time is disgraceful cowardice , not true valor .
<start> Qui se ultro morti offerant facilius reperiuntur quam qui dolorem patienter ferant . <end>$$Those who voluntarily offer themselves to death are more easily found than those who would calmly endure distress .
<start> Atque ego hanc sententiam probarem , si nullam praeterquam vitae nostrae iacturam fieri viderem : sed in consilio capiendo omnem Galliam respiciamus , quam ad nostrum auxilium concitavimus . <end>$$And I would approve of this opinion , could I foresee no other loss , save that of life ; but let us , in adopting our design , look back on all Gaul , which we have stirred up to our aid .
<start> Quid hominum milibus LXXX uno loco interfectis propinquis consanguineisque nostris animi fore existimatis , si paene in ipsis cadaveribus proelio decertare cogentur ? Nolite hos vestro auxilio exspoliare , qui vestrae salutis causa suum periculum neglexerunt , nec stultitia ac temeritate vestra aut animi imbecillitate omnem Galliam prosternere et perpetuae servituti subicere . <end>$$What courage do you think would our relatives and friends have , if eighty thousand men were butchered in one spot , supposing that they should be forced to come to an action almost over our corpses ? Do not utterly deprive them of your aid , for they have spurned all thoughts of personal danger on account of your safety ; nor by your folly , rashness , and cowardice , crush all Gaul and doom it to an eternal slavery .
<start> An , quod ad diem non venerunt , de eorum fide constantiaque dubitatis ? Quid ergo ? Romanos in illis ulterioribus munitionibus animine causa cotidie exerceri putatis ? Si illorum nuntiis confirmari non potestis omni aditu praesaepto , his utimini testibus appropinquare eorum adventum ; cuius rei timore exterriti diem noctemque in opere versantur . <end>$$Do you doubt their fidelity and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day ? What then ? Do you suppose that the Romans are employed every day in the outer fortifications for mere amusement ? If you can not be assured by their dispatches , since every avenue is blocked up , take the Romans as evidence that their approach is drawing near ; since they , intimidated by alarm at this , labor night and day at their works .
<start> Quid ergo mei consili est ? Facere , quod nostri maiores nequaquam pari bello Cimbrorum Teutonumque fecerunt ; qui in oppida compulsi ac simili inopia subacti eorum corporibus qui aetate ad bellum inutiles videbantur vitam toleraverunt neque se hostibus tradiderunt . <end>$$What , therefore , is my design ? To do as our ancestors did in the war against the Cimbri and Teutones , which was by no means equally momentous who , when driven into their towns , and oppressed by similar privations , supported life by the corpses of those who appeared useless for war on account of their age , and did not surrender to the enemy : and even if we had not a precedent for such cruel conduct , still I should consider it most glorious that one should be established , and delivered to posterity .
<start> Cuius rei si exemplum non haberemus , tamen libertatis causa institui et posteris prodi pulcherrimum iudicarem Nam quid illi simile bello fuit ? Depopulata Gallia Cimbri magnaque illata calamitate finibus quidem nostris aliquando excesserunt atque alias terras petierunt ; iura , leges , agros , libertatem nobis reliquerunt . <end>$$For in what was that war like this ? The Cimbri , after laying Gaul waste , and inflicting great calamities , at length departed from our country , and sought other lands ; they left us our rights , laws , lands , and liberty .
<start> Romani vero quid petunt aliud aut quid volunt , nisi invidia adducti , quos fama nobiles potentesque bello cognoverunt , horum in agris civitatibusque considere atque his aeternam iniungere servitutem ? Neque enim ulla alia condicione bella gesserunt . <end>$$But what other motive or wish have the Romans , than , induced by envy , to settle in the lands and states of those whom they have learned by fame to be noble and powerful in war , and impose on them perpetual slavery ? For they never have carried on wars on any other terms .
<start> Quod si ea quae in longinquis nationibus geruntur ignoratis , respicite finitimam Galliam , quae in provinciam redacta iure et legibus commutatis securibus subiecta perpetua premitur servitute . <end>$$But if you know not these things which are going on in distant countries , look to the neighboring Gaul , which being reduced to the form of a province , stripped of its rights and laws , and subjected to Roman despotism , is oppressed by perpetual slavery .
<start> Sententiis dictis constituunt ut ei qui valetudine aut aetate inutiles sunt bello oppido excedant , atque omnia prius experiantur , quam ad Critognati sententiam descendant : illo tamen potius utendum consilio , si res cogat atque auxilia morentur , quam aut deditionis aut pacis subeundam condicionem . <end>$$When different opinions were expressed , they determined that those who , owing to age or ill health , were unserviceable for war , should depart from the town , and that themselves should try every expedient before they had recourse to the advice of Critognatus : however , that they would rather adopt that design , if circumstances should compel them and their allies should delay , than accept any terms of a surrender or peace .
<start> Mandubii , qui eos oppido receperant , cum liberis atque uxoribus exire coguntur . <end>$$The Mandubii , who had admitted them into the town , are compelled to go forth with their wives and children .
<start> Hi , cum ad munitiones Romanorum accessissent , flentes omnibus precibus orabant , ut se in servitutem receptos cibo iuvarent . <end>$$When these came to the Roman fortifications , weeping , they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to receive them as slaves and relieve them with food .
<start> At Caesar dispositis in vallo custodibus recipi prohibebat . <end>$$But Caesar , placing guards on the rampart , forbade them to be admitted .
<start> Interea Commius reliquique duces quibus summa imperi permissa erat cum omnibus copiis ad Alesiam perveniunt et colle exteriore occupato non longius mille passibus ab nostris munitionibus considunt . <end>$$In the mean time , Commius and the rest of the leaders , to whom the supreme command had been intrusted , came with all their forces to Alesia , and having occupied the entire hill , encamped not more than a mile from our fortifications .
<start> Postero die equitatu ex castris educto omnem eam planitiem , quam in longitudinem tria milia passuum patere demonstravimus , complent pedestresque copias paulum ab eo loco abditas in locis superioribus constituunt . <end>$$The following day , having led forth their cavalry from the camp , they fill all that plain , which , we have related , extended three miles in length , and drew out their infantry a little from that place , and post them on the higher ground .
<start> Erat ex oppido Alesia despectus in campum . <end>$$The town Alesia commanded a view of the whole plain .
<start> Concurrunt his auxiliis visis ; fit gratulatio inter eos , atque omnium animi ad laetitiam excitantur . <end>$$The besieged run together when these auxiliaries were seen ; mutual congratulations ensue , and the minds of all are elated with joy .
<start> Itaque productis copiis ante oppidum considunt et proximam fossam cratibus integunt atque aggere explent seque ad eruptionem atque omnes casus comparant . <end>$$Accordingly , drawing out their troops , they encamp before the town , and cover the nearest trench with hurdles and fill it up with earth , and make ready for a sally and every casualty .
<start> Caesar omni exercitu ad utramque partem munitionum disposito , ut , si usus veniat , suum quisque locum teneat et noverit , equitatum ex castris educi et proelium committi iubet . <end>$$Caesar , having stationed his army on both sides of the fortifications , in order that , if occasion should arise , each should hold and know his own post , orders the cavalry to issue forth from the camp and commence action .
<start> Erat ex omnibus castris , quae summum undique iugum tenebant , despectus , atque omnes milites intenti pugnae proventum exspectabant . <end>$$There was a commanding view from the entire camp , which occupied a ridge of hills ; and the minds of all the soldiers anxiously awaited the issue of the battle .
<start> Galli inter equites raros sagittarios expeditosque levis armaturae interiecerant , qui suis cedentibus auxilio succurrerent et nostrorum equitum impetus sustinerent . <end>$$The Gauls had scattered archers and light-armed infantry here and there , among their cavalry , to give relief to their retreating troops , and sustain the impetuosity of our cavalry .
<start> Ab his complures de improviso vuluerati proelio excedebant . <end>$$Several of our soldiers were unexpectedly wounded by these , and left the battle .
<start> Cum suos pugna superiores esse Galli confiderent et nostros multitudine premi viderent , ex omnibus partibus et ei qui munitionibus continebantur et hi qui ad auxilium convenerant clamore et ululatu suorum animos confirmabant . <end>$$When the Gauls were confident that their countrymen were the conquerors in the action , and beheld our men hard pressed by numbers , both those who were hemmed in by the line of circumvallation and those who had come to aid them , supported the spirits of their men by shouts and yells from every quarter .
<start> Quod in conspectu omnium res gerebatur neque recte ac turpiter factum celari poterat , utrosque et laudis cupiditas et timor ignominiae ad virtutem excitabant . <end>$$As the action was carried on in sight of all , neither a brave nor cowardly act could be concealed ; both the desire of praise and the fear of ignominy , urged on each party to valor .
<start> Cum a meridie prope ad solis occasum dubia victoria pugnaretur , Germani una in parte confertis turmis in hostes impetum fecerunt eosque propulerunt ; quibus in fugam coniectis sagittarii circumventi interfectique sunt . <end>$$After fighting from noon almost to sunset , without victory inclining in favor of either , the Germans , on one side , made a charge against the enemy in a compact body , and drove them back ; and , when they were put to flight , the archers were surrounded and cut to pieces .
<start> Item ex reliquis partibus nostri cedentes usque ad castra insecuti sui colligendi facultatem non dederunt . <end>$$In other parts , likewise , our men pursued to the camp the retreating enemy , and did not give them an opportunity of rallying .
<start> At ei qui ab Alesia processerant maesti prope victoria desperata se in oppidum receperunt . <end>$$But those who had come forth from Alesia returned into the town dejected and almost despairing of success .
<start> Vno die intermisso Galli atque hoc spatio magno cratium , scalarum , harpagonum numero effecto media nocte silentio ex castris egressi ad campestres munitiones accedunt . <end>$$The Gauls , after the interval of a day and after making , during that time , an immense number of hurdles , scaling-ladders , and iron hooks , silently went forth from the camp at midnight and approached the fortifications in the plain .
<start> Subito clamore sublato , qua significatione qui in oppido obsidebantur de suo adventu cognoscere possent , crates proicere , fundis , sagittis , lapidibus nostros de vallo proturbare reliquaque quae ad oppugnationem pertinent parant administrare . <end>$$Raising a shout suddenly , that by this intimation those who were beseiged in the town might learn their arrival , they began to cast down hurdles and dislodge our men from the rampart by slings , arrows , and stones , and executed the other movements which are requisite in storming .
<start> Eodem tempore clamore exaudito dat tuba signum suis Vercingetorix atque ex oppido educit . <end>$$At the same time , Vercingetorix , having heard the shout , gives the signal to his troops by a trumpet , and leads them forth from the town .
<start> Nostri , ut superioribus diebus , ut cuique erat locus attributus , ad munitiones accedunt ; fundis librilibus sudibusque quas in opere disposuerant ac glandibus Gallos proterrent . <end>$$Our troops , as each man's post had been assigned him some days before , man the fortifications ; they intimidate the Gauls by slings , large stones , stakes which they had placed along the works , and bullets .
<start> Prospectu tenebris adempto multa utrimque vulnera accipiuntur Complura tormentis tela coniciuntur . <end>$$All view being prevented by the darkness , many wounds are received on both sides ; several missiles , are thrown from the engines .
<start> At Marcus Antonius et Gaius Trebonius legati , quibus hae partes ad defendendum obvenerant , qua ex parte nostros premi intellexerant , his auxilio ex ulterioribus castellis deductos summittebant . <end>$$But Marcus Antonius , and Caius Trebonius , the lieutenants , to whom the defense of these parts had been allotted , draughted troops from the redoubts which were more remote , and sent them to aid our troops , in whatever direction they understood that they were hard pressed .
<start> Dum longius ab munitione aberant Galli , plus multitudine telorum proficiebant ; posteaquam propius successerunt , aut se stimulis inopinantes induebant aut in scrobes delati transfodiebantur aut ex vallo ac turribus traiecti pilis muralibus interibant . <end>$$While the Gauls were at a distance from the fortification , they did more execution , owing to the immense number of their weapons : after they came nearer , they either unawares empaled themselves on the spurs , or were pierced by the mural darts from the ramparts and towers , and thus perished .
<start> Multis undique vulneribus acceptis nulla munitione perrupta , cum lux appeteret , veriti ne ab latere aperto ex superioribus castris eruptione circumvenirentur , se ad suos receperunt . <end>$$After receiving many wounds on all sides , and having forced no part of the works , when day drew nigh , fearing lest they should be surrounded by a sally made from the higher camp on the exposed flank , they retreated to their countrymen .
<start> At interiores , dum ea quae a Vercingetorige ad eruptionem praeparata erant proferunt , priores fossas explent , diutius in his rebus administrandis morati prius suos discessisse cognoverunt , quam munitionibus appropinquarent . <end>$$But those within , while they bring forward those things which had been prepared by Vercingetorix for a sally , fill up the nearest trenches ; having delayed a long time in executing these movements , they learned the retreat of their countrymen before they drew nigh to the fortifications .
<start> Ita re infecta in oppidum reverterunt . <end>$$Thus they returned to the town without accomplishing their object .
<start> Bis magno cum detrimento repulsi Galli quid agant consulunt ; locorum peritos adhibent : ex his superiorum castrorum situs munitionesque cognoscunt . <end>$$The Gauls , having been twice repulsed with great loss , consult what they should do ; they avail themselves of the information of those who were well acquainted with the country ; from them they ascertain the position and fortification of the upper camp .
<start> Erat a septentrionibus collis , quem propter magnitudinem circuitus opere circumplecti non potuerant nostri : necessario paene iniquo loco et leniter declivi castra fecerunt . <end>$$There was , on the north side , a hill , which our men could not include in their works , on account of the extent of the circuit , and had necessarily made their camp in ground almost disadvantageous , and pretty steep .
<start> Haec Gaius Antistius Reginus et Gaius Caninius Rebilus legati cum duabus legionibus obtinebant . <end>$$Caius Antistius Reginus , and Caius Caninius Rebilus , two of the lieutenants , with two legions , were in possession of this camp .
<start> Cognitis per exploratores regionibus duces hostium LX milia ex omni numero deligunt earum civitatum quae maximam virtutis opinionem habebant ; quid quoque pacto agi placeat occulte inter se constituunt ; adeundi tempus definiunt , cum meridies esse videatur . <end>$$The leaders of the enemy , having reconnoitered the country by their scouts , select from the entire army sixty thousand men , belonging to those states , which bear the highest character for courage ; they privately arrange among themselves what they wished to be done , and in what manner ; they decide that the attack should take place when it should seem to be noon .
<start> His copiis Vercassivellaunum Arvernum , unum ex quattuor ducibus , propinquum Vercingetorigis , praeficiunt . <end>$$They appoint over their forces Vergasillaunus , the Arvernian , one of the four generals , and a near relative of Vercingetorix .
<start> Ille ex castris prima vigilia egressus prope confecto sub lucem itinere post montem se occultavit militesque ex nocturno labore sese reficere iussit . <end>$$He , having issued from the camp at the first watch , and having almost completed his march a little before the dawn , hid himself behind the mountain , and ordered his soldiers to refresh themselves after their labor during the night .
<start> Cum iam meridies appropinquare videretur , ad ea castra quae supra demonstravimus contendit ; eodemque tempore equitatus ad campestres munitiones accedere et reliquae copiae pro castris sese ostendere coeperunt . <end>$$When noon now seemed to draw nigh , he marched hastily against that camp which we have mentioned before ; and , at the same time , the cavalry began to approach the fortifications in the plain , and the rest of the forces to make a demonstration in front of the camp .
<start> Vercingetorix ex arce Alesiae suos conspicatus ex oppido egreditur ; crates , longurios , musculos , falces reliquaque quae eruptionis causa paraverat profert . <end>$$Vercingetorix , having beheld his countrymen from the citadel of Alesia , issues forth from the town ; he brings forth from the camp long hooks , movable pent-houses , mural hooks , and other things , which he had prepared for the purpose of making a sally .
<start> Pugnatur uno tempore omnibus locis , atque omnia temptantur : quae minime visa pars firma est , huc concurritur . <end>$$They flocked to whatever part of the works seemed weakest .
<start> Romanorum manus tantis munitionibus distinetur nec facile pluribus locis occurrit . <end>$$The army of the Romans is distributed along their extensive lines , and with difficulty meets the enemy in every quarter .
<start> Caesar idoneum locum nactus quid quaque ex parte geratur cognoscit ; laborantibus summittit . <end>$$Caesar , having selected a commanding situation , sees distinctly whatever is going on in every quarter , and sends assistance to his troops when hard pressed .
<start> Maxime ad superiores munitiones laboratur , quo Vercassivellaunum missum demonstravimus . <end>$$The least elevation of ground , added to a declivity , exercises a momentous influence .
<start> Alii tela coniciunt , alii testudine facta subeunt ; defatigatis in vicem integri succedunt . <end>$$The earth , heaped up by all against the fortifications , gives the means of ascent to the Gauls , and covers those works which the Romans had concealed in the ground .
<start> His rebus cognitis Caesar Labienum cum cohortibus sex subsidio laborantibus mittit : imperat , si sustinere non posset , deductis cohortibus eruptione pugnaret ; id nisi necessario ne faciat . <end>$$Caesar , on observing these movements , sends Labienus with six cohorts to relieve his distressed soldiers : he orders him , if he should be unable to withstand them , to draw off the cohorts and make a sally ; but not to do this except through necessity .
<start> Ipse adit reliquos , cohortatur ne labori succumbant ; omnium superiorum dimicationum fructum in eo die atque hora docet consistere . <end>$$He himself goes to the rest , and exhorts them not to succumb to the toil ; he shows them that the fruits of all former engagements depend on that day and hour .
<start> Interiores desperatis campestribus locis propter magnitudinem munitionum loca praerupta ex ascensu temptant : huc ea quae paraverant conferunt Multitudine telorum ex turribus propugnantes deturbant , aggere et cratibus fossas explent , falcibus vallum ac loricam rescindunt . <end>$$The Gauls within , despairing of forcing the fortifications in the plains on account of the greatness of the works , attempt the places precipitous in ascent : hither they bring the engines which they had prepared ; by the immense number of their missiles they dislodge the defenders from the turrets : they fill the ditches with clay and hurdles , then clear the way ; they tear down the rampart and breast-work with hooks .
<start> Mittit primo Brutum adulescentem cum cohortibus Caesar , post cum aliis Gaium Fabium legatum ; postremo ipse , cum vehementius pugnaretur , integros subsidio adducit . <end>$$Caesar sends at first young Brutus , with six cohorts , and afterward Caius Fabius , his lieutenant , with seven others : finally , as they fought more obstinately , he leads up fresh men to the assistance of his soldiers .
<start> Restituto proelio ac repulsis hostibus eo quo Labienum miserat contendit ; cohortes quattuor ex proximo castello deducit , equitum partem sequi , partem circumire exteriores munitiones et ab tergo hostes adoriri iubet . <end>$$After renewing the action , and repulsing the enemy , he marches in the direction in which he had sent Labienus , drafts four cohorts from the nearest redoubt , and orders part of the cavalry to follow him , and part to make the circuit of the external fortifications and attack the enemy in the rear .
<start> Labienus , postquam neque aggeres neque fossae vim hostium sustinere poterant , coactis una XL cohortibus , quas ex proximis praesidus deductas fors obtulit , Caesarem per nuntios facit certiorem quid faciendum existimet . <end>$$Labienus , when neither the ramparts or ditches could check the onset of the enemy , informs Caesar by messengers of what he intended to do .
<start> Accelerat Caesar , ut proelio intersit . <end>$$Caesar hastens to share in the action .
<start> Eius adventu ex colore vestitus cognito , quo insigni in proeliis uti consuerat , turmisque equitum et cohortibus visis quas se sequi iusserat , ut de locis superioribus haec declivia et devexa cernebantur , hostes proelium committunt . <end>$$His arrival being known from the color of his robe , and the troops of cavalry , and the cohorts which he had ordered to follow him being seen , as these low and sloping grounds were plainly visible from the eminences , the enemy join battle .
<start> Vtrimque clamore sublato excipit rursus ex vallo atque omnibus munitionibus clamor . <end>$$A shout being raised by both sides , it was succeeded by a general shout along the ramparts and whole line of fortifications .
<start> Nostri omissis pilis gladiis rem gerunt Repente post tergum equitatus cernitur ; cohortes aliae appropinquant . <end>$$Our troops , laying aside their javelins , carry on the engagement with their swords .
<start> Hostes terga vertunt ; fugientibus equites occurrunt Fit magna caedes Sedulius , dux et princeps Lemovicum , occiditur ; Vercassivellaunus Arvernus vivus in fuga comprehenditur ; signa militaria septuaginta quattuor ad Caesarem referuntur : pauci ex tanto numero se incolumes in castra recipiunt . <end>$$The cavalry is suddenly seen in the rear of the Gauls ; the other cohorts advance rapidly ; the enemy turn their backs ; the cavalry intercept them in their flight , and a great slaughter ensues .
<start> De media nocte missus equitatus novissimum agmen consequitur : magnus numerus capitur atque interficitur ; reliqui ex fuga in civitates discedunt . <end>$$Immediately after midnight , the cavalry are sent out and overtake the rear , a great number are taken or cut to pieces , the rest by flight escape in different directions to their respective states .
<start> Postero die Vercingetorix concilio convocato id bellum se suscepisse non suarum necessitatium , sed communis libertatis causa demonstrat , et quoniam sit fortunae cedendum , ad utramque rem se illis offerre , seu morte sua Romanis satisfacere seu vivum tradere velint . <end>$$Vercingetorix , having convened a council the following day , declares , That he had undertaken that war , not on account of his own exigences , but on account of the general freedom ; and since he must yield to fortune , he offered himself to them for either purpose , whether they should wish to atone to the Romans by his death , or surrender him alive .
<start> Mittuntur de his rebus ad Caesarem legati . <end>$$Embassadors are sent to Caesar on this subject .
<start> Ipse in munitione pro castris consedit : eo duces producuntur ; Vercingetorix deditur , arma proiciuntur . <end>$$They surrender Vercingetorix , and lay down their arms .
<start> Reservatis Aeduis atque Arvernis , si per eos civitates reciperare posset , ex reliquis captivis toto exercitui capita singula praedae nomine distribuit . <end>$$Reserving the Aedui and Arverni , if he could gain over , through their influence , their respective states , he distributes one of the remaining captives to each soldier , throughout the entire army , as plunder .
<start> His rebus confectis in Aeduos proficiscitur ; civitatem recipit . <end>$$After making these arrangements , he marches into the Aedui , and recovers that state .
