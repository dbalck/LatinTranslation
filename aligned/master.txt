<start> Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres , quarum unam incolunt Belgae , aliam Aquitani , tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae , nostra Galli appellantur . <end>$$All Gaul is divided into three parts , one of which the Belgae inhabit , the Aquitani another , those who in their own language are called Celts , in ours Gauls , the third .
<start> Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen , a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit . <end>$$All these differ from each other in language , customs and laws .
<start> Eorum una pars , quam Gallos obtinere dictum est , initium capit a flumine Rhodano , continetur Garumna flumine , Oceano , finibus Belgarum , attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum , vergit ad septentriones . <end>$$One part of these , which it has been said that the Galli occupy , takes its beginning at the river Rhône ; it is bounded by the river Garonne , the ocean , and the territories of the Belgae ; it borders , too , on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii , upon the river Rhine , and stretches toward the north .
<start> Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur , pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni , spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem . <end>$$The Belgae rises from the extreme frontier of Gaul , extend to the lower part of the river Rhine ; and look toward the north and the rising sun .
<start> Apud Helvetios longe nobilissimus fuit et ditissimus Orgetorix . <end>$$Among the Helvetii , Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and wealthy .
<start> Is Marcus Messala , Marcus Pisone consulibus regni cupiditate inductus coniurationem nobilitatis fecit et civitati persuasit ut de finibus suis cum omnibus copiis exirent : perfacile esse , cum virtute omnibus praestarent , totius Galliae imperio potiri . <end>$$He , when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls , incited by lust of sovereignty , formed a conspiracy among the nobility , and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their possessions , that it would be very easy , since they excelled all in valour , to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Id hoc facilius iis persuasit , quod undique loci natura Helvetii continentur : una ex parte flumine Rheno latissimo atque altissimo , qui agrum Helvetium a Germanis dividit ; altera ex parte monte Iura altissimo , qui est inter Sequanos et Helvetios ; tertia lacu Lemanno et flumine Rhodano , qui provinciam nostram ab Helvetiis dividit . <end>$$To this he the more easily persuaded them , because the Helvetii are confined on every side by the nature of their situation ; on one side by the Rhine , a very broad and deep river , which separates the Helvetian territory from the Germans ; on a second side by the Jura , a very high mountain , which is between the Sequani and the Helvetii ; on a third by the Lake of Geneva , and by the river Rhône , which separates our Province from the Helvetii .
<start> His rebus fiebat ut et minus late vagarentur et minus facile finitimis bellum inferre possent ; qua ex parte homines bellandi cupidi magno dolore adficiebantur . <end>$$From these circumstances it resulted , that they could range less widely , and could less easily make war upon their neighbours ; for which reason men fond of war were affected with great regret .
<start> Pro multitudine autem hominum et pro gloria belli atque fortitudinis angustos se fines habere arbitrabantur , qui in longitudinem milia passuum CCXL , in latitudinem CLXXX patebant . <end>$$They thought , that considering the extent of their population , and their renown for warfare and bravery , they had but narrow limits , although they extended in length 240 , and in breadth 180 miles .
<start> His rebus adducti et auctoritate Orgetorigis permoti constituerunt ea quae ad proficiscendum pertinerent comparare , iumentorum et carrorum quam maximum numerum coemere , sementes quam maximas facere , ut in itinere copia frumenti suppeteret , cum proximis civitatibus pacem et amicitiam confirmare . <end>$$Induced by these considerations , and influenced by the authority of Orgetorix , they determined to provide such things as were necessary for their expedition—to buy up as great a number as possible of beasts of burden and wagons—to make their sowings as large as possible , so that on their march plenty of corn might be in store-and to establish peace and friendship with the neighboring states .
<start> Ad eas res conficiendas biennium sibi satis esse duxerunt ; in tertium annum profectionem lege confirmant . <end>$$They reckoned that a term of two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs ; they fix by decree their departure for the third year .
<start> Ad eas res conficiendas Orgetorix deligitur . <end>$$Orgetorix is chosen to complete these arrangements .
<start> Is sibi legationem ad civitates suscipit In eo itinere persuadet Castico , Catamantaloedis filio , Sequano , cuius pater regnum in Sequanis multos annos obtinuerat et a senatu populi Romani amicus appellatus erat , ut regnum in civitate sua occuparet , quod pater ante habuerit ; itemque Dumnorigi Haeduo , fratri Diviciaci , qui eo tempore principatum in civitate obtinebat ac maxime plebi acceptus erat , ut idem conaretur persuadet eique filiam suam in matrimonium dat . <end>$$He took upon himself the office of embassador to the states : on this journey he persuades Casticus , the son of Catamantaloedes , to seize upon the sovereignty in his own state , which his father had held before him , and he likewise persuades Dumnorix , an Aeduan , the brother of Diviciacus , who at that time possessed the chief authority in the state , and was exceedingly beloved by the people , to attempt the same , and gives him his daughter in marriage .
<start> Perfacile factu esse illis probat conata perficere , propterea quod ipse suae civitatis imperium obtenturus esset : non esse dubium quin totius Galliae plurimum Helvetii possent ; se suis copiis suoque exercitu illis regna conciliaturum confirmat . <end>$$He proves to them that to accomplish their attempts was a thing very easy to be done , because he himself would obtain the government of his own state ; that there was no doubt that the Helvetii were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul ; he assures them that he will , with his own forces and his own army , acquire the sovereignty for them .
<start> Hac oratione adducti inter se fidem et ius iurandum dant et regno occupato per tres potentissimos ac firmissimos populos totius Galliae sese potiri posse sperant . <end>$$Incited by this speech , they give a pledge and oath to one another , and hope that , when they have seized the sovereignty , they will , by means of the three most powerful and valiant nations , be enabled to obtain possession of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Ea res est Helvetiis per indicium enuntiata Moribus suis Orgetoricem ex vinculis causam dicere coegerunt ; damnatum poenam sequi oportebat , ut igni cremaretur . <end>$$When this scheme was disclosed to the Helvetii by informers , they , according to their custom , compelled Orgetorix to plead his cause in chains ; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire should await him if condemned .
<start> Die constituta causae dictionis Orgetorix ad iudicium omnem suam familiam , ad hominum milia decem , undique coegit , et omnes clientes obaeratosque suos , quorum magnum numerum habebat , eodem conduxit ; per eos ne causam diceret se eripuit . <end>$$On the day appointed for the pleading of his cause , Orgetorix drew together from all quarters to the court , all his vassals to the number of ten thousand persons ; and led together to the same place all his dependents and debtor-bondsmen , of whom he had a great number ; by means of those he rescued himself from pleading his cause .
<start> Cum civitas ob eam rem incitata armis ius suum exequi conaretur multitudinemque hominum ex agris magistratus cogerent , Orgetorix mortuus est ; neque abest suspicio , ut Helvetii arbitrantur , quin ipse sibi mortem consciverit . <end>$$While the state , incensed at this act , was endeavoring to assert its right by arms , and the magistrates were mustering a large body of men from the country , Orgetorix died ; and there is not wanting a suspicion , as the Helvetii think , of his having committed suicide .
<start> Post eius mortem nihilo minus Helvetii id quod constituerant facere conantur , ut e finibus suis exeant . <end>$$After his death , the Helvetii nevertheless attempt to do that which they had resolved on , namely , to go forth from their territories .
<start> Ubi iam se ad eam rem paratos esse arbitrati sunt , oppida sua omnia , numero ad duodecim , vicos ad quadringentos , reliqua privata aedificia incendunt ; frumentum omne , praeter quod secum portaturi erant , comburunt , ut domum reditionis spe sublata paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda essent ; trium mensum molita cibaria sibi quemque domo efferre iubent . <end>$$When they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking , they set fire to all their towns , in number about twelve-to their villages about four hundred-and to the private dwellings that remained ; they burn up all the corn , except what they intend to carry with them ; that after destroying the hope of a return home , they might be the more ready for undergoing all dangers .
<start> Persuadent Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis finitimis , uti eodem usi consilio oppidis suis vicisque exustis una cum iis proficiscantur , Boiosque , qui trans Rhenum incoluerant et in agrum Noricum transierant Noreiamque oppugnabant , receptos ad se socios sibi adsciscunt . <end>$$They order every one to carry forth from home for himself provisions for three months , ready ground They persuade the Rauraci , and the Tulingi , and the Latobrigi , their neighbors , to adopt the same plan , and after burning down their towns and villages , to set out with them : and they admit to their party and unite to themselves as confederates the Boii , who had dwelt on the other side of the Rhine , and had crossed over into the Norican territory , and assaulted Noreia .
<start> Erant omnino itinera duo , quibus itineribus domo exire possent : unum per Sequanos , angustum et difficile , inter montem Iuram et flumen Rhodanum , vix qua singuli carri ducerentur , mons autem altissimus impendebat , ut facile perpauci prohibere possent ; alterum per provinciam nostram , multo facilius atque expeditius , propterea quod inter fines Helvetiorum et Allobrogum , qui nuper pacati erant , Rhodanus fluit isque non nullis locis vado transitur . <end>$$There were in all two routes , by which they could go forth from their country one through the Sequani narrow and difficult , between Mount Jura and the river Rhone , the other , through our Province , much easier and freer from obstacles , because the Rhône flows between the boundaries of the Helvetii and those of the Allobroges , who had lately been subdued , and is in some places crossed by a ford .
<start> Extremum oppidum Allobrogum est proximumque Helvetiorum finibus Genava . <end>$$The furthest town of the Allobroges , and the nearest to the territories of the Helvetii , is Geneva .
<start> Ex eo oppido pons ad Helvetios pertinet . <end>$$From this town a bridge extends to the Helvetii .
<start> Allobrogibus sese vel persuasuros , quod nondum bono animo in populum Romanum viderentur , existimabant vel vi coacturos ut per suos fines eos ire paterentur . <end>$$They thought that they should either persuade the Allobroges , because they did not seem as yet well-affected toward the Roman people , or compel them by force to allow them to pass through their territories .
<start> Omnibus rebus ad profectionem comparatis diem dicunt , qua die ad ripam Rhodani omnes conveniant . <end>$$Having provided every thing for the expedition , they appoint a day , on which they should all meet on the bank of the Rhone .
<start> Is dies erat ante diem V Kalends Aprilis Lucius Pisone , Aulus Gabinio consulibus . <end>$$This day was the fifth before the kalends of April in the consulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius .
<start> Caesari cum id nuntiatum esset , eos per provinciam nostram iter facere conari , maturat ab urbe proficisci et quam maximis potest itineribus in Galliam ulteriorem contendit et ad Genavam pervenit . <end>$$When it was reported to Caesar that they were attempting to make their route through our Province he hastens to set out from the city , and , by as great marches as he can , proceeds to Further Gaul , and arrives at Geneva .
<start> Provinciae toti quam maximum potest militum numerum imperat (erat omnino in Gallia ulteriore legio una) , pontem , qui erat ad Genavam , iubet rescindi . <end>$$He orders the whole Province as great a number of soldiers as possible , as there was in all only one legion in Further Gaul : he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down .
<start> Ubi de eius adventu Helvetii certiores facti sunt , legatos ad eum mittunt nobilissimos civitatis , cuius legationis Nammeius et Verucloetius principem locum obtinebant , qui dicerent sibi esse in animo sine ullo maleficio iter per provinciam facere , propterea quod aliud iter haberent nullum : rogare ut eius voluntate id sibi facere liceat . <end>$$When the Helvetii are apprized of his arrival they send to him , as embassadors , the most illustrious men of their state , to say that it was their intention to march through the Province without doing any harm , because they had no other route : that they requested , they might be allowed to do so with his consent .
<start> Caesar , quod memoria tenebat Lucius Cassium consulem occisum exercitumque eius ab Helvetiis pulsum et sub iugum missum , concedendum non putabat ; neque homines inimico animo , data facultate per provinciam itineris faciundi , temperaturos ab iniuria et maleficio existimabat . <end>$$Caesar , inasmuch as he kept in remembrance that Lucius Cassius , the consul , had been slain , and his army routed and made to pass under the yoke by the Helvetii , did not think that ought to be granted : nor was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition , if an opportunity of marching through the Province were given them , would abstain from outrage and mischief .
<start> Tamen , ut spatium intercedere posset dum milites quos imperaverat convenirent , legatis respondit diem se ad deliberandum sumpturum : si quid vellent , ad Idus Apriles reverterentur . <end>$$Yet , in order that a period might intervene , until the soldiers whom he had ordered should assemble , he replied to the ambassadors , that he would take time to deliberate ; if they wanted any thing , they might return on the day before the ides of April .
<start> Interea ea legione quam secum habebat militibusque , qui ex provincia convenerant , a lacu Lemanno , qui in flumen Rhodanum influit , ad montem Iuram , qui fines Sequanorum ab Helvetiis dividit , milia passuum XVIIII murum in altitudinem pedum sedecim fossamque perducit . <end>$$Meanwhile , with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers which had assembled from the Province , he carries along for nineteen miles a wall , to the height of sixteen feet , and a trench , from the Lake of Geneva , which flows into the river Rhone , to Mount Jura , which separates the territories of the Sequani from those of the Helvetii .
<start> Eo opere perfecto praesidia disponit , castella communit , quo facilius , si se invito transire conentur , prohibere possit . <end>$$When that work was finished , he distributes garrisons , and closely fortifies redoubts , in order that he may the more easily intercept them , if they should attempt to cross over against his will .
<start> Ubi ea dies quam constituerat cum legatis venit et legati ad eum reverterunt , negat se more et exemplo populi Romani posse iter ulli per provinciam dare et , si vim facere conentur , prohibiturum ostendit . <end>$$When the day which he had appointed with the embassadors came , and they returned to him ; he says , that he can not , consistently with the custom and precedent of the Roman people , grant any one a passage through the Province ; and he gives them to understand , that , if they should attempt to use violence he would oppose them .
<start> Helvetii ea spe deiecti navibus iunctis ratibusque compluribus factis , alii vadis Rhodani , qua minima altitudo fluminis erat , non numquam interdiu , saepius noctu si perrumpere possent conati , operis munitione et militum concursu et telis repulsi , hoc conatu destiterunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , disappointed in this hope , tried , if they could , to force a passage , but being kept at bay by the strength of our works , and by the concourse of the soldiers , and by the missiles , they desisted from this attempt .
<start> Relinquebatur una per Sequanos via , qua Sequanis invitis propter angustias ire non poterant . <end>$$There was left one way , through the Sequani , by which , on account of its narrowness , they could not pass without the consent of the Sequani .
<start> His cum sua sponte persuadere non possent , legatos ad Dumnorigem Haeduum mittunt , ut eo deprecatore a Sequanis impetrarent . <end>$$As they could not of themselves prevail on them , they send embassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan , that through his intercession , they might obtain their request from the Sequani .
<start> Dumnorix gratia et largitione apud Sequanos plurimum poterat et Helvetiis erat amicus , quod ex ea civitate Orgetorigis filiam in matrimonium duxerat , et cupiditate regni adductus novis rebus studebat et quam plurimas civitates suo beneficio habere obstrictas volebat . <end>$$Dumnorix , by his popularity and liberality , had great influence among the Sequani , and was friendly to the Helvetii , because out of that state he had married the daughter of Orgetorix ; and , incited by lust of sovereignty , was anxious for a revolution , and wished to have as many states as possible attached to him by his kindness toward them .
<start> Itaque rem suscipit et a Sequanis impetrat ut per fines suos Helvetios ire patiantur , obsidesque uti inter sese dent perficit : Sequani , ne itinere Helvetios prohibeant , Helvetii , ut sine maleficio et iniuria transeant . <end>$$He , therefore , undertakes the affair , and prevails upon the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to march through their territories , and arranges that they should give hostages to each other-the Sequani not to obstruct the Helvetii in their march-the Helvetii , to pass without mischief and outrage .
<start> Caesari renuntiatur Helvetiis esse in animo per agrum Sequanorum et Haeduorum iter in Santonum fines facere , qui non longe a Tolosatium finibus absunt , quae civitas est in provincia . <end>$$It is again told to Caesar , that the Helvetii intended to march through the country of the Sequani and the Aedui into the territories of the Santones , which are not far distant from those boundaries of the Tolosates , which is a state in the Province .
<start> Id si fieret , intellegebat magno cum periculo provinciae futurum ut homines bellicosos , populi Romani inimicos , locis patentibus maximeque frumentariis finitimos haberet . <end>$$If this took place , he saw that it would be attended with great danger to the Province to have warlike men , enemies of the Roman people , bordering upon an open and very fertile tract of country .
<start> Ob eas causas ei munitioni quam fecerat Titus Labienum legatum praeficit ; ipse in Italiam magnis itineribus contendit duasque ibi legiones conscribit et tres , quae circum Aquileiam hiemabant , ex hibernis educit et , qua proximum iter in ulteriorem Galliam per Alpes erat , cum his quinque legionibus ire contendit . <end>$$For these reasons he appointed Titus Labienus , his legate , to the command of the fortification which he had made He himself proceeds to Italy by forced marches , and there levies two legions , and leads out from winter-quarters three which were wintering around Aquileia , and with these five legions marches rapidly by the nearest route across the Alps into Further Gaul .
<start> Ibi Ceutrones et Graioceli et Caturiges locis superioribus occupatis itinere exercitum prohibere conantur . <end>$$Here the Centrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges , having taken possession of the higher parts , attempt to obstruct the army in their march .
<start> Compluribus his proeliis pulsis ab Ocelo , quod est oppidum citerioris provinciae extremum , in fines Vocontiorum ulterioris provinciae die septimo pervenit ; inde in Allobrogum fines , ab Allobrogibus in Segusiavos exercitum ducit . <end>$$After having routed these in several battles , he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on the seventh day from Ocelum , which is the most remote town of the Hither Province ; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges , and from the Allobroges to the Segusiani .
<start> Hi sunt extra provinciam trans Rhodanum primi . <end>$$These people are the first beyond the Province on the opposite side of the Rhône .
<start> Helvetii iam per angustias et fines Sequanorum suas copias traduxerant et in Haeduorum fines pervenerant eorumque agros populabantur . <end>$$The Helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the narrow defile and the territories of the Sequani , and had arrived at the territories of the Aedui , and were ravaging their lands .
<start> Haedui , cum se suaque ab iis defendere non possent , legatos ad Caesarem mittunt rogatum auxilium : ita se omni tempore de populo Romano meritos esse ut paene in conspectu exercitus nostri agri vastari , liberi in servitutem abduci , oppida expugnari non debuerint . <end>$$The Aedui , as they could not defend themselves and their possessions against them , send embassadors to Caesar to ask assistance , that they had at all times so well deserved of the Roman people , that their fields ought not to have been laid waste-their children carried off into slavery-their towns stormed , almost within sight of our army .
<start> Eodem tempore quo Haedui Ambarri , necessarii et consanguinei Haeduorum , Caesarem certiorem faciunt sese depopulatis agris non facile ab oppidis vim hostium prohibere Item Allobroges , qui trans Rhodanum vicos possessionesque habebant , fuga se ad Caesarem recipiunt et demonstrant sibi praeter agri solum nihil esse reliqui . <end>$$At the same time the Ambarri , the friends and kinsmen of the Aedui , apprize Caesar , that it was not easy for them , now that their fields had been devastated , to ward off the violence of the enemy from their towns : the Allobroges likewise , who had villages and possessions on the other side of the Rhône , betake themselves in flight to Caesar , and assure him that they had nothing remaining , except the soil of their land .
<start> Quibus rebus adductus Caesar non expectandum sibi statuit dum , omnibus , fortunis sociorum consumptis , in Santonos Helvetii pervenirent . <end>$$Caesar , induced by these circumstances , decides , that he ought not to wait until the Helvetii , after destroying all the property of his allies , should arrive among the Santones .
<start> Flumen est Arar , quod per fines Haeduorum et Sequanorum in Rhodanum influit , incredibili lenitate , ita ut oculis in utram partem fluat iudicari non possit . <end>$$There is a river the Saône , which flows through the territories of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhône with such incredible slowness , that it can not be determined by the eye in which direction it flows .
<start> Id Helvetii ratibus ac lintribus iunctis transibant . <end>$$This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined together .
<start> Ubi per exploratores Caesar certior factus est tres iam partes copiarum Helvetios id flumen traduxisse , quartam vero partem citra flumen Ararim reliquam esse , de tertia vigilia cum legionibus tribus e castris profectus ad eam partem pervenit quae nondum flumen transierat . <end>$$When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had already conveyed three parts of their forces across that river , but that the fourth part was left behind on this side of the Saône , he set out from the camp with three legions during the third watch , and came up with that division which had not yet crossed the river .
<start> Eos impeditos et inopinantes adgressus magnam partem eorum concidit ; reliqui sese fugae mandarunt atque in proximas silvas abdiderunt . <end>$$Attacking them encumbered with baggage , and not expecting him , he cut to pieces a great part of them ; the rest betook themselves to flight , and concealed themselves in the nearest woods .
<start> Is pagus appellabatur Tigurinus ; nam omnis civitas Helvetia in quattuor pagos divisa est . <end>$$That canton was called the Tigurine ; for the whole Helvetian state is divided into four cantons .
<start> Hic pagus unus , cum domo exisset , patrum nostrorum memoria Lucius Cassium consulem interfecerat et eius exercitum sub iugum miserat . <end>$$This single canton having left their country , within the recollection of our fathers , had slain Lucius Cassius the consul , and had made his army pass under the yoke .
<start> Ita sive casu sive consilio deorum immortalium quae pars civitatis Helvetiae insignem calamitatem populo Romano intulerat , ea princeps poenam persolvit . <end>$$Thus , whether by chance , or by the design of the immortal gods , that part of the Helvetian state which had brought a signal calamity upon the Roman people , was the first to pay the penalty .
<start> Qua in re Caesar non solum publicas , sed etiam privatas iniurias ultus est , quod eius soceri Lucius Pisonis avum , Lucius Pisonem legatum , Tigurini eodem proelio quo Cassium interfecerant . <end>$$In this Caesar avenged not only the public but also his own personal wrongs , because the Tigurini had slain Lucius Piso the legate , the grandfather of Lucius Calpurnius Piso , his father-in-law , in the same battle as Cassius himself .
<start> Hoc proelio facto reliquas copias Helvetiorum ut consequi posset , pontem in Arari faciendum curat atque ita exercitum traducit . <end>$$This battle ended , that he might be able to come up with the remaining forces of the Helvetii , he procures a bridge to be made across the Saône , and thus leads his army over .
<start> Is ita cum Caesare egit : si pacem populus Romanus cum Helvetiis faceret , in eam partem ituros atque ibi futuros Helvetios ubi eos Caesar constituisset atque esse voluisset ; sin bello persequi perseveraret , reminisceretur et veteris incommodi populi Romani et pristinae virtutis Helvetiorum . <end>$$The Helvetii , confused by his sudden arrival , when they found that he had effected in one day , what they , themselves had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in twenty namely , the crossing of the river , send embassadors to him ; at the head of which embassy was Divico , who had been commander of the Helvetii , in the war against Cassius .
<start> His Caesar ita respondit : eo sibi minus dubitationis dari , quod eas res quas legati Helvetii commemorassent memoria teneret , atque eo gravius ferre quo minus merito populi Romani accidissent ; qui si alicuius iniuriae sibi conscius fuisset , non fuisse difficile cavere ; sed eo deceptum , quod neque commissum a se intellegeret quare timeret neque sine causa timendum putaret . <end>$$To these words Caesar thus replied : —that on that very account he felt less hesitation , because he kept in remembrance those circumstances which the Helvetian embassadors had mentioned , and that he felt the more indignant at them , in proportion as they had happened undeservedly to the Roman people : for if they had been conscious of having done any wrong , it would not have been difficult to be on their guard , but for that very reason had they been deceived , because neither were they aware that any offense had been given by them , on account of which they should be afraid , nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without cause .
<start> Quod si veteris contumeliae oblivisci vellet , num etiam recentium iniuriarum , quod eo invito iter per provinciam per vim temptassent , quod Haeduos , quod Ambarros , quod Allobrogas vexassent , memoriam deponere posse ? Quod sua victoria tam insolenter gloriarentur quodque tam diu se impune iniurias tulisse admirarentur , eodem pertinere Consuesse enim deos immortales , quo gravius homines ex commutatione rerum doleant , quos pro scelere eorum ulcisci velint , his secundiores interdum res et diuturniorem impunitatem concedere . <end>$$But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage , could he also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs , in that they had against his will attempted a route through the Province by force , in that they had molested the Aedui , the Ambarri , and the Allobroges ? That as to their so insolently boasting of their victory , and as to their being astonished that they had so long committed their outrages with impunity , tended to the same point ; for the immortal gods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to punish for their guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity , in order that they may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances .
<start> Cum ea ita sint , tamen , si obsides ab iis sibi dentur , uti ea quae polliceantur facturos intellegat , et si Haeduis de iniuriis quas ipsis sociisque eorum intulerint , item si Allobrogibus satisfaciant , sese cum iis pacem esse facturum . <end>$$Although these things are so , yet , if hostages were to be given him by them in order that he may be assured these will do what they promise , and provided they will give satisfaction to the Aedui for the outrages which they had committed against them and their allies , and likewise to the Allobroges , he will make peace with them .
<start> Divico respondit : ita Helvetios a maioribus suis institutos esse uti obsides accipere , non dare , consuerint ; eius rei populum Romanum esse testem . <end>$$Divico replied , that the Helvetii had been so trained by their ancestors , that they were accustomed to receive , not to give hostages ; of that fact the Roman people were witness .
<start> Hoc responso dato discessit . <end>$$Having given this reply , he withdrew .
<start> Postero die castra ex eo loco movent Idem facit Caesar equitatumque omnem , ad numerum quattuor milium , quem ex omni provincia et Haeduis atque eorum sociis coactum habebat , praemittit , qui videant quas in partes hostes iter faciant . <end>$$On the following day they move their camp from that place ; Caesar does the same , and sends forward all his cavalry , to the number of four thousand , to observe toward what parts the enemy are directing their march .
<start> Qui cupidius novissimum agmen insecuti alieno loco cum equitatu Helvetiorum proelium committunt ; et pauci de nostris cadunt . <end>$$These , having too eagerly pursued the enemy's rear , come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in a disadvantageous place , and a few of our men fall .
<start> Quo proelio sublati Helvetii , quod quingentis equitibus tantam multitudinem equitum propulerant , audacius subsistere non numquam et novissimo agmine proelio nostros lacessere coeperunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , elated with this battle , because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so large a body of horse , began to face us more boldly , sometimes too from their rear to provoke our men by an attack .
<start> Caesar suos a proelio continebat , ac satis habebat in praesentia hostem rapinis , pabulationibus populationibusque prohibere . <end>$$Caesar restrained his men from battle , deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine , forage , and depredation .
<start> Ita dies circiter XV iter fecerunt uti inter novissimum hostium agmen et nostrum primum non amplius quinis aut senis milibus passuum interesset . <end>$$They marched for about fifteen days in such a manner that there was not more than five or six miles between the enemy's rear and our van .
<start> Interim cotidie Caesar Haeduos frumentum , quod essent publice polliciti , flagitare Nam propter frigora non modo frumenta in agris matura non erant , sed ne pabuli quidem satis magna copia suppetebat ; eo autem frumento quod flumine Arari navibus subvexerat propterea uti minus poterat quod iter ab Arari Helvetii averterant , a quibus discedere nolebat . <end>$$Meanwhile , Caesar kept daily importuning the Aedui for the corn which they had promised in the name of their state ; for , in consequence of the coldness , not only was the corn in the fields not ripe , but there was not in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder : besides he was unable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river Saône , because the Helvetii , from whom he was unwilling to retire had diverted their march from the Saône .
<start> Diem ex die ducere Haedui : conferri , comportari , adesse dicere . <end>$$The Aedui kept deferring from day to day , and saying that it was being collected—brought in—on the road .
<start> Ubi se diutius duci intellexit et diem instare quo die frumentum militibus metiri oporteret , convocatis eorum principibus , quorum magnam copiam in castris habebat , in his Diviciaco et Lisco , qui summo magistratui praeerat , quem vergobretum appellant Haedui , qui creatur annuus et vitae necisque in suos habet potestatem , graviter eos accusat , quod , cum neque emi neque ex agris sumi possit , tam necessario tempore , tam propinquis hostibus ab iis non sublevetur , praesertim cum magna ex parte eorum precibus adductus bellum susceperit  . <end>$$When he saw that he was put off too long , and that the day was close at hand on which he ought to serve out the corn to his soldiers ; —having called together their chiefs , of whom he had a great number in his camp , among them Diviciacus and Liscus who was invested with the chief magistracy , he severely reprimands them , because he is not assisted by them on so urgent an occasion , when the enemy were so close at hand , and when could neither be bought nor taken from the fields , particularly as , in a great measure urged by their prayers , he had undertaken the war ; much more bitterly , therefore does he complain of his being forsaken .
<start> Tum demum Liscus oratione Caesaris adductus quod antea tacuerat proponit : esse non nullos , quorum auctoritas apud plebem plurimum valeat , qui privatim plus possint quam ipsi magistratus Hos seditiosa atque improba oratione multitudinem deterrere , ne frumentum conferant quod debeant : praestare , si iam principatum Galliae obtinere non possint , Gallorum quam Romanorum imperia perferre , neque dubitare quin , si Helvetios superaverint Romani , una cum reliqua Gallia Haeduis libertatem sint erepturi . <end>$$Then at length Liscus , moved by Caesar's speech , discloses what he had hitherto kept secret : —that there are some whose influences with the people is very great , who , though private men , have more power than the magistrates themselves : that these by seditions and violent language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought to supply ; that , if they can not any longer retain the supremacy of Gaul , it were better to submit to the government of Gauls than of Romans , nor ought they to doubt that , if the Romans should overpower the Helvetii , they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui together with the remainder of Gaul .
<start> Ab isdem nostra consilia quaeque in castris gerantur hostibus enuntiari ; hos a se coerceri non posse Quin etiam , quod necessariam rem coactus Caesari enuntiarit , intellegere sese quanto id cum periculo fecerit , et ob eam causam quam diu potuerit tacuisse . <end>$$By these very men , , are our plans and whatever is done in the camp , disclosed to the enemy ; that they could not be restrained by him : nay more , he was well aware , that though compelled by necessity , he had disclosed the matter to Caesar , at how great a risk he had done it ; and for that reason , he had been silent as long as he could .
<start> Caesar hac oratione Lisci Dumnorigem , Diviciaci fratrem , designari sentiebat , sed , quod pluribus praesentibus eas res iactari nolebat , celeriter concilium dimittit , Liscum retinet . <end>$$Caesar perceived that by this speech of Liscus , Dumnorix , the brother of Diviciacus , was indicated ; but , as he was unwilling that these matters should be discussed while so many were present , he speedily dismisses the council , but detains Liscus : he inquires from him when alone , about those things which he had said in the meeting .
<start> His rebus et suam rem familiarem auxisse et facultates ad largiendum magnas comparasse ; magnum numerum equitatus suo sumptu semper alere et circum se habere , neque solum domi , sed etiam apud finitimas civitates largiter posse , atque huius potentiae causa matrem in Biturigibus homini illic nobilissimo ac potentissimo conlocasse ; ipsum ex Helvetiis uxorem habere , sororem ex matre et propinquas suas nuptum in alias civitates conlocasse Favere et cupere Helvetiis propter eam adfinitatem , odisse etiam suo nomine Caesarem et Romanos , quod eorum adventu potentia eius deminuta et Diviciacus frater in antiquum locum gratiae atque honoris sit restitutus . <end>$$He makes inquiries on the same points privately of others , and discovered that it is all true ; that Dumnorix is the person , a man of the highest daring , in great favor with the people on account of his liberality , a man eager for a revolution : that for a great many years he has been in the habit of contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the Aedui at a small cost , because when he bids , no one dares to bid against him .
<start> Itaque prius quam quicquam conaretur , Diviciacum ad se vocari iubet et , cotidianis interpretibus remotis , per Gaius Valerium Troucillum , principem Galliae provinciae , familiarem suum , cui summam omnium rerum fidem habebat , cum eo conloquitur ; simul commonefacit quae ipso praesente in concilio de Dumnorige sint dicta , et ostendit quae separatim quisque de eo apud se dixerit . <end>$$One thing stood in the way of all this-that he had learned by experience his brother Diviciacus's very high regard for the Roman people , his great affection toward him , his distinguished faithfulness , justice , and moderation ; for he was afraid lest by the punishment of this man , he should hurt the feelings of Diviciacus .
<start> Diviciacus multis cum lacrimis Caesarem complexus obsecrare coepit ne quid gravius in fratrem statueret : scire se illa esse vera , nec quemquam ex eo plus quam se doloris capere , propterea quod , cum ipse gratia plurimum domi atque in reliqua Gallia , ille minimum propter adulescentiam posset , per se crevisset ; quibus opibus ac nervis non solum ad minuendam gratiam , sed paene ad perniciem suam uteretur . <end>$$Diviciacus , embracing Caesar , begins to implore him , with many tears , that he would not pass any very severe sentence upon his brother ; saying , that he knows that those charges are true , and that nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did ; for when he himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and in the rest of Gaul , and he very little on account of his youth , the latter had become powerful through his means , which power and strength he used not only to the lessening of his popularity , but almost to his ruin ; that he , however , was influenced both by fraternal affection and by public opinion .
<start> Sese tamen et amore fraterno et existimatione vulgi commoveri Quod si quid ei a Caesare gravius accidisset , cum ipse eum locum amicitiae apud eum teneret , neminem existimaturum non sua voluntate factum ; qua ex re futurum uti totius Galliae animi a se averterentur . <end>$$But if any thing very severe from Caesar should befall him , no one would think that it had been done without his consent , since he himself held such a place in Caesar's friendship : from which circumstance it would arise , that the affections of the whole of Gaul would be estranged from him .
<start> Haec cum pluribus verbis flens a Caesare peteret , Caesar eius dextram prendit ; consolatus rogat finem orandi faciat ; tanti eius apud se gratiam esse ostendit uti et rei publicae iniuriam et suum dolorem eius voluntati ac precibus condonet . <end>$$As he was with tears begging these things of Caesar in many words , Caesar takes his right hand , and , comforting him , begs him to make an end of entreating , and assures him that his regard for him is so great , that he forgives both the injuries of the republic and his private wrongs , at his desire and prayers .
<start> Dumnorigem ad se vocat , fratrem adhibet ; quae in eo reprehendat ostendit ; quae ipse intellegat , quae civitas queratur proponit ; monet ut in reliquum tempus omnes suspiciones vitet ; praeterita se Diviciaco fratri condonare dicit . <end>$$He summons Dumnorix to him ; he brings in his brother ; he points out what he censures in him ; he lays before him what he of himself perceives , and what the state complains of ; he warns him for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion ; he says that he pardons the past , for the sake of his brother , Diviciacus .
<start> Dumnorigi custodes ponit , ut quae agat , quibuscum loquatur scire possit . <end>$$He sets spies over Dumnorix that he may be able to know what he does , and with whom he communicates .
<start> Eodem die ab exploratoribus certior factus hostes sub monte consedisse milia passuum ab ipsius castris octo , qualis esset natura montis et qualis in circuitu ascensus qui cognoscerent misit . <end>$$Being on the same day informed by his scouts , that the enemy had encamped at the foot of a mountain eight miles from his own camp ; he sent persons to ascertain what the nature of the mountain was , and of what kind the ascent on every side .
<start> Renuntiatum est facilem esse . <end>$$Word was brought back , that it was easy .
<start> De tertia vigilia Titus Labienum , legatum pro praetore , cum duabus legionibus et iis ducibus qui iter cognoverant summum iugum montis ascendere iubet ; quid sui consilii sit ostendit . <end>$$During the third watch he orders Titus Labienus , his legate with praetorian powers , to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain with two legions , and with those as guides who had examined the road ; he explains what his plan is .
<start> Ipse de quarta vigilia eodem itinere quo hostes ierant ad eos contendit equitatumque omnem ante se mittit . <end>$$He himself during the fourth watch , hastens to them by the same route by which the enemy had gone , and sends on all the cavalry before him .
<start> Publius Considius , qui rei militaris peritissimus habebatur et in exercitu Lucius Sullae et postea in Marcus Crassi fuerat , cum exploratoribus praemittitur . <end>$$Publius Considius , who was reputed to be very experienced in military affairs , and had been in the army of Lucius Sulla , and afterward in that of Marcus Crassus , is sent forward with the scouts .
<start> Prima luce , cum summus mons a Labieno teneretur , ipse ab hostium castris non longius mille et quingentis passibus abesset neque , ut postea ex captivis comperit , aut ipsius adventus aut Labieni cognitus esset , Considius equo admisso ad eum accurrit , dicit montem , quem a Labieno occupari voluerit , ab hostibus teneri : id se a Gallicis armis atque insignibus cognovisse . <end>$$At day-break , when the summit of the mountain was in the possession of Titus Labienus , and he himself was not further off than a mile and half from the enemy's camp , nor , as he afterward ascertained from the captives , had either his arrival or that of Labienus been discovered ; Considius , with his horse at full gallop , comes up to him says that the mountain which he wished should be seized by Labienus , is in possession of the enemy ; that he has discovered this by the Gallic arms and ensigns .
<start> Caesar suas copias in proximum collem subducit , aciem instruit . <end>$$Caesar leads off his forces to the next hill : draws them up in battle-order .
<start> Labienus , ut erat ei praeceptum a Caesare ne proelium committeret , nisi ipsius copiae prope hostium castra visae essent , ut undique uno tempore in hostes impetus fieret , monte occupato nostros expectabat proelioque abstinebat . <end>$$Labienus , as he had been ordered by Caesar not to come to an engagement unless own forces were seen near the enemy's camp , that the attack upon the enemy might be made on every side at the same time , was , after having taken possession of the mountain , waiting for our men , and refraining from battle .
<start> Multo denique die per exploratores Caesar cognovit et montem a suis teneri et Helvetios castra , movisse et Considium timore perterritum quod non vidisset pro viso sibi renuntiavisse . <end>$$When , at length , the day was far advanced , Caesar learned through spies , that the mountain was in possession of his own men , and that the Helvetii had moved their camp , and that Considius , struck with fear , had reported to him , as seen , that which he had not seen .
<start> Eo die quo consuerat intervallo hostes sequitur et milia passuum tria ab eorum castris castra ponit . <end>$$On that day he follows the enemy at his usual distance , and pitches his camp three miles from theirs .
<start> Ea res per fugitivos Lucius Aemilii , decurionis equitum Gallorum , hostibus nuntiatur . <end>$$This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some deserters from Lucius Aemilius , a captain of the Gallic horse .
<start> Helvetii , seu quod timore perterritos Romanos discedere a se existimarent , eo magis quod pridie superioribus locis occupatis proelium non commisissent , sive eo quod re frumentaria intercludi posse confiderent , commutato consilio atque itinere converso nostros a novissimo agmine insequi ac lacessere coeperunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , either because they thought that the Romans , struck with terror , were retreating from them , the more so , as the day before , though they had seized on the higher grounds , they had not joined battle or because they flattered themselves that they might be cut of from the provisions , altering their plan and changing their route , began to pursue , and to annoy our men in the rear .
<start> Postquam id animum advertit , copias suas Caesar in proximum collem subduxit equitatumque , qui sustineret hostium impetum , misit . <end>$$Caesar , when he observes this , draws off his forces to the next hill , and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy .
<start> Ipse interim in colle medio triplicem aciem instruxit legionum quattuor veteranarum ; in summo iugo duas legiones quas in Gallia citeriore proxime conscripserat et omnia auxilia conlocavit , ita ut supra se totum montem hominibus compleret ; impedimenta sarcinasque in unum locum conferri et eum ab iis qui in superiore acie constiterant muniri iussit . <end>$$He himself , meanwhile , drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of his four veteran legions in such a manner , that he placed above him on the very summit the two legions , which he had lately levied in Hither Gaul , and all the auxiliaries ; and he ordered that the whole mountain should be covered with men , and that meanwhile the baggage should be brought together into one place , and the position be protected by those who were posted in the upper line .
<start> Helvetii cum omnibus suis carris secuti impedimenta in unum locum contulerunt ; ipsi confertissima acie , reiecto nostro equitatu , phalange facta sub primam nostram aciem successerunt . <end>$$The Helvetii having followed with all their wagons , collected their baggage into one place : they themselves , after having repulsed our cavalry and formed a phalanx , advanced up to our front line in very close order .
<start> Caesar primum suo , deinde omnium ex conspectu remotis equis , ut aequato omnium periculo spem fugae tolleret , cohortatus suos proelium commisit . <end>$$Caesar , having removed out of sight first his own horse , then those of all , that he might make the danger of all equal , and do away with the hope of flight , after encouraging his men , joined battle .
<start> Milites loco superiore pilis missis facile hostium phalangem perfregerunt . <end>$$His soldiers hurling their javelins from the higher ground , easily broke the enemy's phalanx .
<start> Ea disiecta gladiis destrictis in eos impetum fecerunt . <end>$$That being dispersed , they made a charge on them with drawn swords .
<start> Gallis magno ad pugnam erat impedimento quod pluribus eorum scutis uno ictu pilorum transfixis et conligatis , cum ferrum se inflexisset , neque evellere neque sinistra impedita satis commode pugnare poterant , multi ut diu iactato bracchio praeoptarent scutum manu emittere et nudo corpore pugnare . <end>$$It was a great hinderance to the Gauls in fighting , that , when several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the javelins pierced through and pinned fast together , as the point of the iron had bent itself , they could neither pluck it out , nor , with their left hand entangled , fight with sufficient ease ; so that many , after having long tossed their arm about , chose rather to cast away the buckler from their hand , and to fight with their person unprotected .
<start> Tandem vulneribus defessi et pedem referre et , quod mons suberit circiter mille passuum <spatio> , eo se recipere coeperunt . <end>$$At length , worn out with wounds , they began to give way , and , as there was in the neighborhood a mountain about a mile off , to betake themselves thither .
<start> Capto monte et succedentibus nostris , Boi et Tulingi , qui hominum milibus circiter XV agmen hostium claudebant et novissimis praesidio erant , ex itinere nostros ab latere aperto adgressi circumvenere , et id conspicati Helvetii , qui in montem sese receperant , rursus instare et proelium redintegrare coeperunt . <end>$$When the mountain had been gained , and our men were advancing up , the Boii and Tulingi , who with about 15 , 000 men closed the enemy's line of march and served as a guard to their rear , having assailed our men on the exposed flank as they advanced to surround them ; upon seeing which , the Helvetii who had betaken themselves to the mountain , began to press on again and renew the battle .
<start> Romani signa bipertito intulerunt : prima et secunda acies , ut victis ac submotis resisteret , tertia , ut venientes sustineret . <end>$$The Romans having faced about , advanced to the attack in two divisions ; the first and second line , to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off the field ; the third to receive those who were just arriving .
<start> Ita ancipiti proelio diu atque acriter pugnatum est . <end>$$Thus , was the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful success .
<start> Diutius cum sustinere nostrorum impetus non possent , alteri se , ut coeperant , in montem receperunt , alteri ad impedimenta et carros suos se contulerunt . <end>$$When they could no longer withstand the attacks of our men , the one division , as they had begun to do , betook themselves to the mountain ; the other repaired to their baggage and wagons .
<start> Nam hoc toto proelio , cum ab hora septima ad vesperum pugnatum sit , aversum hostem videre nemo potuit . <end>$$For during the whole of this battle , although the fight lasted from the seventh hour to eventide , no one could see an enemy with his back turned .
<start> Ad multam noctem etiam ad impedimenta pugnatum est , propterea quod pro vallo carros obiecerunt et e loco superiore in nostros venientes tela coiciebant et non nulli inter carros rotasque mataras ac tragulas subiciebant nostrosque vulnerabant . <end>$$The fight was carried on also at the baggage till late in the night , for they had set wagons in the way as a rampart , and from the higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men , as they came on , and some from between the wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and javelins from beneath , and wounding our men .
<start> Diu cum esset pugnatum , impedimentis castrisque nostri potiti sunt . <end>$$After the fight had lasted some time , our men gained possession of their baggage and camp .
<start> Ibi Orgetorigis filia atque unus e filiis captus est . <end>$$There the daughter and one of the sons of Orgetorix was taken .
<start> Ex eo proelio circiter hominum milia CXXX superfuerunt eaque tota nocte continenter ierunt ; in fines Lingonum die quarto pervenerunt , cum et propter vulnera militum et propter sepulturam occisorum nostri eos sequi non potuissent . <end>$$After the battle about 130 , 000 men remained alive , who marched incessantly during the whole of that night ; and after a march discontinued for no part of the night , arrived in the territories of the Lingones on the fourth day , while our men , having stopped for three days , both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of the slain , had not been able to follow them .
<start> Caesar ad Lingonas litteras nuntiosque misit , ne eos frumento neve alia re iuvarent : qui si iuvissent , se eodem loco quo Helvetios habiturum . <end>$$Caesar sent letters and messengers to the Lingones that they should not assist them with corn or with any thing else ; for that if they should assist them , he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii .
<start> Ipse triduo intermisso cum omnibus copiis eos sequi coepit . <end>$$After the three days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his forces .
<start> Helvetii omnium rerum inopia adducti legatos de deditione ad eum miserunt . <end>$$The Helvetii , compelled by the want of every thing , sent embassadors to him about a surrender .
<start> Qui cum eum in itinere convenissent seque ad pedes proiecissent suppliciterque locuti flentes pacem petissent , atque eos in eo loco quo tum essent suum adventum expectare iussisset , paruerunt . <end>$$When these had met him on the way and had thrown themselves at his feet , and speaking in suppliant tone had with tears sued for peace , and he had ordered them to await his arrival , in the place , where they then were , they obeyed his commands .
<start> Eo postquam Caesar pervenit , obsides , arma , servos qui ad eos perfugissent , poposcit . <end>$$When Caesar arrived at that place , he demanded hostages , their arms , and the slaves who had deserted to them .
<start> Dum ea conquiruntur et conferuntur , circiter hominum milia VI eius pagi qui Verbigenus appellatur , sive timore perterriti , ne armis traditis supplicio adficerentur , sive spe salutis inducti , quod in tanta multitudine dediticiorum suam fugam aut occultari aut omnino ignorari posse existimarent , prima nocte e castris Helvetiorum egressi ad Rhenum finesque Germanorum contenderunt . <end>$$While those things are being sought for and got together , after a night's interval , about 6000 men of that canton which is called the Verbigene , whether terrified by fear , lest after delivering up their arms , they should suffer punishment , or else induced by the hope of safety , because they supposed that , amid so vast a multitude of those who had surrendered themselves , their flight might either be concealed or entirely overlooked , having at night-fall departed out of the camp of the Helvetii , hastened to the Rhine and the territories of the Germans .
<start> Quod ubi Caesar resciit , quorum per fines ierant his uti conquirerent et reducerent , si sibi purgati esse vellent , imperavit ; reductos in hostium numero habuit ; reliquos omnes obsidibus , armis , perfugis traditis in deditionem accepit . <end>$$But when Caesar discovered this , he commanded those through whose territory they had gone , to seek them out and to bring them back again , if they meant to be acquitted before him ; and considered them , when brought back , in the light of enemies ; he admitted all the rest to a surrender , upon their delivering up the hostages , arms , and deserters .
<start> Helvetios , Tulingos , Latobrigos in fines suos , unde erant profecti , reverti iussit , et , quod omnibus frugibus amissis domi nihil erat quo famem tolerarent , Allobrogibus imperavit ut iis frumenti copiam facerent ; ipsos oppida vicosque , quos incenderant , restituere iussit . <end>$$He ordered the Helvetii , the Tulingi , and the Latobrigi , to return to their territories from which they had come , and as there was at home nothing whereby they might support their hunger , all the productions of the earth having been destroyed , he commanded the Allobroges to let them have a plentiful supply of corn ; and ordered them to rebuild the towns and villages which they had burned .
<start> Id ea maxime ratione fecit , quod noluit eum locum unde Helvetii discesserant vacare , ne propter bonitatem agrorum Germani , qui trans Rhenum incolunt , ex suis finibus in Helvetiorum fines transirent et finitimi Galliae provinciae Allobrogibusque essent . <end>$$This he did , chiefly , on this account , because he was unwilling that the country , from which the Helvetii had departed , should be untenanted , lest the Germans , who dwell on the other side of the Rhine , should , on account of the excellence of the lands , cross over from their own territories into those of the Helvetii , and become borderers upon the province of Gaul and the Allobroges .
<start> Boios petentibus Haeduis , quod egregia virtute erant cogniti , ut in finibus suis conlocarent , concessit ; quibus illi agros dederunt quosque postea in parem iuris libertatisque condicionem atque ipsi erant receperunt . <end>$$He granted the petition of the Aedui , that they might settle the Boii , in their own territories , as these were known to be of distinguished valor , to whom they gave lands , and whom they afterward admitted to the same state of rights and freedom as themselves .
<start> Bello Helvetiorum confecto totius fere Galliae legati , principes civitatum , ad Caesarem gratulatum convenerunt : intellegere sese , tametsi pro veteribus Helvetiorum iniuriis populi Romani ab his poenas bello repetisset , tamen eam rem non minus ex usu Galliae quam populi Romani accidisse , propterea quod eo consilio florentissimis rebus domos suas Helvetii reliquissent uti toti Galliae bellum inferrent imperioque potirentur , locumque domicilio ex magna copia deligerent quem ex omni Gallia oportunissimum ac fructuosissimum iudicassent , reliquasque civitates stipendiarias haberent . <end>$$When the war with the Helvetii was concluded , embassadors from almost all parts of Gaul , the chiefs of states , assembled to congratulate Caesar , that they were well aware , that , although he had taken vengeance on the Helvetii in war , for the old wrong done by them to the Roman people , yet that circumstance had happened no less to the benefit of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people , because the Helvetii , while their affairs were most flourishing , had quitted their country with the design of making war upon the whole of Gaul , and seizing the government of it , and selecting , out of a great abundance , that spot for an abode , which they should judge to be the most convenient and most productive of all Gaul , and hold the rest of the states as tributaries .
<start> Petierunt uti sibi concilium totius Galliae in diem certam indicere idque Caesaris facere voluntate liceret : sese habere quasdam res quas ex communi consensu ab eo petere vellent . <end>$$They requested that they might be allowed to proclaim an assembly of the whole of Gaul for a particular day , and to do that with Caesar's permission , that they had some things which , with the general consent , they wished to ask of him .
<start> Ea re permissa diem concilio constituerunt et iure iurando ne quis enuntiaret , nisi quibus communi consilio mandatum esset , inter se sanxerunt . <end>$$This request having been granted , they appointed a day for the assembly , and ordained by an oath with each other , that no one should disclose except those to whom this should be assigned by the general assembly .
<start> Eo concilio dimisso , idem principes civitatum qui ante fuerant ad Caesarem reverterunt petieruntque uti sibi secreto in occulto de sua omniumque salute cum eo agere liceret . <end>$$When that assembly was dismissed , the same chiefs of states , who had before been to Caesar , returned , and asked that they might be allowed to treat with him privately concerning the safety of themselves and of all .
<start> Ea re impetrata sese omnes flentes Caesari ad pedes proiecerunt : non minus se id contendere et laborare ne ea quae dixissent enuntiarentur quam uti ea quae vellent impetrarent , propterea quod , si enuntiatum esset , summum in cruciatum se venturos viderent . <end>$$That request having been obtained , they all threw themselves in tears at Caesar's feet , that they no less begged and earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed , than that they might obtain those things which they wished for ; inasmuch as they saw , that , if a disclosure was made , they should be put to the greatest tortures .
<start> Locutus est pro his Diviciacus Haeduus : Galliae totius factiones esse duas ; harum alterius principatum tenere Haeduos , alterius Arvernos . <end>$$For these Diviciacus the Aeduan spoke and told him : That there were two parties in the whole of Gaul : that the Aedui stood at the head of one of these , the Arverni of the other .
<start> Hi cum tantopere de potentatu inter se multos annos contenderent , factum esse uti ab Arvernis Sequanisque Germani mercede arcesserentur . <end>$$After these had been violently struggling with one another for the superiority for many years , it came to pass that the Germans were called in for hire by the Arverni and the Sequani .
<start> Horum primo circiter milia XV Rhenum transisse ; postea quam agros et cultum et copias Gallorum homines feri ac barbari adamassent , traductos plures ; nunc esse in Gallia ad C et XX milium numerum Cum his Haeduos eorumque clientes semel atque iterum armis contendisse ; magnam calamitatem pulsos accepisse , omnem nobilitatem , omnem senatum , omnem equitatum amisisse . <end>$$That about 15 , 000 of them had at first crossed the Rhine : but after that these wild and savage men had become enamored of the lands and the refinement and the abundance of the Gauls , more were brought over , that there were now as many as 120 , 000 of them in Gaul : that with these the Aedui and their dependents had repeatedly struggled in arms-that they had been routed , and had sustained a great calamity-had lost all their nobility , all their senate , all their cavalry .
<start> Quibus proeliis calamitatibusque fractos , qui et sua virtute et populi Romani hospitio atque amicitia plurimum ante in Gallia potuissent , coactos esse Sequanis obsides dare nobilissimos civitatis et iure iurando civitatem obstringere sese neque obsides repetituros neque auxilium a populo Romano imploraturos neque recusaturos quo minus perpetuo sub illorum dicione atque imperio essent . <end>$$And that broken by such engagements and calamities , although they had formerly been very powerful in Gaul , both from their own valor and from the Roman people's hospitality and friendship , they were now compelled to give the chief nobles of their state , as hostages to the Sequani , and to bind their state by an oath , that they would neither demand hostages in return , nor supplicate aid from the Roman people , nor refuse to be forever under their sway and empire .
<start> Unum se esse ex omni civitate Haeduorum qui adduci non potuerit ut iuraret aut liberos suos obsides daret . <end>$$That he was the only one out of all the state of the Aedui , who could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as hostages .
<start> Ob eam rem se ex civitate profugisse et Romam ad senatum venisse auxilium postulatum , quod solus neque iure iurando neque obsidibus teneretur . <end>$$On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the senate at Rome to beseech aid , as he alone was bound neither by oath nor hostages .
<start> Sed peius victoribus Sequanis quam Haeduis victis accidisse , propterea quod Ariovistus , rex Germanorum , in eorum finibus consedisset tertiamque partem agri Sequani , qui esset optimus totius Galliae , occupavisset et nunc de altera parte tertia Sequanos decedere iuberet , propterea quod paucis mensibus ante Harudum milia hominum XXIIII ad eum venissent , quibus locus ac sedes pararentur . <end>$$But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the vanquished Aedui , for Ariovistus the king of the Germans , had settled in their territories , and had seized upon a third of their land , which was the best in the whole of Gaul , and was now ordering them to depart from another third part , because a few months previously 24 , 000 men of the Harudes had come to him , for whom room and settlements must be provided .
<start> Futurum esse paucis annis uti omnes ex Galliae finibus pellerentur atque omnes Germani Rhenum transirent ; neque enim conferendum esse Gallicum cum Germanorum agro neque hanc consuetudinem victus cum illa comparandam . <end>$$The consequence would be , that in a few years they would all be driven from the territories of Gaul , and all the Germans would cross the Rhine ; for neither must the land of Gaul be compared with the land of the Germans , nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a level with that of the former .
<start> Ariovistum autem , ut semel Gallorum copias proelio vicerit , quod proelium factum sit ad Magetobrigam , superbe et crudeliter imperare , obsides nobilissimi cuiusque liberos poscere et in eos omnia exempla cruciatusque edere , si qua res non ad nutum aut ad voluntatem eius facta sit . <end>$$Moreover , Ariovistus , no sooner did he defeat the forces of the Gauls in a battle which took place at Magetobriga , than to lord it haughtily and cruelly , to demand as hostages the children of all the principal nobles , and wreak on them every kind of cruelty , if every thing was not done at his nod or pleasure ; that he was a savage , passionate , and reckless man , and that his commands could no longer be borne .
<start> Hominem esse barbarum , iracundum , temerarium : non posse eius imperia diutius sustineri Nisi quid in Caesare populoque Romano sit auxilii , omnibus Gallis idem esse faciendum quod Helvetii fecerint , ut domo emigrent , aliud domicilium , alias sedes , remotas a Germanis , petant fortunamque , quaecumque accidat , experiantur . <end>$$Unless there was some aid in Caesar and the Roman people , the Gauls must all do the same thing that the Helvetii have done , emigrate from their country , and seek another dwelling place , other settlements remote from the Germans , and try whatever fortune may fall to their lot .
<start> Haec si enuntiata Ariovisto sint , non dubitare quin de omnibus obsidibus qui apud eum sint gravissimum supplicium sumat Caesarem vel auctoritate sua atque exercitus vel recenti victoria vel nomine populi Romani deterrere posse ne maior multitudo Germanorum Rhenum traducatur , Galliamque omnem ab Ariovisti iniuria posse defendere . <end>$$If these things were to be disclosed to Ariovistus , that he doubts not that he would inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in his possession , that Caesar could , either by his own influence and by that of his army , or by his late victory , or by name of the Roman people , intimidate him , so as to prevent a greater number of Germans being brought over the Rhine , and could protect all Gaul from the outrages of Ariovistus .
<start> Hac oratione ab Diviciaco habita omnes qui aderant magno fletu auxilium a Caesare petere coeperunt . <end>$$When this speech had been delivered by Diviciacus , all who were present began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of Caesar .
<start> Animadvertit Caesar unos ex omnibus Sequanos nihil earum rerum facere quas ceteri facerent sed tristes capite demisso terram intueri . <end>$$Caesar noticed that the Sequani were the only people of all who did none of those things which the others did , but , with their heads bowed down , gazed on the earth in sadness .
<start> Eius rei quae causa esset miratus ex ipsis quaesiit . <end>$$Wondering what was the reason of this conduct , he inquired of themselves .
<start> Nihil Sequani respondere , sed in eadem tristitia taciti permanere . <end>$$No reply did the Sequani make , but silently continued in the same sadness .
<start> Cum ab his saepius quaereret neque ullam omnino vocem exprimere posset , idem Diviacus Haeduus respondit : hoc esse miseriorem et graviorem fortunam Sequanorum quam reliquorum , quod soli ne in occulto quidem queri neque auxilium implorare auderent absentisque Ariovisti crudelitatem , velut si coram adesset , horrerent , propterea quod reliquis tamen fugae facultas daretur , Sequanis vero , qui intra fines suos Ariovistum recepissent , quorum oppida omnia in potestate eius essent , omnes cruciatus essent perferendi . <end>$$When he had repeatedly inquired of them and could not elicit any answer at all , the same Diviciacus the Aeduan answered , that—the lot of the Sequani was more wretched and grievous than that of the rest , on this account , because they alone durst not even in secret complain or supplicate aid ; and shuddered at the cruelty of Ariovistus absent , just as if he were present ; for , to the rest , despite of every thing there was an opportunity of flight given ; but all tortures must be endured by the Sequani , who had admitted Ariovistus within their territories , and whose towns were all in his power .
<start> His rebus cognitis Caesar Gallorum animos verbis confirmavit pollicitusque est sibi eam rem curae futuram ; magnam se habere spem et beneficio suo et auctoritate adductum Ariovistum finem iniuriis facturum . <end>$$Caesar , on being informed of these things , cheered the minds of the Gauls with his words , and promised that this affair should be an object of his concern , that he had great hopes that Ariovistus , induced both by his kindness and his power , would put an end to his oppression .
<start> Et secundum ea multae res eum hortabantur quare sibi eam rem cogitandam et suscipiendam putaret , in primis quod Haeduos , fratres consanguineosque saepe numero a senatu appellatos , in servitute atque dicione videbat Germanorum teneri eorumque obsides esse apud Ariovistum ac Sequanos intellegebat ; quod in tanto imperio populi Romani turpissimum sibi et rei publicae esse arbitrabatur . <end>$$That , moreover , the Germans should by degrees become accustomed to cross the Rhine , and that a great body of them should come into Gaul , he saw dangerous to the Roman people , and judged , that wild and savage men would not be likely to restrain themselves , after they had possessed themselves of all Gaul , from going forth into the province and thence marching into Italy , particularly as the Rhône separated the Sequani from our province .
<start> Ipse autem Ariovistus tantos sibi spiritus , tantam arrogantiam sumpserat , ut ferendus non videretur . <end>$$Moreover , Ariovistus , for his part , had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance , that he was felt to be quite insufferable .
<start> Quam ob rem placuit ei ut ad Ariovistum legatos mitteret , qui ab eo postularent uti aliquem locum medium utrisque conloquio deligeret : velle sese de re publica et summis utriusque rebus cum eo agere . <end>$$He therefore determined to send embassadors to Ariovistus to demand of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between the two , that he wished to treat him on state-business and matters of the highest importance to both of them .
<start> Ei legationi Ariovistus respondit : si quid ipsi a Caesare opus esset , sese ad eum venturum fuisse ; si quid ille se velit , illum ad se venire oportere . <end>$$To this embassy Ariovistus replied , that if he himself had had need of any thing from Caesar , he would have gone to him ; and that if Caesar wanted any thing from him he ought to come to him .
<start> Praeterea se neque sine exercitu in eas partes Galliae venire audere quas Caesar possideret , neque exercitum sine magno commeatu atque molimento in unum locum contrahere posse Sibi autem mirum videri quid in sua Gallia , quam bello vicisset , aut Caesari aut omnino populo Romano negotii esset . <end>$$That , besides , neither dare he go without an army into those parts of Gaul which Caesar had possession of , nor could he , without great expense and trouble , draw his army together to one place ; that to him , moreover , it appeared strange , what business either Caesar or the Roman people at all had in his own Gaul , which he had conquered in war .
<start> Ad haec Ariovistus respondit : ius esse belli ut qui vicissent iis quos vicissent quem ad modum vellent imperarent Item populum Romanum victis non ad alterius praescriptum , sed ad suum arbitrium imperare consuesse . <end>$$To this Ariovistus replied , that the right of war was , that they who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered , in what manner they pleased ; that in that way the Roman people were wont to govern the nations which they had conquered , not according to the dictation of any other , but according to their own discretion .
<start> Si ipse populo Romano non praescriberet quem ad modum suo iure uteretur , non oportere se a populo Romano in suo iure impediri Haeduos sibi , quoniam belli fortunam temptassent et armis congressi ac superati essent , stipendiarios esse factos Magnam Caesarem iniuriam facere , qui suo adventu vectigalia sibi deteriora faceret Haeduis se obsides redditurum non esse neque his neque eorum sociis iniuria bellum inlaturum , si in eo manerent quod convenisset stipendiumque quotannis penderent ; si id non fecissent , longe iis fraternum nomen populi Romani afuturum . <end>$$If he for his part did not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner in which they were to exercise their right , he ought not to be obstructed by the Roman people in his right ; that the Aedui , inasmuch as they had tried the fortune of war and had engaged in arms and been conquered , had become tributaries to him ; that Caesar was doing a great injustice , in that by his arrival he was making his revenues less valuable to him ; that he should not restore their hostages to the Aedui , but should not make war wrongfully either upon them or their allies , if they abided by that which had been agreed on , and paid their tribute annually : if they did not continue to do that , the Roman people's name of 'brothers' would avail them naught .
<start> Quod sibi Caesar denuntiaret se Haeduorum iniurias non neglecturum , neminem secum sine sua pernicie contendisse . <end>$$As to Caesar's threatening him , that he would not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui , that no one had ever entered into a contest with him without utter ruin to himself .
<start> Cum vellet , congrederetur : intellecturum quid invicti Germani , exercitatissimi in armis , qui inter annos XIIII tectum non subissent , virtute possent . <end>$$That Caesar might enter the lists when he chose ; he would feel what the invincible Germans , well-trained beyond all others to arms , who for fourteen years had not been beneath a roof , could achieve by their valor .
<start> Haec eodem tempore Caesari mandata referebantur et legati ab Haeduis et a Treveris veniebant : Haedui questum quod Harudes , qui nuper in Galliam transportati essent , fines eorum popularentur : sese ne obsidibus quidem datis pacem Ariovisti redimere potuisse ; Treveri autem , pagos centum Sueborum ad ripas Rheni consedisse , qui Rhenum transire conarentur ; his praeesse Nasuam et Cimberium fratres . <end>$$At the same time that this message was delivered to Caesar , embassadors came from the Aedui and the Treviri ; from the Aedui to complain that the Harudes , who had lately been brought over into Gaul , were ravaging their territories ; that they had not been able to purchase peace from Ariovistus , even by giving hostages : and from the Treviri , that a hundred cantons of the Suevi had encamped on the banks of the Rhine , and were attempting to cross it ; that the brothers , Nasuas and Cimberius , headed them .
<start> Quibus rebus Caesar vehementer commotus maturandum sibi existimavit , ne , si nova manus Sueborum cum veteribus copiis Ariovisti sese coniunxisset , minus facile resisti posset . <end>$$Being greatly alarmed at these things , Caesar thought that he ought to use all dispatch , lest , if this new band of Suevi should unite with the old troops of Ariovistus , he might be less easily withstood .
<start> Itaque re frumentaria quam celerrime potuit comparata magnis itineribus ad Ariovistum contendit . <end>$$Having therefore , as quickly as he could , provided a supply of corn , he hastened to Ariovistus by forced marches .
<start> Cum tridui viam processisset , nuntiatum est ei Ariovistum cum suis omnibus copiis ad occupandum Vesontionem , quod est oppidum maximum Sequanorum , contendere  . <end>$$When he had proceeded three days' journey , word was brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on Vesontio , which is the largest town of the Sequani , and had advanced three days' journey from its territories .
<start> Huc Caesar magnis nocturnis diurnisque itineribus contendit occupatoque oppido ibi praesidium conlocat . <end>$$Hither Caesar hastens by forced marches by night and day , and , after having seized the town , stations a garrison there .
<start> Dum paucos dies ad Vesontionem rei frumentariae commeatusque causa moratur , ex percontatione nostrorum vocibusque Gallorum ac mercatorum , qui ingenti magnitudine corporum Germanos , incredibili virtute atque exercitatione in armis esse praedicabant (saepe numero sese cum his congressos ne vultum quidem atque aciem oculorum dicebant ferre potuisse) , tantus subito timor omnem exercitum occupavit ut non mediocriter omnium mentes animosque perturbaret . <end>$$While he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio , on account of corn and provisions ; from the inquiries of our men and the reports of the Gauls and traders —so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army , as to discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree .
<start> Hic primum ortus est a tribunis militum , praefectis , reliquisque qui ex urbe amicitiae causa Caesarem secuti non magnum in re militari usum habebant : quorum alius alia causa inlata , quam sibi ad proficiscendum necessariam esse diceret , petebat ut eius voluntate discedere liceret ; non nulli pudore adducti , ut timoris suspicionem vitarent , remanebant . <end>$$This first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers , the prefects and the rest , who , having followed Caesar from the city from motives of friendship , had no great experience in military affairs .
<start> Hi neque vultum fingere neque interdum lacrimas tenere poterant : abditi in tabernaculis aut suum fatum querebantur aut cum familiaribus suis commune periculum miserabantur . <end>$$And alleging , some of them one reason , some another , which they said made it necessary for them to depart , they requested that by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw ; some , influenced by shame , stayed behind in order that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice .
<start> Horum vocibus ac timore paulatim etiam ii qui magnum in castris usum habebant , milites centurionesque quique equitatui praeerant , perturbabantur . <end>$$By the expressions and cowardice of these men , even those who possessed great experience in the camp , both soldiers and centurions , and those who were in command of the cavalry , were gradually disconcerted .
<start> Qui se ex his minus timidos existimari volebant , non se hostem vereri , sed angustias itineris et magnitudinem silvarum quae intercederent inter ipsos atque Ariovistum , aut rem frumentariam , ut satis commode supportari posset , timere dicebant . <end>$$Such of them as wished to be considered less alarmed , said that they did not dread the enemy , but feared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests which lay between them and Ariovistus , or else that the supplies could not be brought up readily enough .
<start> Non nulli etiam Caesari nuntiabant , cum castra moveri ac signa ferri iussisset , non fore dicto audientes milites neque propter timorem signa laturos . <end>$$Some even declared to Caesar , that when he gave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops to advance , the soldiers would not be obedient to the command , nor advance in consequence of their fear .
<start> Haec cum animadvertisset , convocato consilio omniumque ordinum ad id consilium adhibitis centurionibus , vehementer eos incusavit : primum , quod aut quam in partem aut quo consilio ducerentur sibi quaerendum aut cogitandum putarent . <end>$$When Caesar observed these things , having called a council , and summoned to it the centurions of all the companies , he severely reprimanded them , particularly , for supposing that it belonged to them to inquire or conjecture , either in what direction they were marching , or with what object .
<start> Ariovistum se consule cupidissime populi Romani amicitiam adpetisse ; cur hunc tam temere quisquam ab officio discessurum iudicaret ? Sibi quidem persuaderi cognitis suis postulatis atque aequitate condicionum perspecta eum neque suam neque populi Romani gratiam repudiaturum . <end>$$That Ariovistus , during his consulship , had most anxiously sought after the friendship of the Roman people ; why should any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty ? He for his part was persuaded , that , when his demands were known and the fairness of the terms considered , he would reject neither his nor the Roman people's favor .
<start> Quod si furore atque amentia impulsum bellum intulisset , quid tandem vererentur ? Aut cur de sua virtute aut de ipsius diligentia desperarent ? Factum eius hostis periculum patrum nostrorum memoria Cimbris et Teutonis a Gaius Mario pulsis ; factum etiam nuper in Italia servili tumultu , quos tamen aliquid usus ac disciplina , quam a nobis accepissent , sublevarint . <end>$$But even if , driven on by rage and madness , he should make war upon them , what after all were they afraid of ? —or why should they despair either of their own valor or of his zeal ? Of that enemy a trial had been made within our fathers' recollection , when , on the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Gaius Marius , the army was regarded as having deserved no less praise than their commander himself .
<start> Ex quo iudicari posse quantum haberet in se boni constantia , propterea quod quos aliquam diu inermes sine causa timuissent hos postea armatos ac victores superassent . <end>$$It had been made lately , too , in Italy , during the rebellion of the slaves , whom , however , the experience and training which they had received from us , assisted in some respect .
<start> Denique hos esse eosdem Germanos quibuscum saepe numero Helvetii congressi non solum in suis sed etiam in illorum finibus plerumque superarint , qui tamen pares esse nostro exercitui non potuerint . <end>$$From which a judgment might be formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as those whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed , they had afterward vanquished , when well armed and flushed with success .
<start> Si quos adversum proelium et fuga Gallorum commoveret , hos , si quaererent , reperire posse diuturnitate belli defatigatis Gallis Ariovistum , cum multos menses castris se ac paludibus tenuisset neque sui potestatem fecisset , desperantes iam de pugna et dispersos subito adortum magis ratione et consilio quam virtute vicisse . <end>$$In short , that these were the same men whom the Helvetii , in frequent encounters , not only in their own territories , but also in theirs , have generally vanquished , and yet can not have been a match for our army .
<start> Qui suum timorem in rei frumentariae simulationem angustiasque itineris conferrent , facere arroganter , cum aut de officio imperatoris desperare aut praescribere viderentur . <end>$$That those who ascribed their fear to a pretense about the supplies and the narrowness of the roads , acted presumptuously , as they seemed either to distrust their general's discharge of his duty , or to dictate to him .
<start> Haec sibi esse curae ; frumentum Sequanos , Leucos , Lingones subministrare , iamque esse in agris frumenta matura ; de itinere ipsos brevi tempore iudicaturos . <end>$$That these things were his concern ; that the Sequani , the Leuci , and the Lingones were to furnish the corn ; and that it was already ripe in the fields ; that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves .
<start> Quod non fore dicto audientes neque signa laturi dicantur , nihil se ea re commoveri : scire enim , quibuscumque exercitus dicto audiens non fuerit , aut male re gesta fortunam defuisse aut aliquo facinore comperto avaritiam esse convictam . <end>$$As to its being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command , or advance , he was not at all disturbed at that ; for he knew , that in the case of all those whose army had not been obedient to command , either upon some mismanagement of an affair , fortune had deserted them , or , that upon some crime being discovered , covetousness had been clearly proved  .
<start> Suam innocentiam perpetua vita , felicitatem Helvetiorum bello esse perspectam . <end>$$His integrity had been seen throughout his whole life , his good fortune in the war with the Helvetii .
<start> Itaque se quod in longiorem diem conlaturus fuisset repraesentaturum et proxima nocte de quarta , vigilia castra moturum , ut quam primum intellegere posset utrum apud eos pudor atque officium an timor plus valeret . <end>$$That he would therefore instantly set about what he had intended to put off till a more distant day , and would break up his camp the next night , in the fourth watch , that he might ascertain , as soon as possible , whether a sense of honor and duty , or whether fear had more influence with them .
<start> Quod si praeterea nemo sequatur , tamen se cum sola decima legione iturum , de qua non dubitet , sibique eam praetoriam cohortem futuram . <end>$$But that , if no one else should follow , yet he would go with only the tenth legion , of which he had no misgivings , and it should be his praetorian cohort .
<start> Huic legioni Caesar et indulserat praecipue et propter virtutem confidebat maxime . <end>$$This legion Caesar had both greatly favored , and in it , on account of its valor , placed the greatest confidence .
<start> Hac oratione habita mirum in modum conversae sunt omnium mentes summaque alacritas et cupiditas belli gerendi innata est , princepsque X legio per tribunos militum ei gratias egit quod de se optimum iudicium fecisset , seque esse ad bellum gerendum paratissimam confirmavit . <end>$$Upon the delivery of this speech , the minds of all were changed in a surprising manner , and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecuting the war were engendered ; and the tenth legion was the first to return thanks to him , through their military tribunes , for his having expressed this most favorable opinion of them ; and assured him that they were quite ready to prosecute the war .
<start> Deinde reliquae legiones cum tribunis militum et primorum ordinum centurionibus egerunt uti Caesari satis facerent : se neque umquam dubitasse neque timuisse neque de summa belli suum iudicium sed imperatoris esse existimavisse . <end>$$Then , the other legions endeavored , through their military tribunes and the centurions of the principal companies , to excuse themselves to Caesar , that they had never either doubted or feared , or supposed that the determination of the conduct of the war was theirs and not their general's .
<start> Eorum satisfactione accepta et itinere exquisito per Diviciacum , quod ex Gallis ei maximam fidem habebat , ut milium amplius quinquaginta circuitu locis apertis exercitum duceret , de quarta vigilia , ut dixerat , profectus est . <end>$$Having accepted their excuse , and having had the road carefully reconnoitered by Diviciacus , because in him of all others he had the greatest faith that by a circuitous route of more than fifty miles he might lead his army through open parts ; he then set out in the fourth watch , as he had said  .
<start> Septimo die , cum iter non intermitteret , ab exploratoribus certior factus est Ariovisti copias a nostris milia passuum IIII et XX abesse . <end>$$On the seventh day , as he did not discontinue his march , he was informed by scouts that the forces of Ariovistus were only four and twenty miles distant from ours .
<start> Cognito Caesaris adventu Ariovistus legatos ad eum mittit : quod antea de conloquio postulasset , id per se fieri licere , quoniam propius accessisset seque id sine periculo facere posse existimaret . <end>$$Upon being apprized of Caesar's arrival , Ariovistus sends embassadors to him , that what he had before requested as to a conference , might now , as far as his permission went , take place , since he had approached nearer , and he considered that he might now do it without danger .
<start> Caesar , quod neque conloquium interposita causa tolli volebat neque salutem suam Gallorum equitatui committere audebat , commodissimum esse statuit omnibus equis Gallis equitibus detractis eo legionarios milites legionis X , cui quam maxime confidebat , imponere , ut praesidium quam amicissimum , si quid opus facto esset , haberet . <end>$$Meanwhile , as ambassadors were being often sent to and fro between them , Ariovistus demanded that Caesar should not bring any foot-soldier with him to the conference , that he was afraid of being ensnared by him through treachery ; that both should come accompanied by cavalry ; that he would not come on any other condition .
<start> Planities erat magna et in ea tumulus terrenus satis grandis . <end>$$There was a large plain , and in it a mound of earth of considerable size .
<start> Hic locus aequum fere spatium a castris Ariovisti et Caesaris aberat . <end>$$This spot was at nearly an equal distance from both camps .
<start> Eo , ut erat dictum , ad conloquium venerunt . <end>$$Thither , as had been appointed , they came for the conference .
<start> Legionem Caesar , quam equis devexerat , passibus CC ab eo tumulo constituit . <end>$$Caesar stationed the legion , which he had brought on horseback , 200 paces from this mound .
<start> Item equites Ariovisti pari intervallo constiterunt . <end>$$The cavalry of Ariovistus also took their stand at an equal distance .
<start> Ariovistus ex equis ut conloquerentur et praeter se denos ad conloquium adducerent postulavit . <end>$$Ariovistus then demanded that they should confer on horseback , and that , besides themselves , they should bring with them ten men each to the conference .
<start> Ubi eo ventum est , Caesar initio orationis sua senatusque in eum beneficia commemoravit , quod rex appellatus esset a senatu , quod amicus , quod munera amplissime missa ; quam rem et paucis contigisse et pro magnis hominum officiis consuesse tribui docebat ; illum , cum neque aditum neque causam postulandi iustam haberet , beneficio ac liberalitate sua ac senatus ea praemia consecutum . <end>$$When they were come to the place , Caesar , in the opening of his speech , detailed his own and the senate's favors toward him , in that he had been styled king , in that friend , by the senate-in that very considerable presents had been sent him ; which circumstance he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few , and had usually been bestowed in consideration of important personal services ; that he , although he had neither an introduction , nor a just ground for the request , had obtained these honors through the kindness and munificence of himself and the senate .
<start> Docebat etiam quam veteres quamque iustae causae necessitudinis ipsis cum Haeduis intercederent , quae senatus consulta quotiens quamque honorifica in eos facta essent , ut omni tempore totius Galliae principatum Haedui tenuissent , prius etiam quam nostram amicitiam adpetissent Populi Romani hanc esse consuetudinem , ut socios atque amicos non modo sui nihil deperdere , sed gratia , dignitate , honore auctiores velit esse ; quod vero ad amicitiam populi Romani attulissent , id iis eripi quis pati posset ? Postulavit deinde eadem quae legatis in mandatis dederat : ne aut Haeduis aut eorum sociis bellum inferret , obsides redderet , si nullam partem Germanorum domum remittere posset , at ne quos amplius Rhenum transire pateretur . <end>$$He informed him too , how old and how just were the grounds of connection that existed between themselves and the Aedui , what decrees of the senate had been passed in their favor , and how frequent and how honorable ; how from time immemorial the Aedui had held the supremacy of the whole of Gaul ; even before they had sought our friendship ; that it was the custom of the Roman people to desire not only that its allies and friends should lose none of their property , but be advanced in influence , dignity , and honor : who then could endure that what they had brought with them to the friendship of the Roman people should be torn from them ? He then made the same demands which he had commissioned the embassadors to make , that should not make war either upon the Aedui or their allies , that he should restore the hostages ; that if he could not send back to their country any part of the Germans , he should at all events suffer none of them any more to cross the Rhine .
<start> Ariovistus ad postulata Caesaris pauca respondit , de suis virtutibus multa praedicavit : transisse Rhenum sese non sua sponte , sed rogatum et arcessitum a Gallis ; non sine magna spe magnisque praemiis domum propinquosque reliquisse ; sedes habere in Gallia ab ipsis concessas , obsides ipsorum voluntate datos ; stipendium capere iure belli , quod victores victis imponere consuerint Non sese Gallis sed Gallos sibi bellum intulisse : omnes Galliae civitates ad se oppugnandum venisse ac contra se castra habuisse ; eas omnes copias a se uno proelio pulsas ac superatas esse . <end>$$Ariovistus briefly replied to the demands of Caesar ; but expatiated largely on his own virtues , that he had crossed the Rhine not of his own accord , but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls ; that he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and great rewards ; that he had settlements in Gaul , granted by the Gauls themselves ; that the hostages had been given by their good-will ; that he took by right of war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered ; that he had not made war upon the Gauls , but the Gauls upon him ; that all the states of Gaul came to attack him , and had encamped against him ; that all their forces had been routed and beaten by him in a single battle ; that if they chose to make a second trial , he was ready to encounter them again ; but if they chose to enjoy peace , it was unfair to refuse the tribute , which of their own free-will they had paid up to that time .
<start> Si iterum experiri velint , se iterum paratum esse decertare ; si pace uti velint , iniquum esse de stipendio recusare , quod sua voluntate ad id tempus pependerint . <end>$$That the friendship of the Roman people ought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard , not a detriment ; and that he sought it with that expectation .
<start> Amicitiam populi Romani sibi ornamento et praesidio , non detrimento esse oportere , atque se hac spe petisse . <end>$$But if through the Roman people the tribute was to be discontinued , and those who surrendered to be seduced from him , he would renounce the friendship of the Roman people no less heartily than he had sought it .
<start> Si per populum Romanum stipendium remittatur et dediticii subtrahantur , non minus libenter sese recusaturum populi Romani amicitiam quam adpetierit . <end>$$As to his leading over a host of Germans into Gaul , that he was doing this with a view of securing himself , not of assaulting Gaul : that there was evidence of this , in that he did not come without being invited , and in that he did not make war , but merely warded it off .
<start> Quid sibi vellet ? Cur in suas possessiones veniret ? Provinciam suam hanc esse Galliam , sicut illam nostram . <end>$$That never before this time did a Roman army go beyond the frontiers of the province of Gaul .
<start> Ut ipsi concedi non oporteret , si in nostros fines impetum faceret , sic item nos esse iniquos , quod in suo iure se interpellaremus . <end>$$What does desire ? —why come into his domains ? —that this was his province of Gaul , just as that is ours .
<start> Quod fratres a senatu Haeduos appellatos diceret , non se tam barbarum neque tam imperitum esse rerum ut non sciret neque bello Allobrogum proximo Haeduos Romanis auxilium tulisse neque ipsos in iis contentionibus quas Haedui secum et cum Sequanis habuissent auxilio populi Romani usos esse . <end>$$As it ought not to be pardoned in him , if he were to make an attack upon our territories ; so , likewise , that we were unjust , to obstruct him in his prerogative .
<start> Qui nisi decedat atque exercitum deducat ex his regionibus , sese illum non pro amico sed pro hoste habiturum . <end>$$He must feel suspicious , that Caesar , though feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in Gaul , was keeping it with the view of crushing him .
<start> Quod si eum interfecerit , multis sese nobilibus principibusque populi Romani gratum esse facturum (id se ab ipsis per eorum nuntios compertum habere) , quorum omnium gratiam atque amicitiam eius morte redimere posset . <end>$$And that unless he depart and withdraw his army from these parts , he shall regard him not as a friend , but as a foe ; and that , even if he should put him to death , he should do what would please many of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people ; he had assurance of that from themselves through their messengers , and could purchase the favor and the friendship of them all by his death .
<start> Quod si decessisset et liberam possessionem Galliae sibi tradidisset , magno se illum praemio remuneraturum et quaecumque bella geri vellet sine ullo eius labore et periculo confecturum . <end>$$But if he would depart and resign to him the free possession of Gaul , he would recompense him with a great reward , and would bring to a close whatever wars he wished to be carried on , without any trouble or risk to him .
<start> Multa a Caesare in eam sententiam dicta sunt quare negotio desistere non posset : neque suam neque populi Romani consuetudinem pati ut optime meritos socios desereret , neque se iudicare Galliam potius esse Ariovisti quam populi Romani Bello superatos esse Arvernos et Rutenos a Quintus Fabio Maximo , quibus populus Romanus ignovisset neque in provinciam redegisset neque stipendium posuisset . <end>$$Many things were stated by Caesar to the effect ; why he could not waive the business , and that neither his nor the Roman people's practice would suffer him to abandon most meritorious allies , nor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather than to the Roman people ; that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued in war by Quintus Fabius Maximus , and that the Roman people had pardoned them and had not reduced them into a province or imposed a tribute upon them .
<start> Quod si antiquissimum quodque tempus spectari oporteret , populi Romani iustissimum esse in Gallia imperium ; si iudicium senatus observari oporteret , liberam debere esse Galliam , quam bello victam suis legibus uti voluisset . <end>$$And if the most ancient period was to be regarded-then was the sovereignty of the Roman people in Gaul most just : if the decree of the Senate was to be observed , then ought Gaul to be free , which they had conquered in war , and had permitted to enjoy its own laws .
<start> Dum haec in conloquio geruntur , Caesari nuntiatum est equites Ariovisti propius tumulum accedere et ad nostros adequitare , lapides telaque in nostros coicere . <end>$$While these things are being transacted in the conference it was announced to Caesar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were approaching nearer the mound , and were riding up to our men , and casting stones and weapons at them .
<start> Caesar loquendi finem fecit seque ad suos recepit suisque imperavit ne quod omnino telum in hostes reicerent . <end>$$Caesar made an end of his speech and betook himself to his men ; and commanded them that they should by no means return a weapon upon the enemy .
<start> Nam etsi sine ullo periculo legionis delectae cum equitatu proelium fore videbat , tamen committendum non putabat ut , pulsis hostibus , dici posset eos ab se per fidem in conloquio circumventos . <end>$$For though he saw that an engagement with the cavalry would be without any danger to his chosen legion , yet he did not think proper to engage , lest , after the enemy were routed , it might be said that they had been insnared by him under the sanction of a conference .
<start> Postea quam in vulgus militum elatum est qua arrogantia in conloquio Ariovistus usus omni Gallia Romanis interdixisset , impetumque in nostros eius equites fecissent , eaque res conloquium ut diremisset , multo maior alacritas studiumque pugnandi maius exercitui iniectum est . <end>$$When it was spread abroad among the common soldiery with what haughtiness Ariovistus had behaved at the conference , and how he had ordered the Romans to quit Gaul , and how his cavalry had made an attack upon our men , and how this had broken off the conference , a much greater alacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into our army .
<start> Biduo post Ariovistus ad Caesarem legatos misit : velle se de iis rebus quae inter eos egi coeptae neque perfectae essent agere cum eo : uti aut iterum conloquio diem constitueret aut , si id minus vellet , ex suis legatis aliquem ad se mitteret . <end>$$Two days after , Ariovistus sends embassadors to Caesar , to state that he wished to treat with him about those things which had been begun to be treated of between them , but had not been concluded ; that he would either again appoint a day for a conference ; or , if he were not willing to do that , that he would send one of his as an embassador to him .
<start> Conloquendi Caesari causa visa non est , et eo magis quod pridie eius diei Germani retineri non potuerant quin tela in nostros coicerent . <end>$$There did not appear to Caesar any good reason for holding a conference ; and the more so as the day before the Germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men .
<start> Legatum ex suis sese magno cum periculo ad eum missurum et hominibus feris obiecturum existimabat . <end>$$He thought he should not without great danger send to him as embassador one of his officers , and should expose him to savage men .
<start> Commodissimum visum est Gaius Valerium Procillum , Gaius Valerii Caburi filium , summa virtute et humanitate adulescentem , cuius pater a Gaius Valerio Flacco civitate donatus erat , et propter fidem et propter linguae Gallicae scientiam , qua multa iam Ariovistus longinqua consuetudine utebatur , et quod in eo peccandi Germanis causa non esset , ad eum mittere , et una Marcus Metium , qui hospitio Ariovisti utebatur . <end>$$It seemed most proper to send to him Gaius Valerius Procillus , the son of Gaius Valerius Caburus , a young man of the highest courage and accomplishments , both on account of his fidelity and on account of his knowledge of the Gallic language , which Ariovistus , by long practice , now spoke fluently ; and because in his case the Germans would have no motive for committing violence ; and Marcus Mettius , who had shared the hospitality of Ariovistus .
<start> His mandavit quae diceret Ariovistus cognogcerent et ad se referrent . <end>$$He commissioned them to learn what Ariovistus had to say , and to report to him .
<start> Quos cum apud se in castris Ariovistus conspexisset , exercitu suo praesente conclamavit : quid ad se venirent ? an speculandi causa ? Conantes dicere prohibuit et in catenas coniecit . <end>$$But when Ariovistus saw them before him in his camp , he cried out in the presence of his army , Why were they come to him ? Was it for the purpose of acting as spies ? He stopped them when attempting to speak , and cast them into chains .
<start> Eodem die castra promovit et milibus passuum VI a Caesaris castris sub monte consedit . <end>$$The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill six miles from Caesar's camp .
<start> Postridie eius diei praeter castra Caesaris suas copias traduxit et milibus passuum duobus ultra eum castra fecit eo consilio uti frumento commeatuque qui ex Sequanis et Haeduis supportaretur Caesarem intercluderet . <end>$$The day following he led his forces past Caesar's camp , and encamped two miles beyond him ; with this design that he might cut off Caesar from the corn and provisions , which might be conveyed to him from the Sequani and the Aedui .
<start> Ex eo die dies continuos V Caesar pro castris suas copias produxit et aciem instructam habuit , ut , si vellet Ariovistus proelio contendere , ei potestas non deesset . <end>$$For five successive days from that day , Caesar drew out his forces before the camp , and put them in battle order , that , if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in battle , an opportunity might not be wanting to him .
<start> Ariovistus his omnibus diebus exercitum castris continuit , equestri proelio cotidie contendit . <end>$$Ariovistus all this time kept his army in camp : but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes .
<start> Genus hoc erat pugnae , quo se Germani exercuerant : equitum milia erant VI , totidem numero pedites velocissimi ac fortissimi , quos ex omni copia singuli singulos suae salutis causa delegerant : cum his in proeliis versabantur , ad eos se equites recipiebant ; hi , si quid erat durius , concurrebant , si qui graviore vulnere accepto equo deciderat , circumsistebant ; si quo erat longius prodeundum aut celerius recipiendum , tanta erat horum exercitatione celeritas ut iubis sublevati equorum cursum adaequarent . <end>$$The method of battle in which the Germans had practiced themselves was this There were 6 , 000 horse , and as many very active and courageous foot , one of whom each of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own protection By these they were constantly accompanied in their engagements ; to these the horse retired ; these on any emergency rushed forward ; if any one , upon receiving a very severe wound , had fallen from his horse , they stood around him : if it was necessary to advance further than usual , or to retreat more rapidly , so great , from practice , was their swiftness , that , supported by the manes of the horses , they could keep pace with their speed .
<start> Ubi eum castris se tenere Caesar intellexit , ne diutius commeatu prohiberetur , ultra eum locum , quo in loco Germani consederant , circiter passus DC ab his , castris idoneum locum delegit acieque triplici instructa ad eum locum venit . <end>$$Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in camp , Caesar , that he might not any longer be cut off from provisions , chose a convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans had encamped , at about 600 paces from them , and having drawn up his army in three lines , marched to that place .
<start> Primam et secundam aciem in armis esse , tertiam castra munire iussit . <end>$$This place was distant from the enemy about 600 paces , as has been stated .
<start> Eo circiter hominum XVI milia expedita cum omni equitatu Ariovistus misit , quae copiae nostros terrerent et munitione prohiberent . <end>$$Thither Ariovistus sent light troops , about 16 , 000 men in number , with all his cavalry ; which forces were to intimidate our men , and hinder them in their fortification .
<start> Nihilo setius Caesar , ut ante constituerat , duas acies hostem propulsare , tertiam opus perficere iussit . <end>$$Caesar nevertheless , as he had before arranged , ordered two lines to drive off the enemy : the third to execute the work .
<start> Proximo die instituto suo Caesar ex castris utrisque copias suas eduxit paulumque a maioribus castris progressus aciem instruxit hostibusque pugnandi potestatem fecit . <end>$$The next day , according to his custom , Caesar led out his forces from both camps , and having advanced a little from the larger one , drew up his line of battle , and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting .
<start> Ubi ne tum quidem eos prodire intellexit , circiter meridiem exercitum in castra reduxit . <end>$$When he found that they did not even then come out he led back his army into camp about noon .
<start> Tum demum Ariovistus partem suarum copiarum , quae castra minora oppugnaret , misit . <end>$$Then at last Ariovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp .
<start> Acriter utrimque usque ad vesperum pugnatum est . <end>$$The battle was vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening .
<start> Solis occasu suas copias Ariovistus multis et inlatis et acceptis vulneribus in castra reduxit . <end>$$At sunset , after many wounds had been inflicted and received , Ariovistus led back his forces into camp .
<start> Cum ex captivis quaereret Caesar quam ob rem Ariovistus proelio non decertaret , hanc reperiebat causam , quod apud Germanos ea consuetudo esset ut matres familiae eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus declararent utrum proelium committi ex usu esset necne ; eas ita dicere : non esse fas Germanos superare , si ante novam lunam proelio contendissent . <end>$$When Caesar inquired of his prisoners , wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement , he discovered this to be the reason-that among the Germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and divination , whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not ; that they had said , that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer , if they engaged in battle before the new moon .
<start> Postridie eius diei Caesar praesidio utrisque castris quod satis esse visum est reliquit , alarios omnes in conspectu hostium pro castris minoribus constituit , quod minus multitudine militum legionariorum pro hostium numero valebat , ut ad speciem alariis uteretur ; ipse triplici instructa acie usque ad castra hostium accessit . <end>$$The day following , Caesar left what seemed sufficient as a guard for both camps ; drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the enemy , before the lesser camp , because he was not very powerful in the number of legionary soldiers , considering the number of the enemy ; that he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance .
<start> Tum demum necessario Germani suas copias castris eduxerunt generatimque constituerunt paribus intervallis , Harudes , Marcomanos , Tribocos , Vangiones , Nemetes , Sedusios , Suebos , omnemque aciem suam raedis et carris circumdederunt , ne qua spes in fuga relinqueretur . <end>$$He himself , having drawn up his army in three lines , advanced to the camp of the enemy Then at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces out of camp , and disposed them canton by canton , at equal distances , the Harudes , Marcomanni , Tribocci , Vangiones , Nemetes , Sedusii , Suevi ; and surrounded their whole army with their chariots and wagons , that no hope might be left in flight .
<start> Eo mulieres imposuerunt , quae ad proelium proficiscentes milites passis manibus flentes implorabant ne se in servitutem Romanis traderent . <end>$$On these they placed their women , who , with disheveled hair and in tears , entreated the soldiers , as they went forward to battle , not to deliver them into slavery to the Romans .
<start> Caesar singulis legionibus singulos legatos et quaestorem praefecit , uti eos testes suae quisque virtutis haberet ; ipse a dextro cornu , quod eam partem minime firmam hostium esse animadverterat , proelium commisit . <end>$$Caesar appointed over each legion a legate and a quaestor , that every one might have them as witnesses of his valor .
<start> Ita nostri acriter in hostes signo dato impetum fecerunt itaque hostes repente celeriterque procurrerunt , ut spatium pila in hostes coiciendi non daretur . <end>$$He himself began the battle at the head of the right wing , because he had observed that part of the enemy to be the least strong .
<start> At Germani celeriter ex consuetudine sua phalange facta impetus gladiorum exceperunt . <end>$$But the Germans , according to their custom , rapidly forming a phalanx , sustained the attack of our swords .
<start> Reperti sunt complures nostri qui in phalanga insilirent et scuta manibus revellerent et desuper vulnerarent . <end>$$There were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the phalanx , and with their hands tore away the shields , and wounded the enemy from above .
<start> Cum hostium acies a sinistro cornu pulsa atque in fugam coniecta esset , a dextro cornu vehementer multitudine suorum nostram aciem premebant . <end>$$Although the army of the enemy was routed on the left wing and put to flight , they pressed heavily on our men from the right wing , by the great number of their troops .
<start> Id cum animadvertisset Publius Crassus adulescens , qui equitatui praeerat , quod expeditior erat quam ii qui inter aciem versabantur , tertiam aciem laborantibus nostris subsidio misit . <end>$$On observing which , Publius Crassus , a young man , who commanded the cavalry—as he was more disengaged than those who were employed in the fight-sent the third line as a relief to our men who were in distress .
<start> Ita proelium restitutum est , atque omnes hostes terga verterunt nec prius fugere destiterunt quam ad flumen Rhenum milia passuum ex eo loco circiter L pervenerunt . <end>$$Thereupon the engagement was renewed , and all the enemy turned their backs , nor did they cease to flee until they arrived at the river Rhine , about fifty miles from that place .
<start> Ibi perpauci aut viribus confisi tranare contenderunt aut lintribus inventis sibi salutem reppererunt . <end>$$There some few , either relying on their strength , endeavored to swim over , or , finding boats , procured their safety .
<start> In his fuit Ariovistus , qui naviculam deligatam ad ripam nactus ea profugit ; reliquos omnes consecuti equites nostri interfecerunt . <end>$$Among the latter was Ariovistus , who meeting with a small vessel tied to the bank , escaped in it ; our horse pursued and slew all the rest of them .
<start> Duae fuerunt Ariovisti uxores , una Sueba natione , quam domo secum eduxerat , altera Norica , regis Voccionis soror , quam in Gallia duxerat a fratre missam : utraque in ea fuga periit ; duae filiae : harum altera occisa , altera capta est . <end>$$Ariovistus had two wives , one a Suevan by nation , whom he brought with him from home ; the other a Norican , the sister of king Vocion , whom he had married in Gaul , she having been sent by her brother .
<start> Gaius Valerius Procillus , cum a custodibus in fuga trinis catenis vinctus traheretur , in ipsum Caesarem hostes equitatu insequentem incidit . <end>$$Both perished in that flight Of their two daughters , one was slain , the other captured .
<start> Quae quidem res Caesari non minorem quam ipsa victoria voluptatem attulit , quod hominem honestissimum provinciae Galliae , suum familiarem et hospitem , ereptum ex manibus hostium sibi restitutum videbat neque eius calamitate de tanta voluptate et gratulatione quicquam fortuna deminuerat . <end>$$Gaius Valerius Procillus , as he was being dragged by his guards in the fight , bound with a triple chain , fell into the hands of Caesar himself , as he was pursuing the enemy with his cavalry .
<start> Item Marcus Metius repertus et ad eum reductus est . <end>$$Marcus Mettius , also , was found and brought back to him .
<start> Hoc proelio trans Rhenum nuntiato , Suebi , qui ad ripas Rheni venerant , domum reverti coeperunt ; quos ubi qui proximi Rhenum incolunt perterritos senserunt , insecuti magnum ex iis numerum occiderunt . <end>$$This battle having been reported beyond the Rhine , the Suevi , who had come to the banks of that river , began to return home , when the Ubii , who dwelt nearest to the Rhine , pursuing them , while much alarmed , slew a great number of them .
<start> Cum esset Caesar in citeriore Gallia , ita uti supra demonstravimus , crebri ad eum rumores adferebantur litterisque item Labieni certior fiebat omnes Belgas , quam tertiam esse Galliae partem dixeramus , contra populum Romanum coniurare obsidesque inter se dare Coniurandi has esse causas : primum quod vererentur ne , omni pacata Gallia , ad eos exercitus noster adduceretur ; deinde quod ab non nullis Gallis sollicitarentur , partim qui , ut Germanos diutius in Gallia versari noluerant , ita populi Romani exercitum hiemare atque inveterascere in Gallia moleste ferebant , partim qui mobilitate et levitate animi novis imperiis studebant ; ab non nullis etiam quod in Gallia a potentioribus atque iis qui ad conducendos homines facultates habebant vulgo regna occupabantur ; qui minus facile eam rem imperio nostro consequi poterant . <end>$$While Caesar was in winter quarters in Hither Gaul , as we have shown above , frequent reports were brought to him , and he was also informed by letters from Labienus , that all the Belgae , who we have said are a third part of Gaul , were entering into a confederacy against the Roman people , and giving hostages to one another ; that the reasons of the confederacy were these-first , because they feared that , after all Gaul was subdued , our army would be led against them ; secondly , because they were instigated by several of the Gauls ; some of whom as they had been unwilling that the Germans should remain any longer in Gaul , so they were dissatisfied that the army of the Roman people should pass the winter in it , and settle there ; and others of them , from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition , were anxious for a revolution ; by several , also , because the government in Gaul was generally seized upon by the more powerful persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops , and they could less easily effect this object under our dominion .
<start> His nuntiis litterisque commotus Caesar duas legiones in citeriore Gallia novas conscripsit et inita aestate in ulteriorem Galliam qui deduceret Quintus Pedium legatum misit . <end>$$Alarmed by these tidings and letters , Caesar levied two new legions in Hither Gaul , and , at the beginning of summer , sent Quintus Pedius , his legate , to conduct them further into Gaul .
<start> Ipse , cum primum pabuli copia esse inciperet , ad exercitum venit . <end>$$He , himself , as soon as there began to be plenty of forage , came to the army .
<start> Dat negotium Senonibus reliquisque Gallis qui finitimi Belgis erant uti ea quae apud eos gerantur cognoscant seque de his rebus certiorem faciant . <end>$$He gives a commission to the Senones and the other Gauls who were neighbors of the Belgae , to learn what is going on among them , and inform him of these matters .
<start> Hi constanter omnes nuntiaverunt manus cogi , exercitum in unum locum conduci . <end>$$These all uniformly reported that troops were being raised , and that an army was being collected in one place .
<start> Tum vero dubitandum non existimavit quin ad eos proficisceretur Re frumentaria provisa castra movet diebusque circiter XV ad fines Belgarum pervenit . <end>$$Then , indeed , he thought that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding toward them , and having provided supplies , moves his camp , and in about fifteen days arrives at the territories of the Belgae .
<start> Eo cum de improviso celeriusque omnium opinione venisset , Remi , qui proximi Galliae ex Belgis sunt , ad eum legatos Iccium et Andebrogium , primos civitatis , miserunt , qui dicerent se suaque omnia in fidem atque potestatem populi Romani permittere , neque se cum reliquis Belgis consensisse neque contra populum Romanum coniurasse , paratosque esse et obsides dare et imperata facere et oppidis recipere et frumento ceterisque rebus iuvare ; reliquos omnes Belgas in armis esse , Germanosque qui cis Rhenum incolant sese cum his coniunxisse , tantumque esse eorum omnium furorem ut ne Suessiones quidem , fratres consanguineosque suos , qui eodem iure et isdem legibus utantur , unum imperium unumque magistratum cum ipsis habeant , deterrere potuelint quin cum iis consentirent . <end>$$As he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner than any one anticipated , the Remi , who are the nearest of the Belgae to Gaul , sent to him Iccius and Andecombogius , the principal persons of the state , as their embassadors : to tell him that they surrendered themselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of the Roman people : and that they had neither combined with the rest of the Belgae , nor entered into any confederacy against the Roman people : and were prepared to give hostages , to obey his commands , to receive him into their towns , and to aid him with corn and other things ; that all the rest of the Belgae were in arms ; and that the Germans , who dwell on this side of the Rhine , had joined themselves to them ; and that so great was the infatuation of them all , that they could not restrain even the Suessiones , their own brethren and kinsmen , who enjoy the same rights , and the , same laws , and who have one government and one magistracy with themselves , from uniting with them .
<start> Cum ab iis quaereret quae civitates quantaeque in armis essent et quid in bello possent , sic reperiebat : plerosque Belgos esse ortos a Germanis Rhenumque antiquitus traductos propter loci fertilitatem ibi consedisse Gallosque qui ea loca incolerent expulisse , solosque esse qui , patrum nostrorum memoria omni Gallia vexata , Teutonos Cimbrosque intra suos fines ingredi prohibuerint ; qua ex re fieri uti earum rerum memoria magnam sibi auctoritatem Illagnosque spiritus in re militari sumerent . <end>$$When Caesar inquired of them what states were in arms , how powerful they were , and what they could do , in war , he received the following information : that the greater part of the Belgae were sprung from the Germans , and that having crossed the Rhine at an early period , they had settled there , on account of the fertility of the country , and had driven out the Gauls who inhabited those regions ; and that they were the only people who , in the memory of our fathers , when all Gaul was overrun , had prevented the Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their territories ; the effect of which was , that , from the recollection of those events , they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness in military matters .
<start> De numero eorum omnia se habere explorata Remi dicebant , propterea quod propinquitatibus adfinitatibus quo coniuncti quantam quisque multitudinem in communi Belgarum concilio ad id bellum pollicitus sit cognoverint . <end>$$The Remi said , that they had known accurately every thing respecting their number , because being united to them by neighborhood and by alliances , they had learned what number each state had in the general council of the Belgae promised for that war .
<start> Plurimum inter eos Bellovacos et virtute et auctoritate et hominum numero valere : hos posse conficere armata milia centum , pollicitos ex eo numero electa milia LX totiusque belli imperium sibi postulare . <end>$$That the Bellovaci were the most powerful among them in valor , influence , and the number of men ; that these could muster 100 , 000 armed men , promised 60 , 000 picked men out of that number , and demanded for themselves the command of the whole war .
<start> Suessiones suos esse finitimos ; fines latissimos teracissimosque agros possidere Apud eos fuisse regem nostra etiam memoria Diviciacum , totius Galliae potentissimum , qui cum magnae partis harum regionum , tum etiam Britanniae imperium obtinuerit ; nunc esse regem Galbam : ad hunc propter iustitiam prudentiamque summam totius belli omnium voluntate deferri ; oppida habere numero XII , polliceri milia armata L ; totidem Nervios , qui maxime feri inter ipsos habeantur longissimeque absint ; XV milia Atrebates , Ambianos X milia , Morinos XXV milia , Menapios VII milia , Caletos X milia , Veliocasses et Viromanduos totidem , Atuatucos XVIIII milia ; Condrusos , Eburones , Caerosos , Paemanos , qui uno nomine Germani appellantur , arbitrari ad XL milia . <end>$$That the Suessiones were their nearest neighbors and possessed a very extensive and fertile country ; that among them , even in our own memory , Diviciacus , the most powerful man of all Gaul , had been king ; who had held the government of a great part of these regions , as well as of Britain ; that their king at present was Galba ; that the direction of the whole war was conferred by the consent of all , upon him , on account of his integrity and prudence ; that they had twelve towns ; that they had promised 50 , 000 armed men ; and that the Nervii , who are reckoned the most warlike among them , and are situated at a very great distance , as many ; the Atrebates 15 , 000 ; the Ambiani , 10 , 000 ; the Morini , 25 , 000 ; the Menapii , 9 , 000 ; the Caleti , 10 , 000 ; the Veliocasses and the Viromandui as many ; the Aduatuci 19 , 000 ; that the Condrusi , the Eburones , the Caeraesi , the Paemani , who are called by the common name of Germans , they thought , to the number of 40 , 000 .
<start> Caesar Remos cohortatus liberaliterque oratione prosecutus omnem senatum ad se convenire principumque liberos obsides ad se adduci iussit . <end>$$Caesar , having encouraged the Remi , and addressed them courteously , ordered the whole senate to assemble before him , and the children of their chief men to be brought to him as hostages ; all which commands they punctually performed by the day  .
<start> Quae omnia ab his diligenter ad diem facta sunt Ipse Diviciacum Haeduum magnopere cohortatus docet quanto opere rei publicae comnlunisque salutis intersit manus hostium distineri , ne cum tanta multitudine uno tempore confligendum sit . <end>$$He , addressing himself to Diviciacus , the Aeduan , with great earnestness , points out how much it concerns the republic and their common security , that the forces of the enemy should be divided , so that it might not be necessary to engage with so large a number at one time .
<start> Id fieri posse , si suas copias Haedui in fines Bellovacorum introduxerint et eorum agros populari coeperint . <end>$$that this might be affected if the Aedui would lead their forces into the territories of the Bellovaci , and begin to lay waste their country .
<start> His datis\rangle mandatis eum a se dimittit . <end>$$With these instructions he dismissed him from his presence .
<start> Postquam omnes Belgarum copias in unum locum coactas ad se venire vidit neque iam longe abesse ab iis quos miserat exploratoribus et ab Remis cognovit , flumen Axonam , quod est in extremis Remorum finibus , exercitum traducere maturavit atque ibi castra posuit . <end>$$After he perceived that all the forces of the Belgae , which had been collected in one place , were approaching toward him , and learned from the scouts whom he had sent out , and from the Remi , that they were then not far distant , he hastened to lead his army over the Aisne , which is on the borders of the Remi , and there pitched his camp .
<start> Quae res et latus ullum castrorum ripis fluminis muniebat et post eum quae erant tuta ab hostibus reddebat et commeatus ab Remis reliquisque civitatibus ut sine periculo ad eum portari possent efficiebat . <end>$$This position fortified one side of his camp by the banks of the river , rendered the country which lay in his rear secure from the enemy , and furthermore insured that provisions might without danger be brought to him by the Remi and the rest of the states .
<start> Ibi praesidium ponit et in altera parte fluminis QuintusTiturium Sabinum legatum cum sex cohortibus relinquit ; castra in altitudinem pedum XII vallo fossaque duodeviginti pedum muniri iubet . <end>$$He orders him to fortify a camp with a rampart twelve feet in height , and a trench eighteen feet in breadth .
<start> Ab his castris oppidum Remorum nomine Bibrax aberat milia passuum VIII . <end>$$There was a town of the Remi , by name Bibrax , eight miles distant from this camp .
<start> Id ex itinere magno impetu Belgae oppugnare coeperunt . <end>$$This the Belgae on their march began to attack with great vigor .
<start> Aegre eo die sustentatum est . <end>$$was with difficulty sustained for that day .
<start> Gallorum eadem atque Belgarum oppugnatio est haec : ubi circumiecta multitudine hominum totis moenibus undique in murum lapides iaci coepti sunt murusque defensoribus nudatus est , testudine facta portas succedunt murumque subruunt Quod tum facile fiebat . <end>$$The Gauls' mode of besieging is the same as that of the Belgae : when after having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the fortifications , stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all sides , and the wall has been stripped of its defenders , , forming a testudo , they advance to the gates and undermine the wall : which was easily effected on this occasion ; for while so large a number were casting stones and darts , no one was able to maintain his position upon the wall .
<start> Nam cum tanta multitudo lapides ac tela coicerent , in muro consistendi potestas erat nulli Cum finem oppugnandi nox fecisset , Iccius Remus , summa nobilitate et gratia inter suos , qui tum oppido praeerat , unus ex iis qui legati de pace ad Caesarem venerant , nuntium ad eum mittit , nisi subsidium sibi submittatur , sese diutius sustinere non posse . <end>$$When night had put an end to the assault , Iccius Remus , who was then in command of the town , one of the Remi , a man of the highest rank and influence among his people , and one of those who had come to Caesar as embassador for peace , sends messengers to him , That , unless assistance were sent to him he could not hold out any longer .
<start> Eo de media nocte Caesar isdem ducibus usus qui nuntii ab Iccio venerant , Numidas et Cretas sagittarios et funditores Baleares subsidio oppidanis mittit ; quorum adventu et Remis cum spe delensionis studium propugnandi accessit et hostibus eadem de causa spes potiundi oppidi discessit . <end>$$Thither , immediately after midnight , Caesar , using as guides the same persons who had come to him as messengers from Iccius , sends some Numidian and Cretan archers , and some Balearian slingers as a relief to the towns-people , by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with the hope of defense , was infused into the Remi , and , for the same reason , the hope of gaining the town , abandoned the enemy .
<start> Itaque paulisper apud oppidum morati agrosque Remorum depopulati , omnibus vicis aedificiisque quo adire potuerant incensis , ad castra Caesaris omnibus copiis contenderunt et a milibus passuum minus duobus castra posuerunt ; quae castra , ut fumo atque ignibus significabatur , amplius milibus passuum VIII latitudinem patebant . <end>$$Therefore , after staying a short time before the town , and laying waste the country of the Remi , when all the villages and buildings which they could approach had been burned , they hastened with all their forces to the camp of Caesar , and encamped within less than two miles ; and their camp , as was indicated by the smoke and fires , extended more than eight miles in breadth .
<start> Caesar primo et propter multitudinem hostium et propter eximiam opinionem virtutis proelio supersedere statuit ; cotidie tamen equestribus proeliis quid hostis virtute posset et quid nostri auderent periclitabatur . <end>$$Caesar at first determined to decline a battle , as well on account of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished reputation for valor : daily , however , in cavalry actions , he strove to ascertain by frequent trials , what the enemy could effect by their prowess and what our men would dare .
<start> Ubi nostros non esse inferiores intellexit , loco pro castris ad aciem instruendam natura oportuno atque idoneo , quod is collis ubi castra posita erant paululum ex planitie editus tantum adversus in latitudinem patebat quantum loci acies instructa occupare poterat , atque ex utraque parte lateris deiectus habebat et in fronte leniter fastigatus paulatim ad planitiem redibat , ab utroque latere eius collis transversam fossam obduxit circiter passuum CCCC et ad extremas fossas castella constituit ibique tormenta conlocavit , ne , cum aciem instruxisset , hostes , quod tantum multitudine poterant , ab lateribus pugnantes suos circumvenire possent . <end>$$When he perceived that our men were not inferior , as the place before the camp was naturally convenient and suitable for marshaling an army ; on either side of that hill he drew a cross trench of about four hundred paces , and at the extremities of that trench built forts , and placed there his military engines , lest , after he had marshaled his army , the enemy , since they were so powerful in point of number , should be able to surround his men in the flank , while fighting .
<start> Hoc facto , duabus legionibus quas proxime conscripserat in castris relictis ut , si quo opus esset , subsidio duci possent , reliquas VI legiones pro castris in acie constituit . <end>$$After doing this , and leaving in the camp the two legions which he had last raised , that , if there should be any occasion , they might be brought as a reserve , he formed the other six legions in order of battle before the camp .
<start> Hostes item suas copias ex castris eductas instruxerunt . <end>$$The enemy , likewise , had drawn up their forces which they had brought out of the camp .
<start> Palus erat non magna inter nostrum atque hostium exercitum . <end>$$There was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that of the enemy .
<start> Hanc si nostri transirent hostes expectabant ; nostri autem , si ab illis initium transeundi fieret , ut impeditos adgrederentur parati in armis erant . <end>$$The latter were waiting to see if our men would pass this ; our men , also , were ready in arms to attack them while disordered , if the first attempt to pass should be made by them .
<start> Interim proelio equestri inter duas acies contendebatur . <end>$$In the mean time battle was commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action .
<start> Ubi neutri transeundi initium faciunt , secundiore equitum proelio nostris Caesar suos in castra reduxit . <end>$$When neither army began to pass the marsh , Caesar , upon the skirmishes of the horse favorable to our men , led back his forces into the camp .
<start> Hostes protinus ex eo loco ad flumen Axonam contenderunt , quod esse post nostra castra demonstratum est . <end>$$The enemy immediately hastened from that place to the river Aisne , which it has been stated , was behind our camp .
<start> Ibi vadis repertis partem suarum copiarum traducere conati sunt eo consilio ut , si possent , castellum , cui praeerat QuintusTiturius legatus , expugnarent pontemque interscinderent , si minus potuissent , agros Remorum popularentur , qui magno nobis usui ad bellum gerendum erant , commeatuque nostros prohiberent . <end>$$Finding a ford there , they endeavored to lead a part of their forces over it ; with the design , that , if they could , they might carry by storm the fort which Quintus Titurius , Caesar's legate , commanded , and might cut off the bridge ; but , if they could not do that , they should lay waste the lands of the Remi , which were of great use to us in carrying on the war , and might hinder our men from foraging .
<start> certior factus ab Titurio onlnem equitatum et levis armaturae Numidas , funditores sagittariosque pontem traducit atque ad eos contendit . <end>$$Caesar , being apprized of this by Titurius , leads all his cavalry and light-armed Numidians , slingers and archers , over the bridge , and hastens toward them .
<start> Acriter in eo loco pugnatum est . <end>$$There was a severe struggle in that place .
<start> Hostes impeditos nostri in flumine adgressi magnum eorum numerum occiderunt ; per eorum corpora reliquos audacissime transire conantes multitudine telorum reppulerunt primosque , qui transierant , equitatu circumventos interfecerunt . <end>$$Our men , attacking in the river the disordered enemy , slew a great part of them By the immense number of their missiles they drove back the rest , who , in a most courageous manner were attempting to pass over their bodies , and surrounded with their cavalry , and cut to pieces those who had first crossed the river .
<start> Hostes , ubi et de expugnando oppido et de flumine transeundo spem se fefellisse intellexerunt neque nostros in locum iniquiorum progredi pugnandi causa viderunt atque ipsos res frumentaria deficere coepit , concilio convocato constituerunt optimum esse domum suam quemque reverti , et quorum in fines primum Romani exercitum introduxissent , ad eos defendendos undique convenirent , ut potius in suis quam in alienis finibus decertarent et domesticis copiis rei frumentariae uterentur . <end>$$The enemy , when they perceived that their hopes had deceived them both with regard to their taking the town by storm and also their passing the river , and did not see our men advance to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting , and when provisions began to fail them , having called a council , determined that it was best for each to return to his country , and resolved to assemble from all quarters to defend those into whose territories the Romans should first march an army ; that they might contend in their own rather than in a foreign country , and might enjoy the stores of provision which they possessed at home .
<start> Ad eam sententiam cum reliquis causis haec quoque ratio eos deduxit , quod Diviciacum atque Haeduos finibus Bellovacorum adpropinquare cognoverant . <end>$$Together with other causes , this consideration also led them to that resolution , viz : that they had learned that Diviciacus and the Aedui were approaching the territories of the Bellovaci .
<start> His persuaderi ut diutius morarentur neque suis auxilium terrent non poterat . <end>$$And it was impossible to persuade the latter to stay any longer , or to deter them from conveying succor to their own people .
<start> Ea re constituta , secunda vigilia magno cum , strepitu ac tumultu castris egressi nullo certo ordine neque imperio , cum sibi quisque primum itineris locum peteret et domum pervenire properaret , fecerunt ut consimilis fugae profectio videretur . <end>$$That matter being determined on , marching out of their camp at the second watch , with great noise and confusion , in no fixed order , nor under any command , since each sought for himself the foremost place in the journey , and hastened to reach home , they made their departure appear very like a flight .
<start> Hac re statim Caesar per speculatores cognita insidias veritus , quod qua de causa discederent nondum perspexerat , exercitum equitatumque castris continuit . <end>$$Caesar , immediately learning this through his scouts , fearing an ambuscade , because he had not yet discovered for what reason they were departing , kept his army and cavalry within the camp .
<start> His QuintusPedium et LuciusAurunculeium Cottam legatos praefecit ; TitusLabienum legatum cum legionibus tribus subsequi iussit . <end>$$He ordered Titus Labienus , another of his legates , to follow them closely with three legions .
<start> Hi novissimos adorti et multa milia passuum prosecuti magnam multitudinem eorum fugientium conciderunt , cum ab extremo agmine , ad quos ventum erat , consisterent fortiterque impetum nostrorum militum sustinerent , priores , quod abesse a periculo viderentur neque ulla necessitate neque imperio continerentur , exaudito clamore perturbatis ordinibus omnes in fuga sibi praesidium ponerent . <end>$$These , attacking their rear , and pursuing them for many miles , slew a great number of them as they were fleeing ; while those in the rear with whom they had come up , halted , and bravely sustained the attack of our soldiers ; the van , because they appeared to be removed from danger , and were not restrained by any necessity or command , as soon as the noise was heard , broke their ranks , and , to a man , rested their safety in flight .
<start> Ita sine ullo periculo tantam eorum multitudinem nostri interfecerunt quantum fuit diei spatium ; sub occasum solis sequi destiterunt seque in castra , ut erat imperatum , receperunt . <end>$$Thus without any risk our men killed as great a number of them as the length of the day allowed ; and at sunset desisted from the pursuit , and betook themselves into the camp , as they had been commanded .
<start> Postridie eius diei Caesar , prius quam se hostes ex terrore ac fuga reciperent , in fines Suessionum , qui proximi Remis erant , exercitum duxit et magno itinere ad oppidum Noviodunum contendit . <end>$$On the day following , before the enemy could recover from their terror and flight , Caesar led his army into the territories of the Suessiones , which are next to the Remi , and having accomplished a long march , hastens to the town named Noviodunum .
<start> Id ex itinere oppugnare conatus , quod vacuum ab defensoribus esse audiebat , propter latitudinem fossae murique altitudinem paucis defendentihus expugnare non potuit . <end>$$Having attempted to take it by storm on his march , because he heard that it was destitute of defenders , he was not able to carry it by assault , on account of the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall , though few were defending it .
<start> Castris munitis vineas agere quaeque ad oppugnandum usui erant comparare coepit . <end>$$Therefore , having fortified the camp , he began to bring up the vineae , and to provide whatever things were necessary for the storm .
<start> Interim omnis ex fuga Suessionum multitudo in oppidum proxima nocte convenit . <end>$$In the mean time the whole body of the Suessiones , after their flight , came the next night into the town .
<start> Celeriter vineis ad oppidum actis , aggere iacto turribusque constitutis , magnitudine operum , quae neque viderant ante Galli neque audierant , et celeritate Romanorum permoti legatos ad Caesarem de deditione mittunt et petentibus Remis ut conservarentur impetrant . <end>$$The vineae having been quickly brought up against the town , a mound thrown up , and towers built , the Gauls , amazed by the greatness of the works , such as they had neither seen nor heard of before , and struck also by the dispatch of the Romans , send embassadors to Caesar respecting a surrender , and succeed in consequence of the Remi requesting that they might be spared .
<start> Caesar , obsidibus acceptis primis civitatis atque ipsius Galbae regis duobus filiis armisque omnibus ex oppido traditis , in deditionem Suessiones accipit exercitumque in Bellovacos ducit . <end>$$Caesar , having received as hostages the first men of the state , and even the two sons of king Galba himself ; and all the arms in the town having been delivered up , admitted the Suessiones to a surrender , and led his army against the Bellovaci .
<start> Qui cum se suaque omnia in oppidum Bratuspantium contulissent atque ab eo oppido Caesar cum exercitu circiter milia passuum V abesset , omnes maiores natu ex oppido egressi manus ad Caesarem tendere et voce significare coeperunt sese in eius fidem ac potestatem venire neque contra populum Romanum armis contendere . <end>$$Who , when they had conveyed themselves and all their possessions into the town called Bratuspantium , and Caesar with his army was about five miles distant from that town , all the old men , going out of the town , began to stretch out their hands to Caesar , and to intimate by their voice that they would throw themselves on his protection and power , nor would contend in arms against the Roman people .
<start> Item , cum ad oppidum accessisset castraque ibi poneret , pueri mulieresque ex muro passis mallibus suo more pacem ab Romanis petierunt . <end>$$In like manner , when he had come up to the town , and there pitched his camp , the boys and the women from the wall , with outstretched hands , after their custom , begged peace from the Romans .
<start> Petere non solum Bellovacos , sed etiam pro his Haeduos , ut sua clementia ac mansuetudine in eos utatur . <end>$$That they who had been the leaders of that plot , because they perceived how great a calamity they had brought upon the state , had fled into Britain .
<start> Quod si fecerit , Haeduorum auctoritatem apud omnes Belgas amplificaturum , quorum auxiliis atque opibus , si qua bella inciderint , sustentare consuerint . <end>$$That not only the Bellovaci , but also the Aedui , entreated him to use his clemency and lenity toward them : which if he did , he would increase the influence of the Aedui among all the Belgae , by whose succor and resources they had been accustomed to support themselves whenever any wars occurred .
<start> Caesar honoris Diviciaci atque Haeduorum causa sese eos in fidem recepturum et conservaturum dixit , et quod erat civitas magna inter Belgas auctoritate atque hominum multitudine praestabat , DC obsides poposcit . <end>$$Caesar said that on account of his respect for Diviciacus and the Aeduans , he would receive them into his protection , and would spare them ; but , because the state was of great influence among the Belgae , and pre-eminent in the number of its population , he demanded 600 hostages .
<start> His traditis omnibusque armis ex oppido conlatis , ab eo loco in fines Ambianorum pervenit ; qui se suaque omnia sine mora dediderunt . <end>$$When these were delivered , and all the arms in the town collected , he went from that place into the territories of the Ambiani , who , without delay , surrendered themselves and all their possessions .
<start> Eorum fines Nervii attingebant Quorum de natura moribusque Caesar cum quaereret , sic reperiebat : nullum esse aditum ad eos mercatoribus ; nihil pati vini reliquarumque rerum ad luxuriam pertinentium inferri , quod his rebus relanguescere animos eorum et remitti virtutem existimarent ; esse homines feros magnaeque virtutis ; increpitare atque incusare reliquos Belgas , qui se populo Romano dedidissent patriamque virtutem proiecissent ; confirmare sese neque legatos missuros neque ullam condicionem pacis accepturos . <end>$$Upon their territories bordered the Nervii , concerning whose character and customs when Caesar inquired he received the following information : —That there was no access for merchants to them ; that they suffered no wine and other things tending to luxury to be imported ; because , they thought that by their use the mind is enervated and the courage impaired : that they were a savage people and of great bravery : that they upbraided and condemned the rest of the Belgae who had surrendered themselves to the Roman people and thrown aside their national courage : that they openly declared they would neither send embassadors , nor accept any condition of peace .
<start> Cum per eorum fines triduum iter fecisset , inveniebat ex captivis Sabim flumen a castris suis non amplius milibus passuum X abesse ; trans id flumen omnes Nervios consedisse adventumque ibi Romanorum expectare una cum Atrebatibus et Viromanduis , finitimis suis (nam his utrisque persuaserant uti eandem belli fortunam experirentur) ; expectari etiam ab iis Atuatucorum copias atque esse in itinere ; mulieres quique per aetatem ad pugnam inutiles viderentur in eum locum coniecisse quo propter paludes exercitui aditus non esset . <end>$$After he had made three days march through their territories , he discovered from some prisoners , that the river Sambre was not more than ten miles from his camp ; that all the Nervii had stationed themselves on the other side of that river , and together with the Atrebates and the Viromandui , their neighbors , were there awaiting the arrival of the Romans ; for they had persuaded both these nations to try the same fortune of war : that the forces of the Aduatuci were also expected by them , and were on their march ; that they had put their women , and those who through age appeared useless for war , in a place to which there was no approach for an army , on account of the marshes .
<start> His rebus cognitis , exploratores centurionesque praemittit qui locum castris idoneum deligant . <end>$$Having learned these things , he sends forward scouts and centurions to choose a convenient place for the camp .
<start> Cum ex dediticiis Belgis reliquisque Gallis complures Caesarem secuti una iter facerent , quidam ex his , ut postea ex captivis cognitum est , eorum dierum consuetudine itineris nostri exercitus perspecta , nocte ad Nervios pervenerunt atque his demonstrarunt inter singulas legiones impedimentorum magnum numerum intercedere , neque esse quicquam negotii , cum prima legio in castra venisset reliquaeque legiones magnum spatium abessent , hanc sub sarcinis adoriri ; qua pulsa impedimentisque direptis , futurum ut reliquae contra consistere non auderent . <end>$$And as a great many of the surrounding Belgae and other Gauls , following Caesar , marched with him ; some of these , as was afterwards learned from the prisoners , having accurately observed , during those days , the army's method of marching , went by night to the Nervii , and informed them that a great number of baggage-trains passed between the several legions , and that there would be no difficulty , when the first legion had come into the camp , and the other legions were at a great distance , to attack that legion while under baggage , which being routed , and the baggage-train seized , it would come to pass that the other legions would not dare to stand their ground .
<start> Adiuvabat etiam eorum collsilium qui rem deferebant quod Nervii antiquitus , cum equitatu nihil possent (neque enim ad hoc tempus ei rei student , sed quicquid possunt , pedestribus valent copiis) , quo facilius finitimorum equitatum , si praedandi causa ad eos venissent , impedirent , teneris arboribus incisis atque inflexis crebrisque in latitudinem ramis enatis rubis sentibusque interiectis effecerant ut instar muri hae saepes munimentum praeberent , quo non modo non intrari sed ne perspici quidem posset . <end>$$It added weight also to the advice of those who reported that circumstance , that the Nervii , from early times , because they were weak in cavalry , , in order that they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their neighbors if they came upon them for the purpose of plundering , having cut young trees , and bent them , by means of their numerous branches on to the sides , and the quick-briars and thorns springing up between them , had made these hedges present a fortification like a wall , through which it was not only impossible to enter , but even to penetrate with the eye .
<start> His rebus cum iter agminis nostri impediretur , non omittendum sibi consilium Nervii existimaverunt . <end>$$Since the march of our army would be obstructed by these things , the Nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected by them .
<start> Loci natura erat haec , quem locum nostri castris delegerant Collis ab summo aequaliter declivis ad flumen Sabim , quod supra nominavimus , vergebat Ab eo flumine pari acclivitate collis nascebatur adversus huic et contrarius , passus circiter CC infimus apertus , ab superiore parte silvestris , ut non facile introrsus perspici posset . <end>$$The nature of the ground which our men had chosen for the camp was this : A hill , declining evenly from the top , extending to the river Sambre , which we have mentioned above : from this river there arose a hill of like ascent , on the other side and opposite to the former , and open for about 200 paces at the lower part ; but in the upper part , woody , that it was not easy to see through it into the interior .
<start> Intra eas silvas hostes in occulto sese continebant ; in aperto loco secundum flumen paucae stationes equitum videbantur . <end>$$Within these woods the enemy kept themselves in concealment ; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground , along the river .
<start> Fluminis erat altitudo pedum circiter trium . <end>$$The depth of the river was about three feet .
<start> Caesar equitatu praemisso subsequebatur omnibus copiis ; sed ratio ordoque agminis aliter se habebat ac Belgae ad Nervios detulerant . <end>$$Caesar , having sent his cavalry on before , followed close after them with all his forces ; but the plan and order of the march was different from that which the Belgae had reported to the Nervii .
<start> Caesari omnia uno tempore erant agenda : vexillum proponendum , quod erat insigne , cum ad arma concurri oporteret ; signum tuba dandum ; ab opere revocandi milites ; qui paulo longius aggeris petendi causa processerant arcessendi ; acies instruenda ; milites cohortandi ; signum dandum . <end>$$Caesar had every thing to do at one time : the standard to be displayed , which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms ; the signal to be given by the trumpet ; the soldiers to be called off from the works ; those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of seeking materials for the rampart , to be summoned ; the order of battle to be formed ; the soldiers to be encouraged ; the watchword to be given .
<start> Quarum rerum magnam partem temporis brevitas et incursus hostium impediebat . <end>$$A great part of these arrangements was prevented by the shortness of time and the sudden approach and charge of the enemy .
<start> His difficultatibus duae res erant subsidio , scientia atque usus militum , quod superioribus proeliis exercitati quid fieri oporteret non minus commode ipsi sibi praescribere quam ab aliis doceri poterant , et quod ab opere singulisque legionibus singulos legatos Caesar discedere nisi munitis castris vetuerat . <end>$$Under these difficulties two things proved of advantage ; the skill and experience of the soldiers , because , having been trained by former engagements , they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done , as conveniently as receive information from others ; and that Caesar had forbidden his several legates to depart from the works and their respective legions , before the camp was fortified .
<start> Hi propter propinquitatem et celeritatem hostium nihil iam Caesaris imperium expectabant , sed per se quae videbantur administrabant . <end>$$These , on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy , did not then wait for any command from Caesar , but of themselves executed whatever appeared proper .
<start> Caesar , necessariis rebus imperatis , ad cohortandos milites , quam partem fors obtulit , decucurrit et ad legionem decimam devenit . <end>$$Caesar , having given the necessary orders , hastened to and fro into whatever quarter fortune carried him , to animate the troops , and came to the tenth legion .
<start> Milites non longiore oratione cohortatus quam uti suae pristinae virtutis memoriam retinerent neu perturbarentur animo hostiumque impetum fortiter sustinerent , quod non longius hostes aberant quam quo telum adigi posset , proelii committendi signum dedit . <end>$$Having encouraged the soldiers with no further speech than that they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted valor , and not be confused in mind , but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy ; as the latter were not further from them than the distance to which a dart could be cast , he gave the signal for commencing battle .
<start> Atque in alteram item cohortandi causa profectus pugnantibus occurrit . <end>$$And having gone to another quarter for the purpose of encouraging , he finds them fighting .
<start> Temporis tanta fuit exiguitas hostiumque tam paratus ad dimicandum animus ut non modo ad insignia accommodanda sed etiam ad galeas induendas scutisque tegimenta detrahenda tempus defuerit . <end>$$Such was the shortness of the time , and so determined was the mind of the enemy on fighting , that time was wanting not only for affixing the military insignia , but even for putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers from the shields .
<start> Quam quisque ab opere in partem casu devenit quaeque prima signa conspexit , ad haec constitit , ne in quaerendis suis pugnandi tempus dimitteret . <end>$$To whatever part any one by chance came from the works , and whatever standards he saw first , at these he stood , lest in seeking his own company he should lose the time for fighting .
<start> Instructo exercitu magis ut loci natura et necessitas temporis quam ut rei militaris ratio atque ordo postulabat , cum diversae legiones aliae alia in parte hostibus resisterent saepibusque densissimis , ut ante demonstravimus , interiectis prospectus impediretur , neque certa subsidia conlocari neque quid in quaque parte opus esset provideri neque ab uno omnia imperia administrari poterant . <end>$$The army having been marshaled , rather as the nature of the ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time , than as the method and order of military matters required ; while the legions in the different places were withstanding the enemy , some in one quarter , some in another , and the view was obstructed by the very thick hedges intervening , as we have before remarked , neither could proper reserves be posted , nor could the necessary measures be taken in each part , nor could all the commands be issued by one person .
<start> Itaque in tanta rerum iniquitate fortunae quoque eventus varii sequebantur . <end>$$Therefore , in such an unfavorable state of affairs , various events of fortune followed .
<start> Legionis VIIII et X milites , ut in sinistra parte aciei constiterant , pilis emissis cursu ac lassitudine exanimatos vulneribusque confectos Atrebates celeriter ex loco superiore in flumen compulerunt et transire conantes insecuti gladiis magnam partem eorum impeditam interfecerunt . <end>$$The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions , as they had been stationed on the left part of the army , casting their weapons , speedily drove the Atrebates who were breathless with running and fatigue , and worn out with wounds , from the higher ground into the river ; and following them as they were endeavoring to pass it , slew with their swords a great part of them while impeded  .
<start> Ipsi transire flumen non dubitaverunt et in locum iniquum progressi rursus resistentes hostes redintegrato proelio in fugam coniecerunt . <end>$$They themselves did not hesitate to pass the river ; and having advanced to a disadvantageous place , when the battle was renewed , they again put to flight the enemy , who had returned and were opposing them .
<start> Item alia in parte diversae duae legiones , XI et VIII , profligatis Viromanduis , quibuscum erant congressae , ex loco superiore in ipsis fluminis ripis proeliabantur . <end>$$In like manner , in another quarter two different legions , the eleventh and the eighth , having routed the Viromandui , with whom they had engaged , were fighting from the higher ground upon the very banks of the river .
<start> At totis fere castris a fronte et a sinistra parte nudatis , cum in dextro cornu legio XII et non magno ab ea intervallo VII constitisset , omnes Nervii confertissimo agmine duce Boduognato , qui summam imperii tenebat , ad eum locum contenderunt ; quorum pars ab aperto latere legiones circumvenire , pars summum castrorum locum petere coepit . <end>$$But , almost the whole camp on the front and on the left side being then exposed , since the twelfth legion was posted in the right wing , and the seventh at no great distance from it , all the Nervii , in a very close body , with Boduognatus , who held the chief command , as their leader , hastened toward that place ; and part of them began to surround the legions on their unprotected flank , part to make for the highest point of the encampment .
<start> Eodem tempore equites nostri levisque armaturae pedites , qui cum iis una fuerant , quos primo hostium impetu pulsos dixeram , cum se in castra reciperent , adversis hostibus occurrebant ac rursus aliam in partem fugam petebant ; et calones , qui ab decumana porta ac summo iugo collis nostros victores flumen transire conspexerant , praedandi causa egressi , cum respexissent et hostes in nostris castris versari vidissent , praecipites fugae sese mandabant . <end>$$At the same time our horsemen , and light-armed infantry , who had been with those , who , as I have related , were routed by the first assault of the enemy , as they were betaking themselves into the camp , met the enemy face to face , and again sought flight into another quarter ; and the camp-followers who from the Decuman Gate , and from the highest ridge of the hill had seen our men pass the river as victors , when , after going out for the purposes of plundering , they looked back and saw the enemy parading in our camp , committed themselves precipitately to flight ; at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came with the baggage-train : and they , were carried some one way , some another .
<start> Simul eorum qui cum impedimentis veniebant clamor fremitusque oriebatur , aliique aliam in partem perterriti ferebantur Quibus omnibus rebus permoti equites Treveri , quorum inter Gallos virtutis opinio est singularis , qui auxilii causa a civitate missi ad Caesarem venerant , cum multitudine hostium castra compleri , legiones premi et paene circumventas teneri , calones , equites , tunditores , Numidas diversos dissipatosque in omnes partes fugere vidissent , desperatis nostris rebus domum contenderunt : Romanos pulsos superatosque , castris impedimentisque eorum hostes potitos civitati renuntiaverunt . <end>$$By all these circumstances the cavalry of the Treviri were much alarmed , , and , when they saw our camp filled with a large number of the enemy , the legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded , the camp-retainers , horsemen , slingers , and Numidians fleeing on all sides divided and scattered , they , despairing of our affairs , hastened home , and related to their state that the Romans were routed and conquered , that the enemy were in possession of their camp and baggage-train .
<start> Caesar ab X legionis cohortatione ad dextrum cornu prolectus , ubi suos urgeri signisque in unum locum conlatis XII legionis confertos milites sibi ipsos ad pugnam esse impedimento vidit , quartae cohortis omnibus centurionibus occisis signiferoque interfecto , signo amisso , reliquarum cohortium omnibus fere centurionibus aut vulneratis aut occisis , in his primipilo Publius Sextio Baculo , fortissimo viro , multis gravibusque vulneribus confecto , ut iam se sustinere non posset , reliquos esse tardiores et non nullos ab novissimis deserto loco proelio excedere ac tela vitare , hostes neque a fronte ex inferiore loco subeuntes intermittere et ab utroque latere instare et rem esse in angusto vidit , neque ullum esse subsidium quod submitti posset , scuto ab novissimis militi detracto , quod ipse eo sine scuto venerat , in primam aciem processit centurionibusque nominatim appellatis reliquos cohortatus milites signa inferre et manipulos laxare iussit , quo facilius gladiis uti possent . <end>$$Caesar proceeded , after encouraging the tenth legion , to the right wing ; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed , and that in consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected together in one place , the crowded soldiers were a hinderance to themselves in the fight ; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain , and the standard-bearer killed , the standard itself lost , almost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain , and among them the chief centurion of the legion Publius Sextius Baculus , a very valiant man , who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds , that he was already unable to support himself ; he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts , and that some , deserted by those in the rear , were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons ; that the enemy though advancing from the lower ground , were not relaxing in front , and were pressing hard on both flanks ; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis , and that there was not any reserve which could be brought up , having therefore snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear , he advanced to the front of the line , and addressing the centurions by name , and encouraging the rest of the soldiers , he ordered them to carry forward the standards , and extend the companies , that they might the more easily use their swords .
<start> Cuius adventu spe inlata militibus ac redintegrato animo , cum pro se quisque in conspectu imperatoris etiam in extremis suis rebus operam navare cuperet , paulum hostium impetus tardatus est . <end>$$On his arrival , as hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored , while every one for his own part , in the sight of his general , desired to exert his utmost energy , the impetuosity of the enemy was a little checked .
<start> Caesar , cum VII legionem , quae iuxta constiterat , item urgeri ab hoste vidisset , tribunos militum monuit ut paulatim sese legiones coniungerent et conversa signa in hostes inferrent Quo facto cum aliis alii subsidium ferrent neque timerent ne aversi ab hoste circumvenirentur , audacius resistere ac fortius pugnare coeperunt . <end>$$Caesar , when he perceived that the seventh legion , which stood close by him , was also hard pressed by the enemy , directed the tribunes of the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually , and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front ; which having been done , since they brought assistance the one to the other , nor feared lest their rear should be surrounded by the enemy , they began to stand their ground more boldly , and to fight more courageously .
<start> Interim milites legionum duarum quae in novissimo agmine praesidio impedimentis fuerant , proelio nuntiato , cursu incitato in summo colle ab hostibus conspiciebantur , et TitusLabienus castris hostium potitus et ex loco superiore quae res in nostris castris gererentur conspicatus Xlegionem subsidio nostris misit Qui cum ex equitum et calonum fuga quo in loco res esset quantoque in periculo et castra et legiones et imperator versaretur cognovissent , nihil ad celeritatem sibi reliqui fecerunt . <end>$$In the mean time , the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army , as a guard for the baggage-train , upon the battle being reported to them , quickened their pace , and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill ; and Titus Labienus , having gained possession of the camp of the enemy , and observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp , sent the tenth legion as a relief to our men , who , when they had learned from the flight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was , and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were involved , left undone nothing to dispatch .
<start> Horum adventu tanta rerum commutatio est facta ut nostri , etiam qui vulneribus confecti procubuissent , scutis innixi proelium redintegrarent , calones perterritos hostes conspicati etiam inermes armatis occurrerent , equites vero , ut turpitudinem fugae virtute delerent , omnibus in locis pugnae se legionariis militibus praeferrent . <end>$$By their arrival , so great a change of matters was made , that our men , even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds , leaned on their shields , and renewed the fight : then the camp-retainers , though unarmed , seeing the enemy completely dismayed , attacked armed ; the horsemen too , that they might by their valor blot the disgrace of their flight , thrust themselves before the legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle .
<start> At hostes , etiam in extrema spe salutis , tantam virtutem praestiterunt ut , cum primi eorum cecidissent , proximi iacentibus insisterent atque ex eorum corporibus pugnarent , his deiectis et coacervatis cadaveribus qui superessent ut ex tumulo tela in nostros coicerent et pila intercepta remitterent : ut non nequiquam tantae virtutis homines iudicari deberet ausos esse transire latissimum flumen , ascendere altissimas ripas , subire iniquissimum locum ; quae facilia ex difficillimis animi magnitudo redegerat . <end>$$But the enemy , even in the last hope of safety , displayed such great courage , that when the foremost of them had fallen , the next stood upon them prostrate , and fought from their bodies ; when these were overthrown , and their corpses heaped up together , those who survived cast their weapons against our men , as from a mound , and returned our darts which had fallen short between ; so that it ought not to be concluded , that men of such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very broad river , ascend very high banks , and come up to a very disadvantageous place ; since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy , although in themselves very difficult .
<start> Atuatuci , de quibus supra diximus , cum omnibus copiis auxilio Nerviis venirent , hac pugna nuntiata ex itinere domum reverterunt ; cunctis oppidis castellisque desertis sua omnia in unum oppidum egregie natura munitum contulerunt . <end>$$When the Aduatuci , of whom we have written above , were coming up with all their forces to the assistance of the Nervii , upon this battle being reported to them , they returned home after they were on the march ; deserting all their towns and forts , they conveyed together all their possessions into one town , eminently fortified by nature .
<start> Quod cum ex omnibus in circuitu partibus altissimas rupes deiectusque haberet , una ex parte leniter acclivis aditus in latitudinem non amplius pedum CC relinquebatur ; quem locum duplici altissimo muro munierant ; tum magni ponderis saxa et praeacutas trabes in muro conlocabant . <end>$$While this town had on all sides around it very high rocks and precipices , there was left on one side a gently ascending approach , of not more than 200 feet in width ; which place they had fortified with a very lofty double wall : besides , they had placed stones of great weight and sharpened stakes upon the walls .
<start> Ipsi erant ex Cimbris Teutonisque prognati , qui , cum iter in provinciam nostram atque Italiam ; facerent , iis impedimentis quae secum agere ac portare non poterant citra flumen Rhenum depositis custodiae ac praesidio VI milia hominum una reliquerant . <end>$$They were descended from the Cimbri and Teutones , who , when they were marching into our province and Italy , having deposited on this side the river Rhine such of their baggage-trains as they could not drive or convey with them , left 6 , 000 of their men as a guard and defense for them .
<start> Hi post eorum obitum multos annos a finitimis exagitati , cum alias bellum inferrent , alias inlatum defenderent , consensu eorum omnium pace facta hunc sibi domicilio locum delegerant . <end>$$These having , after the destruction of their countrymen , been harassed for many years by their neighbors , while one time they waged war offensively , and at another resisted it when waged against them , concluded a peace with the consent of all , and chose this place as their settlement .
<start> Ac primo adventu exercitus nostri crebras ex oppido excursiones faciebant parvulisque proeliis cum nostris contendebant ; postea vallo pedum XII in circuitu milium crebrisque castellis circummuniti oppido sese continebant . <end>$$And on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies from the town , and contended with our men in trifling skirmishes ; afterward , when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet , and fifteen miles in circuit , they kept themselves within the town .
<start> Ubi vero moveri et adpropinquare muris viderunt , nova atque inusitata specie commoti legatos ad Caesarem de pace miserunt , qui ad hunc modum locuti , non se existimare Romanos sine ope divina bellum gerere , qui tantae altitudinis machinationes tanta celeritate promovere possent , se suaque omnia eorum potestati permittere dixerunt . <end>$$But when they saw that it was being moved , and was approaching their walls , startled by the new and unaccustomed sight , they sent embassadors to Caesar about peace ; who spoke in the following manner : That they did not believe the Romans waged war without divine aid , since they were able to move forward machines of such a height with so great speed , and thus fight from close quarters ; that they resigned themselves and all their possessions to disposal : that they begged and earnestly entreated one thing , viz .
<start> Ad haec Caesar respondit : se magis consuetudine sua quam merito eorum civitatem conservaturum , si prius quam murum aries attigisset se dedidissent ; sed deditionis nullam esse condicionem nisi armis traditis Se id quod in Nerviis fecisset facturum finitimisque imperaturum ne quam dediticiis populi Romani iniuriam inferrent . <end>$$To these things Caesar replied , That he , in accordance with his custom , rather than owing to their desert , should spare the state , if they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch the wall ; but that there was no condition of surrender , except upon their arms being delivered up ; that he should do to them that which he had done in the case of the Nervii , and would command their neighbors not to offer any injury to those who had surrendered to the Roman people .
<start> Re renuntiata ad suos illi se quae imperarentur facere dixerunt . <end>$$The matter being reported to their countrymen , they said that they would execute his commands .
<start> Armorum magna multitudine de muro in fossam , quae erat ante oppidum , iacta , sic ut prope summam muri aggerisque altitudinem acervi armorum adaequarent , et tamen circiter parte tertia , ut postea perspectum est , celata atque in oppido retenta , portis patefactis eo die pace sunt usi . <end>$$Having cast a very large quantity of their arms from the wall into the trench that was before the town , so that the heaps of arms almost equalled the top of the wall and the rampart , and nevertheless having retained and concealed , as we afterward discovered , about a third part in the town , the gates were opened , and they enjoyed peace for that day .
<start> Sub vesperum Caesar portas claudi militesque ex oppido exire iussit , ne quam noctu oppidani a militibus iniuriam acciperent . <end>$$Toward evening Caesar ordered the gates to be shut , and the soldiers to go out of the town , lest the towns-people should receive any injury from them by night .
<start> Illi ante inito , ut intellectum est , consilio , quod deditione facta nostros praesidia deducturos aut denique indiligentius servaturos crediderant , partim cum iis quae retinuerant et celaverant armis , partim scutis ex cortice factis aut viminibus intextis , quae subito , ut temporis exiguitas postulabat , pellibus induxerant , tertia vigilia , qua minime arduus ad nostras munitiones accensus videbatur , omnibus copiis repente ex oppido eruptionem fecerunt . <end>$$They , by a design before entered into , as we afterwards understood , because they believed that , as a surrender had been made , our men would dismiss their guards , or at least would keep watch less carefully , partly with those arms which they had retained and concealed , partly with shields made of bark or interwoven wickers , which they had hastily covered over with skins , in the third watch , suddenly made a sally from the town with all their forces in which the ascent to our fortifications seemed the least difficult .
<start> Celeriter , ut ante Caesar imperaverat , ignibus significatione facta , ex proximis castellis eo concursum est , pugnatumque ab hostibus ita acriter est ut a viris fortibus in extrema spe salutis iniquo loco contra eos qui ex vallo turribusque tela iacerent pugnari debuit , cum in una virtute omnis spes consisteret . <end>$$The signal having been immediately given by fires , as Caesar had previously commended , a rush was made thither from the nearest fort ; and the battle was fought by the enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fought by brave men , in the last hope of safety , in a disadvantageous place , and against those who were throwing their weapons from a rampart and from towers ; since all hope of safety depended on their courage alone .
<start> Occisis ad hominum milibus IIII reliqui in oppidum reiecti sunt . <end>$$About 4 , 000 of the men having been slain , the rest were forced back into the town .
<start> Postridie eius diei refractis portis , cum iam defenderet nemo , atque intromissis militibus nostris , sectionem eius oppidi universa Caesar vendidit . <end>$$The day after , Caesar , after breaking open the gates , which there was no one then to defend , and sending in our soldiers , sold the whole spoil of that town .
<start> Ab iis qui emerant capitum numerus ad eum relatus est milium LIII . <end>$$The number of 53 , 000 persons was reported to him by those who had bought them .
<start> Eodem tempore a Publius Crasso , quem cum legione una miserat ad Venetos , Venellos , Osismos , Coriosolitas , Esuvios , Aulercos , Redones , quae sunt maritimae civitates Oceanumque attingunt , certior factus est omnes eas civitates in dicionem potestatemque populi Romani esse redactas . <end>$$At the same time he was informed by Publius Crassus , whom he had sent with one legion against the Veneti , the Venelli , the Osismi , the Coriosolitae , the Esuvii , the Aulerci , and the Redones , which are maritime states , and touch upon the ocean , that all these nations were brought under the dominion and power of the Roman people .
<start> His rebus gestis omni Gallia pacata , tanta huius belli ad barbaros opinio perlata est uti ab iis nationibus quae trans Rhenum incolerent legationes ad Caesarem mitterentur , quae se obsides daturas , imperata facturas pollicerentur . <end>$$These things being achieved , all Gaul being subdued , so high an opinion of this war was spread among the barbarians , that embassadors were sent to Caesar by those nations who dwelt beyond the Rhine , to promise that they would give hostages and execute his commands .
<start> Quas legationes Caesar , quod in Italiam Illyricumque properabat , inita proxima aestate ad se reverti iussit . <end>$$Which embassies Caesar , because he was hastening into Italy and Illyricum , ordered to return to him at the beginning of the following summer .
<start> Ipse in Carnutes , Andes , Turonos quaeque civitates propinquae iis locis erant ubi bellum gesserat , legionibus in hiberna deductis , in Italiam profectus est Ob easque res ex litteris Caesaris dierum XV supplicatio decreta est , quod ante id tempus accidit nulli . <end>$$He himself , having led his legions into winter quarters among the Carnutes , the Andes , and the Turones , which states were close to those regions in which he had waged war , set out for Italy ; and a thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed for those achievements , upon receiving Caesar's letter ; which before that time had been conferred on none .
<start> Cum in Italiam proficisceretur Caesar , Ser Galbam cum legione XII et parte equitatus in Nantuates , Veragros Sedunosque misit , qui a finibus Allobrogum et lacu Lemanno et flumine Rhodano ad summas Alpes pertinent . <end>$$When Caesar was setting out for Italy , he sent Servius Galba with the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry , against the Nantuates , the Veragri , and Seduni , who extend from the territories of the Allobroges , and the lake of Geneva , and the River Rhône to the top of the Alps .
<start> Causa mittendi fuit quod iter per Alpes , quo magno cum periculo magnisque cum portoriis mercatores ire consuerant , patefieri volebat . <end>$$The reason for sending him was , that he desired that the pass along the Alps , through which merchants had been accustomed to travel with great danger , and under great imposts , should be opened .
<start> Huic permisit , si opus esse arbitraretur , uti in his locis legionem hiemandi causa conlocaret . <end>$$He permitted him , if he thought it necessary , to station the legion in these places , for the purpose of wintering .
<start> Galba secundis aliquot proeliis factis castellisque compluribus eorum expugnatis , missis ad eum undique legatis obsidibusque datis et pace facta , constituit cohortes duas in Nantuatibus conlocare et ipse cum reliquis eius legionis cohortibus in vico Veragrorum , qui appellatur Octodurus hiemare ; qui vicus positus in valle non magna adiecta planitie altissimis montibus undique continetur . <end>$$Galba having fought some successful battles and stormed several of their forts , upon embassadors being sent to him from all parts and hostages given and a peace concluded , determined to station two cohorts among the Nantuates , and to winter in person with the other cohorts of that legion in a village of the Veragri , which is called Octodurus ; and this village being situated in a valley , with a small plain annexed to it , is bounded on all sides by very high mountains .
<start> Cum hic in duas partes flumine divideretur , alteram partem eius vici Gallis concessit , alteram vacuam ab his relictam cohortibus attribuit . <end>$$As this village was divided into two parts by a river , he granted one part of it to the Gauls , and assigned the other , which had been left by them unoccupied , to the cohorts to winter in .
<start> Eum locum vallo fossaque munivit . <end>$$He fortified this part with a rampart and a ditch .
<start> Cum dies hibernorum complures transissent frumentumque eo comportari iussisset , subito per exploratores certior factus est ex ea parte vici , quam Gallis concesserat , omnes noctu discessisse montesque qui impenderent a maxima multitudine Sedunorum et Veragrorum teneri . <end>$$When several days had elapsed in winter quarters , and he had ordered corn to be brought in he was suddenly informed by his scouts that all the people had gone off in the night from that part of the town which he had given up to the Gauls , and that the mountains which hung over it were occupied by a very large force of the Seduni and Veragri .
<start> Id aliquot de causis acciderat , ut subito Galli belli renovandi legionisque opprimendae consilium caperent : primum , quod legionem neque eam plenissimam detractis cohortibus duabus et compluribus singillatim , qui commeatus petendi causa missi erant , absentibus propter paucitatem despiciebant ; tum etiam , quod propter iniquitatem loci , cum ipsi ex montibus in vallem decurrerent et tela coicerent , ne primum quidem impetum suum posse sustineri existimabant . <end>$$It had happened for several reasons that the Gauls suddenly formed the design of renewing the war and cutting off that legion First , because they despised a single legion , on account of its small number , and that not quite full ; then , likewise , because they thought that on account of the disadvantageous character of the situation , even their first attack could not be sustained when they would rush from the mountains into the valley , and discharge their weapons upon us .
<start> Accedebat quod suos ab se liberos abstraetos obsidum nomine dolebant , et Romanos non solum itinerum causa sed etiam perpetuae possessionis culmina Alpium oceupare conari et ea loca finitimae provinciae adiungere sibi persuasum habebant . <end>$$To this was added , that they were indignant that their children were torn from them under the title of hostages , and they were persuaded that the Romans designed to seize upon the summits of the Alps , and unite those parts to the neighboring province , not only to secure the passes , but also a constant possession .
<start> His nuntiis acceptis Galba , cum neque opus hibernorum munitionesque plene essent perfectae neque de frumento reliquoque commeatu satis esset provisum quod deditione facta obsidibusque acceptis nihil de bello timendum existimaverat , consilio celeriter convocato sententias exquirere coepit . <end>$$Having received these tidings , Galba , since the works of the winter-quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed , nor was sufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other provisions , speedily summoning a council , began to anxiously inquire their opinions .
<start> Quo in consilio , cum tantum repentini periculi praeter opinionem accidisset ac iam omnia fere superiora loca multitudine armatorum completa conspicerentur neque subsidio veniri neque commeatus supportari interclusis itineribus possent , prope iam desperata salute non nullae eius modi sententiae dicebantur , ut impedimentis relictis eruptione facta isdem itineribus quibus eo pervenissent ad salutem contenderent . <end>$$In which council , since so much sudden danger had happened contrary to the general expectation , and almost all the higher places were seen already covered with a multitude of armed men , nor could troops come to their relief , or provisions be brought in , as the passes were blocked up ; safety being now nearly despaired of , some opinions of this sort were delivered : that , leaving their baggage , and making a sally , they should hasten away for safety by the same routes by which they had come thither .
<start> Maiori tamen parti placuit , hoc reservato ad extremum casum consilio interim rei eventum experiri et castra defendere . <end>$$To the greater part , however , it seemed best , reserving that measure to the last , to await the issue of the matter , and to defend the camp .
<start> Brevi spatio interiecto , vix ut iis rebus quas constituissent conlocandis atque administrandis tempus daretur , hostes ex omnibus partibus signo dato decurrere , lapides gaesaque in vallum coicere . <end>$$A short time only having elapsed , so that time was scarcely given for arranging and executing those things which they had determined on , the enemy , upon the signal being given , rushed down from all parts , and discharged stones and darts , upon our rampart .
<start> Cum iam amplius horis sex continenter pugnaretur , ac non solum vires sed etiam tela nostros deficerent , atque hostes acrius instarent languidioribusque nostris vallum scindere et fossas complere coepissent , resque esset iam ad extremum perducta casum , Publius Sextius Baculus , primi pili centurio , quem Nervico proelio compluribus confectum vulneribus diximus , et item Gaius Volusenus , tribunus militum , vir et consilii magni et virtutis , ad Galbam accurrunt atque unam esse spem salutis docent , si eruptione facta extremum auxilium experirentur . <end>$$When they had now been fighting for more than six hours , without cessation , and not only strength , but even weapons were failing our men , and the enemy were pressing on more rigorously , and had begun to demolish the rampart and to fill up the trench , while our men were becoming exhausted , and the matter was now brought to the last extremity , Publius Sextius Baculus , a centurion of the first rank , whom we have related to have been disabled by severe wounds in the engagement with the Nervii , and also Gaius Volusenus , a tribune of the soldiers , a man of great skill and valor , hasten to Galba , and assure him that the only hope of safety lay in making a sally , and trying the last resource .
<start> Itaque convocatis centurionibus celeriter milites certiores facit , paulisper intermitterent proelium ac tantum modo tela missa exciperent seque ex labore reficerent , post dato signo ex castris erumperent , atque omnem spem salutis in virtute ponerent . <end>$$Whereupon assembling the centurions , he quickly gives orders to the soldiers to discontinue the fight a short time , and only collect the weapons flung , and recruit themselves after their fatigue , and afterward , upon the signal being given , sally forth from the camp , and place in their valor all their hope of safety .
<start> Quod iussi sunt faciunt , ac subito omnibus portis eruptione facta neque cognoscendi quid fieret neque sui colligendi hostibus facultatem relinquunt . <end>$$They do what they were ordered ; and , making a sudden sally from all the gates , leave the enemy the means neither of knowing what was taking place , nor of collecting themselves .
<start> Ita commutata fortuna eos qui in spem potiundorum castrorum venerant undique circumventos intercipiunt , et ex hominum milibus amplius XXX , quem numerum barbarorum ad castra venisse constabat , plus tertia parte interfecta reliquos perterritos in fugam coiciunt ac ne in locis quidem superioribus consistere patiuntur . <end>$$Fortune thus taking a turn , surround on every side , and slay those who had entertained the hope of gaining the camp and having killed more than the third part of an army of more than 30 , 000 men , put to flight the rest when panic-stricken , and do not suffer them to halt even upon the higher grounds .
<start> Sic omnibus hostium copiis fusis armisque exutis se intra munitiones suas recipiunt . <end>$$All the forces of the enemy being thus routed , and stripped of their arms , betake themselves to their camp and fortifications .
<start> Quo proelio facto , quod saepius fortunam temptare Galba nolebat atque alio se in hiberna consilio venisse meminerat , aliis occurrisse rebus videbat , maxime frumenti inopia permotus postero die omnibus eius vici aedificiis incensis in provinciam reverti contendit , ac nullo hoste prohibente aut iter demorante incolumem legionem in Nantuates , inde in Allobroges perduxit ibique hiemavit . <end>$$Which battle being finished , inasmuch as Galba was unwilling to tempt fortune again , and remembered that he had come into winter quarters with one design , and saw that he had met with a different state of affairs ; chiefly however urged by the want of corn and provision , having the next day burned all the buildings of that village , he hastens to return into the province ; and as no enemy opposed or hindered his march , he brought the legion safe into the Nantuates , thence into the Allobroges , and there wintered .
<start> His rebus gestis cum omnibus de causis Caesar pacatam Galliam existimaret , atque ita inita hieme in Illyricum profectus esset , quod eas quoque nationes adire et regiones cognoseere volebat , subitum bellum in Gallia eoortum est . <end>$$These things being achieved , while Caesar had every reason to suppose that Gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity , the Belgae being overcome , the Germans expelled , the Seduni among the Alps defeated , and when he had , therefore , in the beginning of winter , set out for Illyricum , as he wished to visit those nations , and acquire a knowledge of their countries , a sudden war sprang up in Gaul .
<start> Eius belli haec fuit causa Publius Crassus adulescens eum legione VII proximus mare Oeeanum in Andibus hiemabat . <end>$$The occasion of that war was this : Publius Crassus , a young man , had taken up his winter quarters with the seventh legion among the Andes , who border upon the ocean .
<start> Is , quod in his loeis inopia frumenti erat , praefectos tribunosque militum eomplures in finitimas civitates frumenti causa dimisit ; quo in numero est Titus Terrasidius missus in Esuvios , Marcus Trebius Gallus in Coriosolites , Quintus Velanius eum Titus Silio in Venetos . <end>$$He , as there was a scarcity of corn in those parts , sent out some officers of cavalry , and several military tribunes among the neighbouring states , for the purpose of procuring corn and provision ; in which number Titus Terrasidius was sent among the Esubii ; Marcus Trebius Gallus among the Coriosolitae ; Quintus Velanius , Titus Silius , amongst the Veneti .
<start> Huius est civitatis longe amplissima auctoritas omnis orae maritimae regionum earum , quod et naves habent Veneti plurimas , quibus in Britanniam navigare consuerunt , et scientia atque usu rerum nauticarum ceteros antecedunt et in magno impetu maris atque aperto paucis portibus interiectis , quos tenent ipsi , omnes fere qui eo mari uti consuerunt habent vectigales . <end>$$The influence of this state is by far the most considerable of any of the countries on the whole sea coast , because the Veneti both have a very great number of ships , with which they have been accustomed to sail to Britain , and excel the rest in their knowledge and experience of nautical affairs ; and as only a few ports lie scattered along that stormy and open sea , of which they are in possession , they hold as tributaries almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in that sea .
<start> Ab his fit initium retinendi Silii atque Velanii , quod per eos suos se obsides , quos Crasso dedissent , recuperaturos existimabant . <end>$$With them arose the beginning by their detaining Silius and Velanius ; for they thought that they should recover by their means the hostages which they had given to Crassus .
<start> Horum auctoritate finitimi adducti , ut sunt Gallorum subita et repentina consilia , eadem de causa Trebium Terrasidiumque retinent et celeriter missis legatis per suos principes inter se coniurant nihil nisi communi consilio acturos eundemque omnes fortunae exitum esse laturos , reliquasque civitates sollicitant , ut in ea libertate quam a maioribus acceperint permanere quam Romanorum servitutem perferre malint . <end>$$The neighboring people led on by their influence , detain Trebius and Terrasidius for the same motive ; and quickly sending embassadors , by means of their leading men , they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except by general consent , and abide the same issue of fortune ; and they solicit the other states to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they had received from their ancestors , than endure slavery under the Romans .
<start> Omni ora maritima celeriter ad suam sententiam perducta communem legationem ad Publius Crassum mittunt , si velit suos recuperare , obsides sibi remittat . <end>$$All the sea coast being quickly brought over to their sentiments , they send a common embassy to Publius Crassus , If he wished to receive back his officers , let him send back to them their hostages .
<start> Quibus de rebus Caesar a Crasso certior factus , quod ipse aberat longius , naves interim longas aedificari in flumine Ligeri , quod influit in Oceanum , remiges ex provincia institui , nautas gubernatoresque comparari iubet . <end>$$Caesar , being informed of these things by Crassus , since he was so far distant himself , orders ships of war to be built in the mean time on the river Loire , which flows into the ocean ; rowers to be raised from the province ; sailors and pilots to be provided .
<start> Veneti reliquaeque item civitates cognito Caesaris adventu , simul quod quantum in se facinus admisissent intellegebant , pro magnitudine periculi bellum parare et maxime ea quae ad usum navium pertinent providere instituunt , hoc maiore spe quod multum natura loci confidebant . <end>$$They knew that the passes by land were cut off by estuaries , that the approach by sea was most difficult , by reason of our ignorance of the localities , the small number of the harbors , and they trusted that our army would not be able to stay very long among them , on account of the insufficiency of corn ; and again , even if all these things should turn out contrary to their expectation , yet they were very powerful in their navy .
<start> Pedestria esse itinera concisa aestuariis , navigationem impeditam propter inscientiam locorum paucitatemque portuum sciebant , neque nostros exercitus propter inopiam frumenti diutius apud se morari posse confidebant ; ac iam ut omnia contra opinionem acciderent , tamen se plurimum navibus posse , Romanos neque ullam facultatem habere navium , neque eorum locorum ubi bellum gesturi essent vada , portus , insulas novisse ; ac longe aliam esse navigationem in concluso mari atque in vastissimo atque apertissimo Oceano perspiciebant . <end>$$They well understood that the Romans neither had any number of ships , nor were acquainted with the shallows , the harbors , or the islands of those parts where they would have to carry on the war ; and the navigation was very different in a narrow sea from what it was in the vast and open ocean .
<start> His initis consiliis oppida muniunt , frumenta ex agris in oppida comportant , naves in Venetiam , ubi Caesarem primum bellum gesturum constabat , quam plurimas possunt cogunt . <end>$$Having come to this resolution , they fortify their towns , convey corn into them from the country parts , bring together as many ships as possible to Venetia , where it appeared Caesar would at first carry on the war .
<start> Erant hae difficultates belli gerendi quas supra ostendimus , sed tamen multa Caesarem ad id bellum incitabant : iniuria retentorum equitum Romanorum , rebellio facta post deditionem , defectio datis obsidibus , tot civitatum coniuratio , in primis ne hac parte neglecta reliquae nationes sibi idem licere arbitrarentur . <end>$$There were these difficulties which we have mentioned above , in carrying on the war , but many things , nevertheless , urged Caesar to that war ; —the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the Roman knights , the rebellion raised after surrendering , the revolt after hostages were given , the confederacy of so many states , but principally , lest if , this part was overlooked , the other nations should think that the same thing was permitted them .
<start> Itaque cum intellegeret omnes fere Gallos novis rebus studere et ad bellum mobiliter celeriterque excitari , omnes autem homines natura libertati studere et condicionem servitutis odisse , prius quam plures civitates conspirarent , partiendum sibi ac latius distribuendum exercitum putavit . <end>$$Wherefore , since he reflected that almost all the Gauls were fond of revolution , and easily and quickly excited to war ; that all men likewise , by nature , love liberty and hate the condition of slavery , he thought he ought to divide and more widely distribute his army , before more states should join the confederation .
<start> Itaque Titus Labienum legatum in Treveros , qui proximi flumini Rheno sunt , cum equitatu mittit . <end>$$He therefore sends Titus Labienus , his legate , with the cavalry to the Treveri , who are nearest to the river Rhine .
<start> Huic mandat , Remos reliquosque Belgas adeat atque in officio contineat Germanosque , qui auxilio a Belgis arcessiti dicebantur , si per vim navibus flumen transire conentur , prohibeat . <end>$$He charges him to visit the Remi and the other Belgae , and to keep them in their allegiance and repel the Germans if they attempted to cross the river by force in their ships .
<start> Publius Crassum cum cohortibus legionariis XII et magno numero equitatus in Aquitaniam proficisci iubet , ne ex his nationibus auxilia in Galliam mittantur ac tantae nationes coniungantur . <end>$$He orders Publius Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with twelve legionary cohorts and a great number of the cavalry , lest auxiliaries should be sent into Gaul by these states , and such great nations be united .
<start> Quintus Titurium Sabinum legatum cum legionibus tribus in Venellos , Coriosolites Lexoviosque mittit , qui eam manum distinendam curet . <end>$$He sends Quintus Titurius Sabinus his legate , with three legions , among the Venelli , the Coriosolitae , and the Lexovii , to take care that their forces should be kept separate from the rest .
<start> D Brutum adulescentem classi Gallicisque navibus , quas ex Pictonibus et Santonis reliquisque pacatis regionibus convenire iusserat , praeficit et , cum primum possit , in Venetos proficisci iubet . <end>$$He appoints Decimus Brutus , a young man , over the fleet and those Gallic vessels which he had ordered to be furnished by the Pictones and the Santoni , and the other provinces which remained at peace ; and commands him to proceed toward the Veneti , as soon as he could .
<start> Ipse eo pedestribus copiis contendit . <end>$$He himself hastens thither with the land forces .
<start> Erant eius modi fere situs oppidorum ut posita in extremis lingulis promunturiisque neque pedibus aditum haberent , cum ex alto se aestus incitavisset , quod accidit semper horarum XII spatio , neque navibus , quod rursus minuente aestu naves in vadis adflictarentur . <end>$$The sites of their towns were generally such that , being placed on extreme points and on promontories , they neither had an approach by land when the tide had rushed in from the main ocean , which always happens twice in the space of twelve hours ; nor by ships , because , upon the tide ebbing again , the ships were likely to be dashed upon the shoals .
<start> Ita utraque re oppidorum oppugnatio impediebatur Ac si quando magnitudine operis forte superati , extruso mari aggere ac molibus atque his oppidi moenibus adaequatis , suis fortunis desperare coeperant , magno numero navium adpulso , cuius rei summam facultatem habebant , omnia sua deportabant seque in proxima oppida recipiebant : ibi se rursus isdem oportunitatibus loci defendebant . <end>$$Thus , by either circumstance , was the storming of their towns rendered difficult ; and if at any time perchance the Veneti overpowered by the greatness of our works , had begun to despair of their fortunes ; bringing up a large number of ships , of which they had a very great quantity , they carried off all their property and betook themselves to the nearest towns ; there they again defended themselves by the same advantages of situation .
<start> Haec eo facilius magnam partem aestatis faciebant quod nostrae naves tempestatibus detinebantur summaque erat vasto atque aperto mari , magnis aestibus , raris ac prope nullis portibus difficultas navigandi . <end>$$They did this the more easily during a great part of the summer , because our ships were kept back by storms , and the difficulty of sailing was very great in that vast and open sea , with its strong tides and its harbors far apart and exceedingly few in number .
<start> Namque ipsorum naves ad hunc modum factae armataeque erant : carinae aliquanto planiores quam nostrarum navium , quo facilius vada ac decessum aestus excipere possent ; prorae admodum erectae atque item puppes , ad magnitudinem fluctuum tempestatumque accommodatae ; naves totae factae ex robore ad quamvis vim et contumeliam perferendam ; transtra ex pedalibus in altitudinem trabibus , confixa clavis ferreis digiti pollicis crassitudine ; ancorae pro funibus ferreis catenis revinctae ; pelles pro velis alutaeque tenuiter confectae , sive propter inopiam lini atque eius usus inscientiam , sive eo , quod est magis veri simile , quod tantas tempestates Oceani tantosque impetus ventorum sustineri ac tanta onera navium regi velis non satis commode posse arbitrabantur . <end>$$For their ships were built and equipped after this manner The keels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships , whereby they could more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide : the prows were raised very high , and , in like manner the sterns were adapted to the force of the waves and storms The ships were built wholly of oak , and designed to endure any force and violence whatever ; the benches which were made of planks a foot in breadth , were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb ; the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables , and for sails they used skins and thin dressed leather .
<start> Cum his navibus nostrae classi eius modi congressus erat ut una celeritate et pulsu remorum praestaret , reliqua pro loci natura , pro vi tempestatum illis essent aptiora et accommodatiora . <end>$$These either through their want of canvas and their ignorance of its application , or for this reason , which is more probable , that they thought that such storms of the ocean , and such violent gales of wind could not be resisted by sails , nor ships of such great burden be conveniently enough managed by them .
<start> Accedebat ut , cum se vento dedissent , et tempestatem ferrent facilius et in vadis consisterent tutius et ab aestu relictae nihil saxa et cotes timerent ; quarum rerum omnium nostris navibus casus erat extimescendus . <end>$$To this was added , that whenever a storm began to rage and they ran before the wind , they both could weather the storm more easily and heave to securely in the shallows , and when left by the tide feared nothing from rocks and shelves : the risk of all which things was much to be dreaded by our ships .
<start> Compluribus expugnatis oppidis Caesar , ubi intellexit frustra tantum laborem sumi neque hostium fugam captis oppidis reprimi neque iis noceri posse , statuit expectandam classem . <end>$$Caesar , after taking many of their towns , perceiving that so much labor was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be prevented on the capture of their towns , and that injury could not be done them , he determined to wait for his fleet .
<start> Quae ubi convenit ac primum ab hostibus visa est , circiter CCXX naves eorum paratissimae atque omni genere armorum ornatissimae profectae ex portu nostris adversae constiterunt ; neque satis Bruto , qui classi praeerat , vel tribunis militum centurionibusque , quibus singulae naves erant attributae , constabat quid agerent aut quam rationem pugnae insisterent Rostro enim noceri non posse cognoverant ; turribus autem excitatis tamen has altitudo puppium ex barbaris navibus superabat , ut neque ex inferiore loco satis commode tela adigi possent et missa a Gallis gravius acciderent . <end>$$As soon as it came up and was first seen by the enemy , about 220 of their ships , fully equipped and appointed with every kind of implement , sailed forth from the harbor , and drew up opposite to ours ; nor did it appear clear to Brutus , who commanded the fleet , or to the tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions , to whom the several ships were assigned , what to do , or what system of tactics to adopt ; for they knew that damage could not be done by their beaks ; and that , although turrets were built , yet the height of the stems of the barbarian ships exceeded these ; so that weapons could not be cast up from lower position with sufficient effect , and those cast by the Gauls fell the more forcibly upon us .
<start> Una erat magno usui res praeparata a nostris , falces praeacutae insertae adfixaeque longuriis , non absimili forma muralium falcium . <end>$$One thing provided by our men was of great service , sharp hooks inserted into and fastened upon poles , of a form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls .
<start> His cum funes qui antemnas ad malos destinabant comprehensi adductique erant , navigio remis incitato praerumpebantur Quibus abscisis antemnae necessario concidebant , ut , cum omnis Gallicis navibus spes in velis armamentisque consisteret , his ereptis omnis usus navium uno tempore eriperetur . <end>$$When the ropes which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by them and pulled , and our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars , they were severed ; and when they were cut away , the yards necessarily fell down ; so that as all the hope of the Gallic vessels depended on their sails and rigging , upon these being cut away , the entire management of the ships was taken from them at the same time .
<start> Reliquum erat certamen positum in virtute , qua nostri milites facile superabant , atque eo magis quod in conspectu Caesaris atque omnis exercitus res gerebatur , ut nullum paulo fortius factum latere posset ; omnes enim colles ac loca superiora , unde erat propinquus despectus in mare , ab exercitu tenebantur . <end>$$The rest of the contest depended on courage ; in which our men decidedly had the advantage ; and the more so , because the whole action was carried on in the sight of Caesar and the entire army ; so that no act , a little more valiant than ordinary , could pass unobserved , for all the hills and higher grounds , from which there was a near prospect of the sea were occupied by our army .
<start> Deiectis , ut diximus , antemnis , cum singulas binae ac ternae naves circumsteterant , milites summa vi transcendere in hostium naves contendebant Quod postquam barbari fieri animadverterunt , expugnatis compluribus navibus , cum ei rei nullum reperiretur auxilium , fuga salutem petere contenderunt . <end>$$The sail yards , as we have said , being brought down , although two and three ships surrounded each one , the soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the ships of the enemy ; and , after the barbarians observed this taking place , as a great many of their ships were beaten , and as no relief for that evil could be discovered , they hastened to seek safety in flight .
<start> Quo proelio bellum Venetorum totiusque orae maritimae confectum est Nam cum omnis iuventus , omnes etiam gravioris aetatis in quibus aliquid consilii aut dignitatis fuit eo convenerant , tum navium quod ubique fuerat in unum locum coegerant ; quibus amissis reliqui neque quo se reciperent neque quem ad modum oppida defenderent habebant . <end>$$By this battle the war with the Veneti and the whole of the sea coast was finished ; for both all the youth , and all , too , of more advanced age , in whom there was any discretion or rank , had assembled in that battle ; and they had collected in that one place whatever naval forces they had anywhere ; and when these were lost , the survivors had no place to retreat to , nor means of defending their towns .
<start> Itaque se suaque omnia Caesari dediderunt In quos eo gravius Caesar vindicandum statuit quo diligentius in reliquum tempus a barbaris ius legatorum conservaretur Itaque omni senatu necato reliquos sub corona vendidit . <end>$$They accordingly surrendered themselves and all their possessions to Caesar , on whom Caesar thought that punishment should be inflicted the more severely , in order that for the future the rights of embassadors might be more carefully respected by barbarians ; having , therefore , put to death all their senate , he sold the rest for slaves .
<start> Dum haec in Venetis geruntur , Quintus Titurius Sabinus cum iis copiis quas a Caesare acceperat in fines Venellorum pervenit . <end>$$While these things are going on among the Veneti , Quintus Titurius Sabinus with those troops which he had received from Caesar , arrives in the territories of the Venelli .
<start> His praeerat Viridovix ac summam imperii tenebat earum omnium civitatum quae defecerant , ex quibus exercitum coegerat ; atque his paucis diebus Aulerci Eburovices Lexoviique , senatu suo interfecto quod auctores belli esse nolebant , portas clauserunt seque cum Viridovice coniunxerunt ; magnaque praeterea multitudo undique ex Gallia perditorum hominum latronumque convenerat , quos spes praedandi studiumque bellandi ab agri cultura et cotidiano labore revocabat . <end>$$Over these people Viridovix ruled , and held the chief command of all those states which had revolted ; from which he had collected a large and powerful army And in those few days , the Aulerci and the Lexovii , having slain their senate because they would not consent to be promoters of the war , shut their gates and united themselves to Viridovix ; a great multitude besides of desperate men and robbers assembled out of Gaul from all quarters , whom the hope of plundering and the love of fighting had called away from husbandry and their daily labor .
<start> Sabinus idoneo omnibus rebus loco castris sese tenebat , cum Viridovix contra eum duorum milium spatio consedisset cotidieque productis copiis pugnandi potestatem faceret , ut iam non solum hostibus in contemptionem Sabinus veniret , sed etiam nostrorum militum vocibus non nihil carperetur ; tantamque opinionem timoris praebuit ut iam ad vallum castrorum hostes accedere auderent . <end>$$Sabinus kept himself within his camp , which was in a position convenient for everything ; while Viridovix encamped over against him at a distance of two miles , and daily bringing out his forces , gave him an opportunity of fighting ; so that Sabinus had now not only come into contempt with the enemy , but also was somewhat taunted by the speeches of our soldiers ; and furnished so great a suspicion of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to approach even to the very rampart of our camp .
<start> Id ea de causa faciebat quod cum tanta multitudine hostium , praesertim eo absente qui summam imperii teneret , nisi aequo loco aut oportunitate aliqua data legato dimicandum non existimabat . <end>$$He adopted this conduct for the following reason : because he did not think that a legate ought to engage in battle with so great a force , especially while he who held the chief command was absent , except on advantageous ground or some favorable circumstance presented itself .
<start> Hac confirmata opinione timoris idoneum quendam hominem et callidum deligit , Gallum , ex iis quos auxilii causa secum habebat . <end>$$After having established this suspicion of his cowardice , he selected a certain suitable and crafty Gaul , who was one of those whom he had with him as auxiliaries .
<start> Huic magnis praemiis pollicitationibusque persuadet uti ad hostes transeat , et quid fieri velit edocet . <end>$$He induces him by great gifts and promises to go over to the enemy ; and informs of what he wished to be done .
<start> Qui ubi pro perfuga ad eos venit , timorem Romanorum proponit , quibus angustiis ipse Caesar a Venetis prematur docet , eque longius abesse quin proxima nocte Sabinus clam ex castris exercitum educat et ad Caesarem auxilii ferendi causa proficiscatur Quod ubi auditum est , conclamant omnes occasionem negotii bene gerendi amittendam non esse : ad castra iri oportere . <end>$$Who , when he arrives among them as a deserter , lays before them the fears of the Romans ; and informs them by what difficulties Caesar himself was harassed , and that the matter was not far removed from this—that Sabinus would the next night privately draw off his army out of the camp and set forth to Caesar for the purpose of carrying assistance , which , when they heard , they all cry out together that an opportunity of successfully conducting their enterprise , ought not to be thrown away : that they ought to go to the camp .
<start> Multae res ad hoc consilium Gallos hortabantur : superiorum dierum Sabini cunctatio , perfugae confirmatio , inopia cibariorum , cui rei parum diligenter ab iis erat provisum , spes Venetici belli , et quod fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt . <end>$$Many things persuaded the Gauls to this measure ; the delay of Sabinus during the previous days ; the positive assertion of the deserter ; want of provisions , for a supply of which they had not taken the requisite precautions ; the hope springing from the Venetic war ; and because in most cases men willingly believe what they wish .
<start> His rebus adducti non prius Viridovicem reliquosque duces ex concilio dimittunt quam ab iis sit concessum arma uti capiant et ad castra contendant Qua re concessa laeti , ut explorata victoria , sarmentis virgultisque collectis , quibus fossas Romanorum compleant , ad castra pergunt . <end>$$Influenced by these things they do not discharge Viridovix and the other leaders from the council , before they gained permission from them to take up arms and hasten to camp ; which being granted , rejoicing as if victory were fully certain , they collected faggots and brushwood , with which to fill up the Roman trenches , and hasten to the camp .
<start> Locus erat castrorum editus et paulatim ab imo acclivis circiter passus mille . <end>$$The situation of the camp was a rising ground , gently sloping from the bottom for about a mile .
<start> Huc magno cursu contenderunt , ut quam minimum spatii ad se colligendos armandosque Romanis daretur , exanimatique pervenerunt . <end>$$Thither they proceeded with great speed , and arrived quite out of breath .
<start> Sabinus suos hortatus cupientibus signum dat Impeditis hostibus propter ea quae ferebant onera subito duabus portis eruptionem fieri iubet . <end>$$Sabinus having encouraged his men , gives them the signal , which they earnestly desired .
<start> Factum est oportunitate loci , hostium inscientia ac defatigatione , virtute militum et superiorum pugnarum exercitatione , ut ne unum quidem nostrorum impetum ferrent ac statim terga verterent . <end>$$While the enemy were encumbered by reason of the burdens which they were carrying , he orders a sally to be made suddenly from two gates  .
<start> Quos impeditos integris viribus milites nostri consecuti magnum numerum eorum occiderunt ; reliquos equites consectati paucos , qui ex fuga evaserant , reliquerunt Sic uno tempore et de navali pugna Sabinus et de Sabini victoria Caesar est certior factus , civitatesque omnes se statim Titurio dediderunt . <end>$$It happened , by the advantage of situation , by the unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy , by the valor of our soldiers , and their experience in former battles , that they could not stand one attack of our men , and immediately turned their backs ; and our men with full vigor followed them while disordered , and slew a great number of them ; the horse pursuing the rest , left but few , who escaped by flight .
<start> Eodem fere tempore Publius Crassus , cum in Aquitaniam pervenisset , quae , ut ante dictum est , tertia pars Galliae est , cum intellegeret in iis locis sibi bellum gerendum ubi paucis ante annis Lucius Valerius Praeconinus legatus exercitu pulso interfectus esset atque unde Lucius Manlius proconsul impedimentis amissis profugisset , non mediocrem sibi diligentiam adhibendam intellegebat . <end>$$About the same time , Publius Crassus , when he had arrived in Aquitania understanding that he was to wage war in these parts , where a few years before , Lucius Valerius Praeconinus , the legate had been killed , and his army routed , and from which Lucius Manilius , the proconsul , had fled with the loss of his baggage , he perceived that no ordinary care must be used by him .
<start> Itaque re frumentaria provisa , auxiliis equitatuque comparato , multis praeterea viris fortibus Tolosa et Carcasone et Narbone , quae sunt civitates Galliae provinciae finitimae , ex his regionibus nominatim evocatis , in Sotiatium fines exercitum introduxit . <end>$$Wherefore , having provided corn , procured auxiliaries and cavalry , having summoned by name many valiant men from Tolosa , Carcaso , and Narbo , which are the states of the province of Gaul , that border on these regions , he led his army into the territories of the Sotiates .
<start> Cuius adventu cognito Sotiates magnis copiis coactis , equitatuque , quo plurimum valebant , in itinere agmen nostrum adorti primum equestre proelium commiserunt , deinde equitatu suo pulso atque insequentibus nostris subito pedestres copias , quas in convalle in insidiis conlocaverant , ostenderunt . <end>$$On his arrival being known , the Sotiates having brought together great forces and cavalry , in which their strength principally lay , and assailing our army on the march , engaged first in a cavalry action , then when their cavalry was routed , and our men pursuing , they suddenly display their infantry forces , which they had placed in ambuscade in a valley .
<start> Hi nostros disiectos adorti proelium renovarunt . <end>$$These attacked our men disordered , and renewed the fight .
<start> Pugnatum est diu atque acriter , cum Sotiates superioribus victoriis freti in sua virtute totius Aquitaniae salutem positam putarent , nostri autem quid sine imperatore et sine reliquis legionibus adulescentulo duce efficere possent perspici cuperent ; tandem confecti vulneribus hostes terga verterunt . <end>$$The battle was long and vigorously contested , since the Sotiates , relying on their former victories , imagined that the safety of the whole of Aquitania rested on their valor ; our men , on the other hand , desired it might be seen what they could accomplish without their general and without the other legions , under a very young commander ; at length the enemy , worn out with wounds , began to turn their backs , and a great number of them being slain , Crassus began to besiege the town of the Sotiates on his march .
<start> Quorum magno numero interfecto Crassus ex itinere oppidum Sotiatium oppugnare coepit . <end>$$Upon their valiantly resisting , he raised vineae and turrets .
<start> Qua re impetrata arma tradere iussi faciunt Atque in eam rem omnium nostrorum intentis animis alia ex parte oppidi Adiatunnus , qui summam imperii tenebat , cum DC devotis , quos illi soldurios appellant , quorum haec est condicio , ut omnibus in vita commodis una cum iis fruantur quorum se amicitiae dediderint , si quid his per vim accidat , aut eundem casum una ferant aut sibi mortem consciscant ; neque adhuc hominum memoria repertus est quisquam qui , eo interfecto cuius se amicitiae devovisset , mortem recusaret--- cum his Adiatunnus eruptionem facere conatus clamore ab ea parte munitionis sublato cum ad arma milites concurrissent vehementerque ibi pugnatum esset , repulsus in oppidum tamen uti eadem deditionis condicione uteretur a Crasso impetravit . <end>$$And while the attention of our men is engaged in that matter , in another part Adiatunnus , who held the chief command , with 600 devoted followers whom they call soldurii ; Adiatunnus , endeavoring to make a sally with these , when our soldiers had rushed together to arms , upon a shout being raised at that part of the , fortification , and a fierce battle had been fought there , was driven back into the town , yet he obtained from Crassus that he should enjoy the same terms of surrender  .
<start> Armis obsidibusque acceptis , Crassus in fines Vocatium et Tarusatium profectus est . <end>$$Crassus , having received their arms and hostages , marched into the territories of the Vocates and the Tarusates .
<start> Tum vero barbari commoti , quod oppidum et natura loci et manu munitum paucis diebus quibus eo ventum erat expugnatum cognoverant , legatos quoque versus dimittere , coniurare , obsides inter se dare , copias parare coeperunt . <end>$$But then , the barbarians being alarmed , because they had heard that a town fortified by the nature of the place and by art , had been taken by us in a few days after our arrival there , began to send embassadors into all quarters , to combine , to give hostages one to another , to raise troops .
<start> Mittuntur etiam ad eas civitates legati quae sunt citerioris Hispaniae finitimae Aquitaniae : inde auxilia ducesque arcessuntur . <end>$$Embassadors also are sent to those states of Hither Spain which are nearest to Aquitania , and auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them ; on whose arrival they proceed to carry on the war with great confidence , and with a great host of men .
<start> Quorum adventu magna cum auctoritate et magna hominum multitudine bellum gerere conantur . <end>$$They who had been with Quintus Sertorius the whole period and were supposed to have very great skill in military matters , are chosen leaders .
<start> Duces vero ii deliguntur qui una cum Quintus Sertorio omnes annos fuerant summamque scientiam rei militaris habere existimabantur Hi consuetudine populi Romani loca capere , castra munire , commeatibus nostros intercludere instituunt Quod ubi Crassus animadvertit , suas copias propter exiguitatem non facile diduci , hostem et vagari et vias obsidere et castris satis praesidii relinquere , ob eam causam minus commode frumentum commeatumque sibi supportari , in dies hostium numcrum augeri , non cunctandum existimavit quin pugna decertaret . <end>$$These , adopting the practice of the Roman people , begin to select places , to fortify their camp , to cut off our men from provisions , which , when Crassus observes , that his forces , on account of their small number could not safely be separated ; that the enemy both made excursions and beset the passes , and left sufficient guard for their camp ; that on that account , corn and provision could not very conveniently be brought up to him , and that the number of the enemy was daily increased , he thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle .
<start> Hac re ad consilium delata , ubi omnes idem sentire intellexit , posterum diem pugnae constituit . <end>$$This matter being brought to a council , when he discovered that all thought the same thing , he appointed the next day for the fight .
<start> Prima luce productis omnibus copiis duplici acie instituta , auxiliis in mediam aciem coniectis , quid hostes consilii caperent expectabat . <end>$$Having drawn out all his forces at the break of day , and marshaled them in a double line , he posted the auxiliaries in the center , and waited to see what measures the enemy would take .
<start> Ibi cum alii fossas complerent , alii multis telis coniectis defensores vallo munitionibusque depellerent , auxiliaresque , quibus ad pugnam non multum Crassus confidebat , lapidibus telisque subministrandis et ad aggerem caespitibus comportandis speciem atque opinionem pugnantium praeberent , cum item ab hostibus constanter ac non timide pugnaretur telaque ex loco superiore missa non frustra acciderent , equites circumitis hostium castris Crasso renuntiaverunt non eadem esse diligentia ab decumana porta castra munita facilemque aditum habere . <end>$$There , while some were filling up the ditch , and others , by throwing a large number of darts , were driving the defenders from the rampart and fortifications , and the auxiliaries , on whom Crassus did not much rely in the battle , by supplying stones and weapons , and by conveying turf to the mound , presented the appearance and character of men engaged in fighting ; while also the enemy were fighting resolutely and boldly , and their weapons , discharged from their higher position , fell with great effect ; the horse , having gone round the camp of the enemy , reported to Crassus that the camp was not fortified with equal care on the side of the Decuman gate , and had an easy approach .
<start> Crassus equitum praefectos cohortatus , ut magnis praemiis pollicitationibusque suos excitarent , quid fieri vellet ostendit . <end>$$Crassus , having exhorted the commanders of the horse to animate their men by great rewards and promises , points out to them what he wished to have done .
<start> Illi , ut erat imperatum , eductis iis cohortibus quae praesidio castris relictae intritae ab labore erant , et longiore itinere circumductis , ne ex hostium castris conspici possent , omnium oculis mentibusque ad pugnam intentis celeriter ad eas quas diximus munitiones pervenerunt atque his prorutis prius in hostium castris constiterunt quam plane ab his videri aut quid rei gereretur cognosci posset . <end>$$They , as they had been commanded , having brought out the four cohorts , which , as they had been left as a guard for the camp , were not fatigued by exertion , and having led them round by a some what longer way , lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy , when the eyes and minds of all were intent upon the battle , quickly arrived at those fortifications which we have spoken of , and , having demolished these , stood in the camp of the enemy before they were seen by them , or it was known what was going on .
<start> Tum vero clamore ab ea parte audito nostri redintegratis viribus , quod plerumque in spe victoriae accidere consuevit , acrius impugnare coeperunt . <end>$$And then , a shout being heard in that quarter , our men , their strength having been recruited , , began to fight more vigorously .
<start> Hostes undique circumventi desperatis omnibus rebus se per munitiones deicere et fuga salutem petere contenderunt . <end>$$The enemy surrounded on all sides , all their affairs being despaired of , made great attempts to cast themselves down over the ramparts and to seek safety in flight .
<start> Quos equitatus apertissimis campis consectatus ex milium L numero , quae ex Aquitania Cantabrisque convenisse constabat , vix quarta parte relicta , multa nocte se in castra recepit . <end>$$These the cavalry pursued over the very open plains , and after leaving scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50 , 000 , which it was certain had assembled out of Aquitania and from the Cantabri , returned late at night to the camp .
<start> Eodem fere tempore Caesar , etsi prope exacta iam aestas erat , tamen , quod omni Gallia pacata Morini Menapiique supererant , qui in armis essent neque ad eum umquam legatos de pace misissent , arbitratus id bellum celeriter confici posse eo exercitum duxit ; qui longe alia ratione ac reliqui Galli bellum gerere coeperunt . <end>$$About the same time Caesar , although the summer was nearly past , yet , since , all Gaul being reduced , the Morini and the Menapii alone remained in arms , and had never sent embassadors to him of peace , speedily led his army thither , thinking that that war might soon be terminated .
<start> Nam quod intellegebant maximas nationes , quae proelio contendissent , pulsas superatasque esse , continentesque silvas ac paludes habebant , eo se suaque omnia contulerunt . <end>$$They resolved to conduct the war on a very different method from the rest of the Gauls ; for as they perceived that the greatest nations who had engaged in war , had been routed and overcome , and as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and morasses , they removed themselves and all their property thither .
<start> Ad quarum initium silvarum cum Caesar pervenisset castraque munire instituisset neque hostis interim visus esset , dispersis in opere nostris subito ex omnibus partibus silvae evolaverunt et in nostros impetum fecerunt . <end>$$When Caesar had arrived at the opening of these forests , and had began to fortify his camp , and no enemy was in the mean time seen , while our men were dispersed on their respective duties , they suddenly rushed out from all parts of the forest , and made an attack on our men .
<start> Nostri celeriter arma ceperunt eosque in silvas repulerunt et compluribus interfectis longius impeditioribus locis secuti paucos ex suis deperdiderunt . <end>$$The latter quickly took up arms and drove them back again to their forests ; and having killed a great many , lost a few of their own men while pursuing them too far through those intricate places .
<start> Reliquis deinceps diebus Caesar silvas caedere instituit , et ne quis inermibus imprudentibusque militibus ab latere impetus fieri posset , omnem eam materiam quae erat caesa conversam ad hostem conlocabat et pro vallo ad utrumque latus extruebat . <end>$$During the remaining days after this , Caesar began to cut down the forests ; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the soldiers , while unarmed and not foreseeing it , he placed together all that timber which was cut down , and piled it up as a rampart on either flank .
<start> Incredibili celeritate magno spatio paucis diebus confecto , cum iam pecus atque extrema impedimenta a nostris tenerentur , ipsi densiores silvas peterent , eius modi sunt tempestates consecutae uti opus necessario intermitteretur et continuatione imbrium diutius sub pellibus milites contineri non possent . <end>$$When a great space had been , with incredible speed , cleared in a few days , when the cattle and the rear of their baggage train were already seized by our men , and they themselves were seeking for the thickest parts of the forests , storms of such a kind came on that the work was necessarily suspended , and , through the continuance of the rains , the soldiers could not any longer remain in their tents .
<start> Itaque vastatis omnibus eorum agris , vicis aedificiisque incensis , Caesar exercitum reduxit et in Aulercis Lexoviisque , reliquis item civitatibus quae proxime bellum fecerant , in hibernis conlocavit . <end>$$Therefore , having laid waste all their country , having burned their villages and houses , Caesar led back his army and stationed them in winter quarters among the Aulerci and Lexovii , and the other states which had made war upon him last .
<start> Ea quae secuta est hieme , qui fuit annus Gnaeus Pompeio , Marcus Crasso consulibus , Usipetes Germani et item Tencteri magna multitudine hominum flumen Rhenum transierunt , non longe a mari , quo Rhenus influit . <end>$$The following winter , those Germans the Usipetes , and likewise the Tencteri , with a great number of men , crossed the Rhine , not far from the place at which that river discharges itself into the sea .
<start> Causa transeundi fuit quod ab Suebis complures annos exagitati bello premebantur et agri cultura prohibebantur . <end>$$The motive for crossing was , that having been for several years harassed by the Suevi , they were constantly engaged in war , and hindered from the pursuits of agriculture .
<start> Sueborum gens est longe maxima et bellicosissima Germanorum omnium . <end>$$The nation of the Suevi is by far the largest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans .
<start> Reliqui , qui domi manserunt , se atque illos alunt ; hi rursus in vicem anno post in armis sunt , illi domi remanent . <end>$$The latter again , in their turn , are in arms the year after : the former remain at home .
<start> Sic neque agri cultura nec ratio atque usus belli intermittitur . <end>$$Thus neither husbandry , nor the art and practice of war are neglected .
<start> Sed privati ac separati agri apud eos nihil est , neque longius anno remanere uno in loco colendi causa licet . <end>$$But among them there exists no private and separate land ; nor are they permitted to remain more than one year in one place for the purpose of residence .
<start> Neque multum frumento , sed maximam partem lacte atque pecore vivunt multum sunt in venationibus ; quae res et cibi genere et cotidiana exercitatione et libertate vitae , quod a pueris nullo officio aut disciplina adsuefacti nihil omnino contra voluntatem faciunt , et vires alit et immani corporum magnitudine homines efficit . <end>$$They do not live much on corn , but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh , and are much in hunting ; which circumstance must , by the nature of their food , and by their daily exercise and the freedom of their life , both promote their strength and render them men of vast stature of body .
<start> Atque in eam se consuetudinem adduxerunt ut locis frigidissimis neque vestitus praeter pelles habeant quicquam , quarum propter exiguitatem magna est corporis pars aperta , et laventur in fluminibus . <end>$$And to such a habit have they brought themselves , that even in the coldest parts they wear no clothing whatever except skins , by reason of the scantiness of which , a great portion of their body is bare , and besides they bathe in open rivers .
<start> Mercatoribus est aditus magis eo ut quae bello ceperint quibus vendant habeant , quam quo ullam rem ad se importari desiderent . <end>$$Merchants have access to them rather that they may have persons to whom they may sell those things which they have taken in war , than because they need any commodity to be imported to them .
<start> Quin etiam iumentis , quibus maxime Galli delectantur quaeque impenso parant pretio , Germani importatis non utuntur , sed quae sunt apud eos nata , parva atque deformia , haec cotidiana exercitatione summi ut sint laboris efficiunt . <end>$$Moreover , even as to laboring cattle , in which the Gauls take the greatest pleasure , and which they procure at a great price , the Germans do not employ such as are imported , but those poor and ill-shaped animals , which belong to their country ; these , however , they render capable of the greatest labor by daily exercise .
<start> Equestribus proeliis saepe ex equis desiliunt ac pedibus proeliantur , equos eodem remanere vestigio adsue fecerunt , ad quos se celeriter , cum usus est , recipiunt : neque eorum moribus turpius quicquam aut inertius habetur quam ephippiis uti . <end>$$In cavalry actions they frequently leap from their horses and fight on foot ; and train their horses to stand still in the very spot on which they leave them , to which they retreat with great activity when there is occasion ; nor , according to their practice , is any thing regarded as more unseemly , or more unmanly , than to use housings .
<start> Itaque ad quemvis numerum ephippiatorum equitum quamvis pauci adire audent . <end>$$Accordingly , they have the courage , though they be themselves but few , to advance against any number whatever of horse mounted with housings .
<start> Vinum omnino ad se importari non patiuntur , quod ea re ad laborem ferendum remollescere homines atque effeminari arbitrantur . <end>$$They on no account permit wine to be imported to them , because they consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring fatigue , and are rendered effeminate by that commodity .
<start> Publice maximam putant esse laudem quam latissime a suis finibus vacare agros : hac re significari magnum numerum civitatum suam vim sustinere non posse Itaque una ex parte a Suebis circiter milia passuum C agri vacare dicuntur . <end>$$They esteem it their greatest praise as a nation , that the lands about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent , inasmuch as that by this circumstance is indicated , that a great number of nations can not withstand their power ; and thus on one side of the Suevi the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred miles .
<start> Ad alteram partem succedunt Ubii , quorum fuit civitas ampla atque florens , ut est captus Germanorum ; ii paulo , quamquam sunt eiusdem generis , sunt ceteris humaniores , propterea quod Rhenum attingunt multum ad eos mercatores ventitant et ipsi propter propinquitatem Gallicis sunt moribus adsuefacti . <end>$$On the other side they border on the Ubii , whose state was large and flourishing , considering the condition of the Germans , and who are somewhat more refined than those of the same race and the rest , and that because they border on the Rhine , and are much resorted to by merchants , and are accustomed to the manners of the Gauls , by reason of their approximity to them .
<start> Hos cum Suebi multis saepe bellis experti propter amplitudinem gravitatem civitatis finibus expellere non potuissent , tamen vectigales sibi fecerunt ac multo humiliores infirmiores redegerunt . <end>$$Though the Suevi , after making the attempt frequently and in several wars , could not expel this nation from their territories , on account of the extent and population of their state , yet they made them tributaries , and rendered them less distinguished and powerful  .
<start> In eadem causa fuerunt Usipetes et Tencteri , quos supra diximus ; qui complures annos Sueborum vim sustinuerunt , ad extremum tamen agris expulsi et multis locis Germaniae triennium vagati ad Rhenum pervenerunt , quas regiones Menapii incolebant . <end>$$In the same condition were the Usipetes and the Tencteri , who , for many years , resisted the power of the Suevi , but being at last driven from their possessions , and having wandered through many parts of Germany , came to the Rhine , to districts which the Menapii inhabited , and where they had lands , houses , and villages on either side of the river .
<start> Hi ad utramque ripam fluminis agros , aedificia vicosque habebant ; sed tantae multitudinis adventu perterriti ex iis aedificiis quae trans flumen habuerant demigraverant , et cis Rhenum dispositis praesidiis Germanos transire prohibebant . <end>$$The latter people , alarmed by the arrival of so great a multitude , removed from those houses which they had on the other side of the river , and having placed guards on this side the Rhine , proceeded to hinder the Germans from crossing .
<start> Illi omnia experti , cum neque vi contendere propter inopiam navium neque clam transire propter custodias Menapiorum possent , reverti se in suas sedes regiones simulaverunt et tridui viam progressi rursus reverterunt atque omni hoc itinere una nocte equitatu confecto inscios inopinantes Menapios oppresserunt , qui de Germanorum discessu per exploratores certiores facti sine metu trans Rhenum in suos vicos remigraverant . <end>$$They , finding themselves , after they had tried all means , unable either to force a passage on account of their deficiency in shipping , or cross by stealth on account of the guards of the Menapii , pretended to return to their own settlements and districts ; and , after having proceeded three days' march , returned ; and their cavalry having performed the whole of this journey in one night , cut off the Menapii , who were ignorant of , and did not expect who , having moreover been informed of the departure of the Germans by their scouts , had , without apprehension , returned to their villages beyond the Rhine .
<start> His interfectis navibus eorum occupatis , prius quam ea pars Menapiorum quae citra Rhenum erat certior fieret , flumen transierunt atque omnibus eorum aedificiis occupatis reliquam partem hiemis se eorum copiis aluerunt . <end>$$Having slain these , and seized their ships , they crossed the river before that part of the Menapii , who were at peace in their settlements over the Rhine , were apprized of ; and seizing all their houses , maintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the winter .
<start> His de rebus Caesar certior factus et infirmitatem Gallorum veritus , quod sunt in consiliis capiendis mobiles et novis plerumque rebus student , nihil his committendum existimavit Est enim hoc Gallicae consuetudinis , uti et viatores etiam invitos consistere cogant et quid quisque eorum de quaque re audierit aut cognoverit quaerant et mercatores in oppidis vulgus circumsistat quibus ex regionibus veniant quas ibi res cognoverint pronuntiare cogat . <end>$$Caesar , when informed of these matters , fearing the fickle disposition of the Gauls , who are easily prompted to take up resolutions , and much addicted to change , considered that nothing was to be intrusted to them ; for it is the custom of that people to compel travelers to stop , even against their inclination , and inquire what they may have heard , or may know , respecting any matter ; and in towns the common people throng around merchants and force them to state from what countries they come , and what affairs they know of there .
<start> His rebus atque auditionibus permoti de summis saepe rebus consula ineunt , quorum eos in vestigio paenitere necesse est , cum incertis rumoribus serviant et pleri ad voluntatem eorum ficta respondeant . <end>$$They often engage in resolutions concerning the most important matters , induced by these reports and stories alone ; of which they must necessarily instantly repent , since they yield to mere unauthorized reports ; and since most people give to their questions answers framed agreeably to their wishes .
<start> Qua consuetudine cognita Caesar , ne graviori bello , occurreret , maturius quam consuerat ad exercitum proficiscitur . <end>$$Caesar , being aware of their custom , in order that he might not encounter a more formidable war , sets forward to the army earlier in the year than he was accustomed to do .
<start> Eo cum venisset , ea quae fore suspicatus erat facta cognovit : missas legationes ab non nullis civitatibus ad Germanos invitatos eos uti ab Rheno discederent : omnia quae postulassent ab se fore parata . <end>$$When he had arrived there , he discovered that those things , which he had suspected would occur , had taken place ; that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the states , and that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine , and had been promised that all things which they desired should be provided by the Gauls .
<start> Qua spe adducti Germani latius iam vagabantur et in fines Eburonum et Condrusorum , qui sunt Treverorum clientes , pervenerant . <end>$$Allured by this hope , the Germans were then making excursions to greater distances , and had advanced to the territories of the Eburones and the Condrusi , who are under the protection of the Treveri .
<start> Principibus Galliae evocatis Caesar ea quae cognoverat dissimulanda sibi existimavit , eorumque animis permulsis et confirmatis equitatu imperato bellum cum Germanis gerere constituit . <end>$$After summoning the chiefs of Gaul , Caesar thought proper to pretend ignorance of the things which he had discovered ; and having conciliated and confirmed their minds , and ordered some cavalry to be raised , resolved to make war against the Germans .
<start> Re frumentaria comparata equitibusque delectis iter in ea loca facere coepit , quibus in locis esse Germanos audiebat . <end>$$Having provided corn and selected his cavalry , he began to direct his march toward those parts in which he heard the Germans were .
<start> A quibus cum paucorum dierum iter abesset , legati ab iis venerunt , quorum haec fuit oratio : Germanos neque priores populo Romano bellum inferre neque tamen recusare , si lacessantur , quin armis contendant , quod Germanorum consuetudo sit a maioribus tradita , quicumque bellum inferant , resistere neque deprecari . <end>$$When he was distant from them only a few days' march , ambassadors came to him from their state , whose speech was as follows : That the Germans neither make war upon the Roman people first , nor do they decline , if they are provoked , to engage with them in arms ; for that this was the custom of the Germans handed down to them from their forefathers , —to resist whatsoever people make war upon them and not to avert it by entreaty ; this , however , they confessed , —that they had come hither reluctantly , having been expelled from their country .
<start> Haec tamen dicere venisse invitos , eiectos domo ; si suam gratiam Romani velint , posse iis utiles esse amicos ; vel sibi agros attribuant vel patiantur eos tenere quos armis possederint : sese unis Suebis concedere , quibus ne di quidem immortales pares esse possint ; reliquum quidem in terris esse neminem quem non superare possint . <end>$$If the Romans were disposed to accept their friendship , they might be serviceable allies to them ; and let them either assign them lands , or permit them to retain those which they had acquired by their arms ; that they are inferior to the Suevi alone , to whom not even the immortal gods can show themselves equal ; that there was none at all besides on earth whom they could not conquer .
<start> Ad haec Caesar quae visum est respondit ; sed exitus fuit orationis : sibi nullam cum iis amicitiam esse posse , si in Gallia remanerent ; neque verum esse , qui suos fines tueri non potuerint alienos occupare ; neque ullos in Gallia vacare agros qui dari tantae praesertim multitudini sine iniuria possint ; sed licere , si velint , in Ubiorum finibus considere , quorum sint legati apud se et de Sueborum iniuriis querantur et a se auxilium petant : hoc se Ubiis imperaturus . <end>$$To these remarks Caesar replied in such terms as he thought proper ; but the conclusion of his speech was , That he could make no alliance with them , if they continued in Gaul ; that it was not probable that they who were not able to defend their own territories , should get possession of those of others , nor were there any lands lying waste in Gaul , which could be given away , especially to so great a number of men , without doing wrong ; but they might , if they were desirous , settle in the territories of the Ubii ; whose ambassadors were then with him , and were complaining of the aggressions of the Suevi , and requesting assistance from him ; and that he would obtain this request from them .
<start> Legati haec se ad suos relaturos dixerunt et re deliberata post diem tertium ad Caesarem reversuros : interea ne propius se castra moveret petierunt . <end>$$The embassadors said that they would report these things to their country men ; and , after having deliberated on the matter , would return to Caesar after the third day , they begged that he would not in the mean time advance his camp nearer to them .
<start> Cognoverat enim magnam partem equitatus ab iis aliquot diebus ante praedandi frumentandi causa ad Ambivaritos trans Mosam missam : hos expectari equites atque eius rei causa moram interponi arbitrabatur . <end>$$He supposed that they were then waiting for these horse , and that the delay was caused on this account .
<start> Caesar cum ab hoste non amplius passuum XII : milibus abesset , ut erat constitutum , ad eum legati revertuntur ; qui in itinere congressi magnopere ne longius progrederetur orabant . <end>$$When Caesar was not more than twelve miles distant from the enemy , the ambassadors return to him , as had been arranged ; who meeting him on the march , earnestly entreated him not to advance any further .
<start> Cum id non impetrassent , petebant uti ad eos qui agmen antecessissent praemitteret eos pugna prohiberet , sibique ut potestatem faceret in Ubios legatos mittendi ; quorum si principes ac senatus sibi iure iurando fidem fecisset , ea condicione quae a Caesare ferretur se usuros ostendebant : ad has res conficiendas sibi tridui spatium daret . <end>$$When they could not obtain this , they begged him to send on a dispatch to those who had marched in advance of the main army , and forbid them to engage ; and grant them permission to send embassadors to the Ubii , and if the princes and senate of the latter would give them security by oath , they assured Caesar that they would accept such conditions as might be proposed by him ; and requested that he would give them the space of three days for negotiating these affairs .
<start> Haec omnia Caesar eodem illo pertinere arbitrabatur ut tridui mora interposita equites eorum qui abessent reverterentur ; tamen sese non longius milibus passuum IIII aquationis causa processurum eo die dixit : huc postero die quam frequentissimi convenirent , ut de eorum postulatis cognosceret . <end>$$Caesar thought that these things tended to the self-same point ; that , in consequence of a delay of three days intervening , their horse , which were at a distance , might return ; however , he said , that he would not that day advance further than four miles for the purpose of procuring water ; he ordered that they should assemble at that place in as large a number as possible , the following day , that he might inquire into their demands .
<start> Interim ad praefectos , qui cum omni equitatu antecesserant , mittit qui nuntiarent ne hostes proelio lacesserent , et si ipsi lacesserentur , sustinerent quoad ipse cum exercitu propius accessisset . <end>$$In the mean time he sends messengers to the officers who had marched in advance with all the cavalry , to order them not to provoke the enemy to an engagement , and if they themselves were assailed , to sustain the attack until he came up with the army .
<start> At hostes , ubi primum nostros equites conspexerunt , quorum erat V milium numerus , cum ipsi non amplius DCCC equites haberent , quod ii qui frumentandi causa erant trans Mosam profecti nondum redierant , nihil timentibus nostris , quod legati eorum paulo ante a Caesare discesserant atque is dies indutiis erat ab his petitus , impetu facto celeriter nostros perturbaverunt ; rursus his resistentibus consuetudine sua ad pedes desiluerunt subfossis equis compluribus nostris deiectis reliquos in fugam coniecerunt atque ita perterritos egerunt ut non prius fuga desisterent quam in conspectum agminis nostri venissent . <end>$$But the enemy , as soon as they saw our horse , the number of which was 5000 , whereas they themselves had not more than 800 horse , because those which had gone over the Meuse for the purpose of foraging had not returned , while our men had no apprehensions , because their embassadors had gone away from Caesar a little before , and that day had been requested by them as a period of truce , made an onset on our men , and soon threw them into disorder .
<start> In eo proelio ex equitibus nostris interficiuntur IIII et LXX , in his vir fortissimus Piso Aquitanus , amplissimo genere natus , cuius avus in civitate sua regnum obtinuerat amicus a senatu nostro appellatus . <end>$$In that encounter seventy-four of our horse were slain ; among them , Piso , an Aquitanian , a most valiant man , and descended from a very illustrious family ; whose grandfather had held the sovereignty of his state , and had been styled friend by our senate .
<start> Hic cum fratri intercluso ab hostibus auxilium ferret , illum ex periculo eripuit , ipse equo vulnerato deiectus , quoad potuit , fortissime restitit ; cum circumventus multis vulneribus acceptis cecidisset atque id frater , qui iam proelio excesserat , procul animadvertisset , incitato equo se hostibus obtulit atque interfectus est . <end>$$When at length he fell , surrounded on all sides and after receiving many wounds , and his brother , who had then retired from the fight , observed it from a distance , he spurred on his horse , threw himself upon the enemy , and was killed .
<start> Hoc facto proelio Caesar neque iam sibi legatos audiendos neque condiciones accipiendas arbitrabatur ab iis qui per dolum atque insidias petita pace ultro bellum intulissent ; expectare vero dum hostium copiae augerentur equitatus reverteretur summae dementiae esse iudicabat , et cognita Gallorum infirmitate quantum iam apud eos hostes uno proelio auctoritatis essent consecuti sentiebat ; quibus ad consilia capienda nihil spatii dandum existimabat . <end>$$After this engagement , Caesar considered that neither ought embassadors to be received to audience , nor conditions be accepted by him from those who , after having sued for peace by way of stratagem and treachery , had made war without provocation .
<start> His constitutis rebus et consilio cum legatis et quaestore communicato , ne quem diem pugnae praetermitteret , oportunissima res accidit , quod postridie eius diei mane eadem et perfidia et simulatione usi Germani frequentes , omnibus principibus maioribusque natu adhibitis , ad eum in castra venerunt , simul , ut dicebatur , sui purgandi causa , quod contra atque esset dictum et ipsi petissent , proelium pridie commisissent , simul ut , si quid possent , de indutiis fallendo impetrarent . <end>$$And to wait until the enemy's forces were augmented and their cavalry had returned , he concluded , would be the greatest madness ; and knowing the fickleness of the Gauls , he felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired among them by this one skirmish .
<start> Acie triplici instituta et celeriter VIII milium itinere confecto , prius ad hostium castra pervenit quam quid ageretur Germani sentire possent Qui omnibus rebus subito perterriti et celeritate adventus nostri et discessu suorum , neque consilii habendi neque arma capiendi spatio dato perturbantur , copiasne adversus hostem ducere an castra defendere an fuga salutem petere praestaret . <end>$$Having marshalled his army in three lines , and in a short time performed a march of eight miles , he arrived at the camp of the enemy before the Germans could perceive what was going on ; who being suddenly alarmed by all the circumstances , both by the speediness of our arrival and the absence of their own officers , as time was afforded neither for concerting measures nor for seizing their arms , are perplexed as to whether it would be better to lead out their forces against the enemy , or to defend their camp , or seek their safety by flight .
<start> Quorum timor cum fremitu et concursu significaretur , milites nostri pristini diei perfidia incitati in castra inruperunt Quo loco qui celeriter arma capere potuerunt paulisper nostris restiterunt atque inter carros impedimenta proelium commiserunt ; at reliqua multitudo puerorum mulierum (nam cum omnibus suis domo excesserant Rhenum transierant) passim fugere coepit , ad quos consectandos Caesar equitatum misit . <end>$$Their consternation being made apparent by their noise and tumult , our soldiers , excited by the treachery of the preceding day , rushed into the camp : such of them as could readily get their arms , for a short time withstood our men , and gave battle among their carts and baggage wagons ; but the rest of the people , of boys and women began to fly in all directions ; in pursuit of whom Caesar sent the cavalry .
<start> Germani post tergum clamore audito , eum suos interfiei viderent , armis abiectis signis militaribus relictis se ex castris eiecerunt , et eum ad confluentem Mosae et Rheni pervenissent , reliqua fuga desperata , magno numero interfecto , reliqui se in flumen praecipitaverunt atque ibi timore , lassitudine , vi fluminis oppressi perierunt . <end>$$The Germans when , upon hearing a noise behind them , saw that their families were being slain , throwing away their arms and abandoning their standards , fled out of the camp , and when they had arrived at the confluence of the Meuse and the Rhine , the survivors despairing of further escape , as a great number of their countrymen had been killed , threw themselves into the river and there perished , overcome by fear , fatigue , and the violence of the stream .
<start> Nostri ad unum omnes incolumes , perpaucis vulneratis , ex tanti belli timore , cum hostium numerus capitum CCCCXXX milium fuisset , se in castra receperunt . <end>$$Our soldiers , after the alarm of so great a war , for the number of the enemy amounted to 430 , 000 , returned to their camp , all safe to a man , very few being even wounded .
<start> Caesar iis quos in castris retinuerat discedendi potestatem fecit . <end>$$Caesar granted those whom he had detained in the camp liberty of departing .
<start> Illi supplicia cruciatusque Gallorum veriti , quorum agros vexaverant , remanere se apud eum velle dixerunt . <end>$$They however , dreading revenge and torture from the Gauls , whose lands they had harassed , said that they desired to remain with him .
<start> His Caesar libertatem concessit . <end>$$Caesar granted them permission .
<start> Germanico bello confecto multis de causis Caesar statuit sibi Rhenum esse transeundum ; quarum illa fuit iustissima quod , cum videret Germanos tam facile impelli ut in Galliam venirent , suis quoque rebus eos timere voluit , cum intellegerent et posse et audere populi Romani exercitum Rhenum transire . <end>$$The German war being finished , Caesar thought it expedient for him to cross the Rhine , for many reasons ; of which this was the most weighty , that , since he saw the Germans were so easily urged to go into Gaul , he desired they should have their fears for their own territories , when they discovered that the army of the Roman people both could and dared pass the Rhine .
<start> Accessit etiam quod illa pars equitatus Usipetum et Tencterorum , quam supra commemoravi praedandi frumentandi causa Mosam transisse neque proelio interfuisse , post fugam suorum se trans Rhenum in fines Sugambrorum receperat seque cum his coniunxerat . <end>$$There was added also , that portion of the cavalry of the Usipetes and the Tencteri , which I have above related to have crossed the Meuse for the purpose of plundering and procuring forage , and was not present at the engagement , had betaken themselves , after the retreat of their countrymen , across the Rhine into the territories of the Sugambri , and united themselves to them .
<start> Ad quos cum Caesar nuntios misisset , qui postularent eos qui sibi Galliae bellum intulissent sibi dederent , responderunt : populi Romani imperium Rhenum finire ; si se invito Germanos in Galliam transire non aequum existimaret , cur sui quicquam esse imperii aut potestatis trans Rhenum postularet ? Ubii autem , qui uni ex Transrhenanis ad Caesarem legatos miserant , amicitiam fecerant , obsides dederant , magnopere orabant ut sibi auxilium ferret , quod graviter ab Suebis premerentur ; vel , si id facere occupationibus rei publicae prohiberetur , exercitum modo Rhenum transportaret : id sibi ad auxilium spemque reliqui temporis satis futurum . <end>$$When Caesar sent embassadors to them , to demand that they should give up to him those who had made war against him and against Gaul , they replied , That the Rhine bounded the empire of the Roman people ; if he did not think it just for the Germans to pass over into Gaul against his consent , why did he claim that any thing beyond the Rhine should be subject to his dominion or power ? The Ubii , also , who alone , out of all the nations lying beyond the Rhine , had sent embassadors to Caesar , and formed an alliance and given hostages , earnestly entreated that he would bring them assistance , because they were grievously oppressed by the Suevi ; or , if he was prevented from doing so by the business of the commonwealth , he would at least transport his army over the Rhine ; that that would be sufficient for their present assistance and their hope for the future ; that so great was the name and the reputation of his army , even among the most remote nations of the Germans , arising from the defeat of Ariovistus and this last battle which was fought , that they might be safe under the fame and friendship of the Roman people .
<start> Caesar his de causis quas commemoravi Rhenum transire decrevat ; sed navibus transire neque satis tutum esse arbitrabatur neque suae neque populi Romani dignitatis esse statuebat . <end>$$Caesar , for those reasons which I have mentioned , had resolved to cross the Rhine ; but to cross by ships he neither deemed to be sufficiently safe , nor considered consistent with his own dignity or that of the Roman people .
<start> Itaque , etsi summa difficultas faciendi pontis proponebatur propter latitudinem , rapiditatem altitudinemque fluminis , tamen id sibi contendendum aut aliter non traducendum exercitum existimabat . <end>$$Therefore , although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him , on account of the breadth , rapidity , and depth of the river , he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted by him , or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over .
<start> Rationem pontis hanc instituit . <end>$$He devised this plan of a bridge .
<start> Tigna bina sesquipedalia paulum ab imo praeacuta dimensa ad altitudinem fluminis intervallo pedum duorum inter se iungebat . <end>$$He joined together at the distance of two feet , two piles , each a foot and a half thick , sharpened a little at the lower end , and proportioned in length , to the depth of the river .
<start> Haec cum machinationibus immissa in flumen defixerat fistucisque adegerat , non sublicae modo derecte ad perpendiculum , sed prone ac fastigate , ut secundum naturam fluminis procumberent , iis item contraria duo ad eundem modum iuncta intervallo pedum quadragenum ab inferiore parte contra vim atque impetu fluminis conversa statuebat . <end>$$After he had , by means of engines , sunk these into the river , and fixed them at the bottom , and then driven them in with rammers , not quite perpendicularly , dike a stake , but bending forward and sloping , so as to incline in the direction of the current of the river ; he also placed two opposite to these , at the distance of forty feet lower down , fastened together in the same manner , but directed against the force and current of the river .
<start> Haec utraque insuper bipedalibus trabibus immissis , quantum eorum tignorum iunctura distabat , binis utrimque fibulis ab extrema parte distinebantur ; quibus disclusis atque in contrariam partem revinctis , tanta erat operis firmitudo atque ea rerum natura ut , quo maior vis aquae se incitavisset , hoc artius inligata tenerentur . <end>$$Both these , moreover , were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick , laid in at their extremities between two braces on each side , and in consequence of these being in different directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other , so great was the strength of the work , and such the arrangement of the materials , that in proportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge , so much the closer were its parts held fastened together .
<start> Haec derecta materia iniecta contexebantur ac longuriis cratibusque consternebantur ; ac nihilo setius sublicae et ad inferiorem partem fluminis oblique agebantur , quae pro ariete subiectae et cum omni opere coniunctae vim fluminis exciperent , et aliae item supra pontem mediocri spatio , ut , si arborum trunci sive naves deiciendi operis causa essent a barbaris missae , his defensoribus earum rerum vis minueretur neu ponti nocerent . <end>$$These beams were bound together by timber laid over them , in the direction of the length of the bridge , and were covered over with laths and hurdles ; and in addition to this , piles were driven into the water obliquely , at the lower side of the bridge , and these , serving as buttresses , and being connected with every portion of the work , sustained the force of the stream : and there were others also above the bridge , at a moderate distance ; that if trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the river by the barbarians for the purpose of destroying the work , the violence of such things might be diminished by these defenses , and might not injure the bridge .
<start> Diebus X , quibus materia coepta erat comportari , omni opere effecto exercitus traducitur . <end>$$Within ten days after the timber began to be collected , the whole work was completed , and the whole army led over .
<start> Caesar ad utramque partem pontis firmo praesidio relicto in fines Sugambrorum contendit . <end>$$Caesar , leaving a strong guard at each end of the bridge , hastens into the territories of the Sugambri .
<start> Interim a compluribus civitatibus ad eum legati veniunt ; quibus pacem atque amicitiam petentibus liberaliter respondet obsidesque ad se adduci iubet . <end>$$In the mean time , embassadors from several nations come to him , whom , on their suing for peace and alliance , he answers in a courteous manner , and orders hostages to be brought to him .
<start> At Sugambri , ex eo tempore quo pons institui coeptus est fuga comparata , hortantibus iis quos ex Tencteris atque Usipetibus apud se habebant , finibus suis excesserant suaque omnia exportaverant seque in solitudinem ac silvas abdiderant . <end>$$But the Sugambri , at the very time the bridge was begun to be built , made preparations for a flight , and quitted their territories , and conveyed away all their possessions , and concealed themselves in deserts and woods .
<start> Caesar paucos dies in eorum finibus moratus , omnibus vicis aedificiisque incensis frumentisque succisis , se in fines Ubiorum recepit atque his auxilium suum pollicitus , si a Suebis premerentur , haec ab iis cognovit : Suebos , postea quam per exploratores pontem fieri comperissent , more suo concilio habito nuntios in omnes partes dimisisse , uti de oppidis demigrarent , liberos , uxores suaque omnia in silvis deponerent atque omnes qui arma ferre possent unum in locum convenirent . <end>$$Caesar , having remained in their territories a few days , and burned all their villages and houses , and cut down their corn , proceeded into the territories of the Ubii ; and having promised them his assistance , if they were ever harassed by the Suevi , he learned from them these particulars : that the Suevi , after they had by means of their scouts found that the bridge was being built , had called a council , according to their custom , and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the towns and convey their children , wives , and all their possessions into the woods , and that all who could bear arms should assemble in one place ; that the place thus chosen was nearly the centre of those regions which the Suevi possessed ; that in this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of the Romans , and give them battle there .
<start> Hunc esse delectum medium fere regionum earum quas Suebi obtinerent ; hic Romanorum adventum expectare atque ibi decertare constituisse Quod ubi Caesar comperit , omnibus iis rebus confectis , quarum rerum causa exercitum traducere constituerat , ut Germanis metum iniceret , ut Sugambros ulcisceretur , ut Ubios obsidione liberaret , diebus omnino XVIII trans Rhenum consumptis , satis et ad laudem et ad utilitatem profectum arbitratus se in Galliam recepit pontemque rescidit . <end>$$When Caesar discovered this , having already accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved to lead his army over , namely , to strike fear into the Germans , take vengeance on the Sugambri , and free the Ubii from the invasion of the Suevi , having spent altogether eighteen days beyond the Rhine , and thinking he had advanced far enough to serve both honor and interest , he returned into Gaul , and cut down the bridge .
<start> Exigua parte aestatis reliqua Caesar , etsi in his locis , quod omnis Gallia ad septentriones vergit , maturae sunt hiemes , tamen in Britanniam proficisci contendit , quod omnibus fere Gallicis bellis hostibus nostris inde subministrata auxilia intellegebat , et si tempus anni ad bellum gerendum deficeret , tamen magno sibi usui fore arbitrabatur , si modo insulam adiisset , genus hominum perspexisset , loca , portus , aditus cognovisset ; quae omnia fere Gallis erant incognita . <end>$$During the short part of summer which remained , Caesar , although in these countries , as all Gaul lies toward the north , the winters are early , nevertheless resolved to proceed into Britain , because he discovered that in almost all the wars with the Gauls succors had been furnished to our enemy from that country ; and even if the time of year should be insufficient for carrying on the war , yet he thought it would be of great service to him if he only entered the island , and saw into the character of the people , and got knowledge of their localities , harbors , and landing-places , all which were for the most part unknown to the Gauls .
<start> Neque enim temere praeter mercatores illo adit quisquam , neque his ipsis quicquam praeter oram maritimam atque eas regiones quae sunt contra Galliam notum est . <end>$$For neither does any one except merchants generally go thither , nor even to them was any portion of it known , except the sea-coast and those parts which are opposite to Gaul .
<start> Itaque vocatis ad se undique mercatoribus , neque quanta esset insulae magnitudo neque quae aut quantae nationes incolerent , neque quem usum belli haberent aut quibus institutis uterentur , neque qui essent ad maiorem navium multitudinem idonei portus reperire poterat . <end>$$Therefore , after having called up to him the merchants from all parts , he could learn neither what was the size of the island , nor what or how numerous were the nations which inhabited it , nor what system of war they followed , nor what customs they used , nor what harbors were convenient for a great number of large ships .
<start> Ad haec cognoscenda , prius quam periculum faceret , idoneum esse arbitratus Gaius Volusenum cum navi longa praemittit . <end>$$He sends before him Gaius Volusenus with a ship of war , to acquire a knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a descent into the island , as he was convinced that this was a judicious measure .
<start> Huic mandat ut exploratis omnibus rebus ad se quam primum revertatur . <end>$$He commissioned him to thoroughly examine into all matters , and then return to him as soon as possible .
<start> Ipse cum omnibus copiis in Morinos proficiscitur , quod inde erat brevissimus in Britanniam traiectus . <end>$$He himself proceeds to the Morini with all his forces .
<start> Huc naves undique ex finitimis regionibus et quam superiore aestate ad Veneticum bellum fecerat classem iubet convenire . <end>$$He orders ships from all parts of the neighboring countries , and the fleet which the preceding summer he had built for the war with the Veneti , to assemble in this place .
<start> Interim , consilio eius cognito et per mercatores perlato ad Britannos , a compluribus insulae civitatibus ad eum legati veniunt , qui polliceantur obsides dare atque imperio populi Romani obtemperare . <end>$$In the mean time , his purpose having been discovered , and reported to the Britons by merchants , embassadors come to him from several states of the island , to promise that they will give hostages , and submit to the government of the Roman people .
<start> Quibus auditis , liberaliter pollicitus hortatusque ut in ea sententia permanerent , eos domum remittit et cum iis una Commium , quem ipse Atrebatibus superatis regem ibi constituerat , cuius et virtutem et consilium probabat et quem sibi fidelem esse arbitrabatur cuiusque auctoritas in his regionibus magni habebatur , mittit . <end>$$Having given them an audience , he after promising liberally , and exhorting them to continue in that purpose , sends them back to their own country , and with them Commius , whom , upon subduing the Atrebates , he had created king there , a man whose courage and conduct he esteemed , and who he thought would be faithful to him , and whose influence ranked highly in those countries .
<start> Huic imperat quas possit adeat civitates horteturque ut populi Romani fidem sequantur seque celeriter eo venturum nuntiet . <end>$$He orders him to visit as many states as he could , and persuade them to embrace the protection of the Roman people , and apprize them that he would shortly come thither .
<start> Volusenus perspectis regionibus omnibus quantum ei facultatis dari potuit , qui navi egredi ac se barbaris committere non auderet , V die ad Caesarem revertitur quaeque ibi perspexisset renuntiat . <end>$$Volusenus , having viewed the localities as far as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship and trust himself to barbarians , returns to Caesar on the fifth day , and reports what he had there observed .
<start> Dum in his locis Caesar navium parandarum causa moratur , ex magna parte Morinorum ad eum legati venerunt , qui se de superioris temporis consilio excusarent , quod homines barbari et nostrae consuetudinis imperiti bellum populo Romano fecissent , seque ea quae imperasset facturos pollicerentur . <end>$$While Caesar remains in these parts for the purpose of procuring ships , embassadors come to him from a great portion of the Morini , to plead their excuse respecting their conduct on the late occasion ; alleging that it was as men uncivilized , and as those who were unacquainted with our custom , that they had made war upon the Roman people , and promising to perform what he should command .
<start> Hoc sibi Caesar satis oportune accidisse arbitratus , quod neque post tergum hostem relinquere volebat neque belli gerendi propter anni tempus facultatem habebat neque has tantularum rerum occupationes Britanniae anteponendas iudicabat , magnum iis numerum obsidum imperat . <end>$$Caesar , thinking that this had happened fortunately enough for him , because he neither wished to leave an enemy behind him , nor had an opportunity for carrying on a war , by reason of the time of year , nor considered that employment in such trifling matters was to be preferred to his enterprise on Britain , imposes a large number of hostages ; and when these were brought , he received them to his protection .
<start> Quibus adductis eos in fidem recipit Navibus circiter LXXX onerariis coactis contractisque , quot satis esse ad duas transportandas legiones existimabat , quod praeterea navium longarum habebat quaestori , legatis praefectisque distribuit . <end>$$Having collected together , and provided about eighty transport ships , as many as he thought necessary for conveying over two legions , he assigned such of war as he had besides to the quaestor , his legates , and officers of cavalry .
<start> Huc accedebant XVIII onerariae naves , quae ex eo loco a milibus passuum VIII vento tenebantur quo minus in eundem portum venire possent : has equitibus tribuit . <end>$$There were in addition to these eighteen ships of burden which were prevented , eight miles from that place , by winds , from being able to reach the same port .
<start> Reliquum exercitum Quintus Titurio Sabino et Lucius Aurunculeio Cottae legatis in Menapios atque in eos pagos Morinorum a quibus ad eum legati non venerant ducendum dedit . <end>$$These he distributed among the horse ; the rest of the army , he delivered to Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta , his legates , to lead into the territories of the Menapii and those cantons of the Morini from which embassadors had not come to him .
<start> Publius Sulpicium Rufum legatum cum eo praesidio quod satis esse arbitrabatur portum tenere iussit . <end>$$He ordered Publius Sulpicius Rufus , his legate , to hold possession of the harbor , with such a garrison as he thought sufficient .
<start> His constitutis rebus , nactus idoneam ad navigandum tempestatem III fere vigilia solvit equitesque in ulteriorem portum progredi et naves conscendere et se sequi iussit . <end>$$These matters being arranged , finding the weather favorable for his voyage , he set sail about the third watch , and ordered the horse to march forward to the further port , and there embark and follow him .
<start> A quibus cum paulo tardius esset administratum , ipse hora diei circiter IIII cum primis navibus Britanniam attigit atque ibi in omnibus collibus expositas hostium copias armatas conspexit . <end>$$As this was performed rather tardily by them , he himself reached Britain with the first squadron of ships , about the fourth hour of the day , and there saw the forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills .
<start> Cuius loci haec erat natura atque ita montibus angustis mare continebatur , uti ex locis superioribus in litus telum adigi posset . <end>$$The nature of the place was this : the sea was confined by mountains so close to it that a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore .
<start> Hunc ad egrediendum nequaquam idoneum locum arbitratus , dum reliquae naves eo convenirent ad horam nonam in ancoris expectavit . <end>$$Considering this by no means a fit place for disembarking , he remained at anchor till the ninth hour , for the other ships to arrive there .
<start> Interim legatis tribunisque militum convocatis et quae ex Voluseno cognovisset et quae fieri vellet ostendit monuitque , ut rei militaris ratio , maximeque ut maritimae res postularent , ut , cum celerem atque instabilem motum haberent , ad nutum et ad tempus D omnes res ab iis administrarentur . <end>$$Having in the mean time assembled the legates and military tribunes , he told them both what he had learned from Volusenus , and what he wished to be done ; and enjoined them that all things should be performed by them at a nod and at the instant .
<start> At barbari , consilio Romanorum cognito praemisso equitatu et essedariis , quo plerumque genere in proeliis uti consuerunt , reliquis copiis subsecuti nostros navibus egredi prohibebant . <end>$$But the barbarians , upon perceiving the design of the Romans , sent forward their cavalry and charioteers , a class of warriors of whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles , and following with the rest of their forces , endeavored to prevent our men landing .
<start> Erat ob has causas summa difficultas , quod naves propter magnitudinem nisi in alto constitui non poterant , militibus autem , ignotis locis , impeditis manibus , magno et gravi onere armorum oppressis simul et de navibus desiliendum et in auctibus consistendum et cum hostibus erat pugnandum , cum illi aut ex arido aut paulum in aquam progressi omnibus membris expeditis , notissimis locis , audacter tela coicerent et equos insuefactos incitarent . <end>$$In this was the greatest difficulty , for the following reasons , namely , because our ships , on account of their great size , could be stationed only in deep water ; and our soldiers , in places unknown to them , with their hands embarrassed , oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor , had at the same time to leap from the ships , stand amid the waves , and encounter the enemy ; whereas they , either on dry ground , or advancing a little way into the water , free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known to them , could confidently throw their weapons and spur on their horses , which were accustomed to this kind of service .
<start> Quibus rebus nostri perterriti atque huius omnino generis pugnae imperiti , non eadem alacritate ac studio quo in pedestribus uti proeliis consuerant utebantur . <end>$$Dismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode of battle , our men did not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which they had been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground .
<start> Quod ubi Caesar animadvertit , naves longas , quarum et species erat barbaris inusitatior et motus ad usum expeditior , paulum removeri ab onerariis navibus et remis incitari et ad latus apertum hostium constitui atque inde fundis , sagittis , tormentis hostes propelli ac submoveri iussit ; quae res magno usui nostris fuit . <end>$$When Caesar observed this , he ordered the ships of war , the appearance of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the motion more ready for service , to be withdrawn a little from the transport vessels , and to be propelled by their oars , and be stationed toward the open flank of the enemy , and the enemy to be beaten off and driven away , with slings , arrows , and engines : which plan was of great service to our men ; for the barbarians being startled by the form of our ships and the motions of our oars and the nature of our engines , which was strange to them , stopped , and shortly after retreated a little .
<start> ' Hoc cum voce magna dixisset , se ex navi proiecit atque in hostes aquilam ferre coepit . <end>$$When he had said this with a loud voice , he leaped from the ship and proceeded to bear the eagle toward the enemy .
<start> Tum nostri cohortati inter se , ne tantum dedecus admitteretur , universi ex navi desiluerunt . <end>$$Then our men , exhorting one another that so great a disgrace should not be incurred , all leaped from the ship .
<start> Hos item ex proximis primi navibus cum conspexissent , subsecuti hostibus adpropinquaverunt . <end>$$When those in the nearest vessels saw them , they speedily followed and approached the enemy .
<start> Pugnatum est ab utrisque acriter . <end>$$The battle was maintained vigorously on both sides .
<start> Nostri tamen , quod neque ordines servare neque firmiter insistere neque signa subsequi poterant atque alius alia ex navi quibuscumque signis occurrerat se adgregabat , magnopere perturbabantur ; hostes vero , notis omnibus vadii , ubi ex litore aliquos singulares ex navi egredientes conspexerant , incitatis equis impeditos adoriebantur , plures paucos circumsistebant , alii ab latere aperto in universos tela coiciebant . <end>$$Our men , however , as they could neither keep their ranks , nor get firm footing , nor follow their standards , and as one from one ship and another from another assembled around whatever standards they met , were thrown into great confusion .
<start> Quod cum animadvertisset Caesar , scaphas longarum navium , item speculatoria navigia militibus compleri iussit , et quos laborantes conspexerat , his subsidia submittebat . <end>$$But the enemy , who were acquainted with all the shallows , when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by one , spurred on their horses , and attacked them while embarrassed ; many surrounded a few , others threw their weapons upon our collected forces on their exposed flank .
<start> Nostri , simul in arido constiterunt , suis omnibus consecutis , in hostes impetum fecerunt atque eos in fugam dederunt ; neque longius prosequi potuerunt , quod equites cursum tenere atque insulam capere non potuerant . <end>$$When Caesar observed this , he ordered the boats of the ships of war and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers , and sent them up to the succor of those whom he had observed in distress .
<start> Hostes proelio superati , simul atque se ex fuga : receperunt , statim ad Caesarem legatos de pace miserunt ; obsides sese daturos quaeque imperasset facturos polliciti sunt . <end>$$The enemy being thus vanquished in battle , as soon as they recovered after their flight , instantly sent embassadors to Caesar to negotiate about peace .
<start> Una cum his legatis Commius Atrebas venit , quem supra demonstraveram a Caesare in Britanniam praemissum . <end>$$They promised to give hostages and perform what he should command .
<start> Hunc illi e navi egressum , cum ad eos oratoris modo Caesaris mandata deferret , comprehenderant atque in vincula coniecerant ; tum proelio facto remiserunt et in petenda pace eius rei culpam in multitudinem contulerunt et propter imprudentiam ut ignosceretur petiverunt . <end>$$Together with these embassadors came Commius the Atrebatian , who , as I have above said , had been sent by Caesar into Britain Him they had seized upon when leaving his ship , although in the character of embassador he bore the general's commission to them , and thrown into chains : then after the battle was fought , they sent him back , and in suing for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common people , and entreated that it might be pardoned on account of their indiscretion .
<start> Caesar questus quod , cum ultro in continentem legatis missis pacem ab se petissent , bellum sine causa intulissent , ignoscere se imprudentiae dixit obsidesque imperavit ; quorum illi partem statim dederunt , partem ex longinquioribus locis arcessitam paucis diebus sese daturos dixerunt . <end>$$Caesar , complaining , that after they had sued for peace , and had voluntarily sent embassadors into the continent for that purpose , they had made war without a reason , said that he would pardon their indiscretion , and imposed hostages , a part of whom they gave immediately ; the rest they said they would give in a few days , since they were sent for from remote places .
<start> Interea suos in agros remigrare iusserunt , principesque undique convenire et se civitatesque suas Caesari commendare coeperunt . <end>$$In the mean time they ordered their people to return to the country parts , and the chiefs assembled from all quarter , and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to Caesar .
<start> His rebus pace confirmata , post diem quartum quam est in Britanniam ventum naves XVIII , de quibus supra demonstratum est , quae equites sustulerant , ex superiore portu leni vento solverunt Quae cum adpropinquarent Britanniae et ex castris viderentur , tanta tempestas subito coorta est ut nulla earum cursum tenere posset , sed aliae eodem unde erant profectae referrentur , aliae ad inferiorem partem insulae , quae est propius solis occasum , magno suo cum periculo deicerentur ; quae tamen ancoris iactis cum fluctibus complerentur , necessario adversa nocte in altum provectae continentem petierunt . <end>$$A peace being established by these proceedings four days after we had come into Britain , the eighteen ships , to which reference has been made above , and which conveyed the cavalry , set sail from the upper port with a gentle gale , when , however , they were approaching Britain and were seen from the camp , so great a storm suddenly arose that none of them could maintain their course at sea ; and some were taken back to the same port from which they had started ; -others , to their great danger , were driven to the lower part of the island , nearer to the west ; which , however , after having cast anchor , as they were getting filled with water , put out to sea through necessity in a stormy night , and made for the continent .
<start> Eadem nocte accidit ut esset luna plena , qui dies maritimos aestus maximos in Oceano efficere consuevit , nostrisque id erat incognitum . <end>$$It happened that night to be full moon , which usually occasions very high tides in that ocean ; and that circumstance was unknown to our men .
<start> Ita uno tempore et longas naves , quas Caesar in aridum subduxerat , aestus complebat , et onerarias , quae ad ancoras erant deligatae , tempestas adflictabat , neque ulla nostris facultas aut administrandi , aut auxiliandi dabatur . <end>$$Thus , at the same time , the tide began to fill the ships of war which Caesar had provided to convey over his army , and which he had drawn up on the strand ; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden which were riding at anchor against each other ; nor was any means afforded our men of either managing them or of rendering any service .
<start> Compluribus navibus fractis , reliquae cum essent funibus , ancoris reliquisque armamentis amissis ad navigandum inutiles , magna , id quod necesse erat accidere , totius exercitus perturbatio facta est Neque enim naves erant aliae quibus reportari possent , et omnia deerant quae ad reficiendas naves erant usui , et , quod omnibus constabat hiemari in Gallia oportere , frumentum in his locis in hiemem provisum non erat . <end>$$A great many ships having been wrecked , inasmuch as the rest , having lost their cables , anchors , and other tackling , were unfit for sailing , a great confusion , as would necessarily happen , arose throughout the army ; for there were no other ships in which they could be conveyed back , and all things which are of service in repairing vessels were wanting , and , corn for the winter had not been provided in those places , because it was understood by all that they would certainly winter in Gaul .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis , principes Britanniae , qui post proelium ad Caesarem convenerant , inter se conlocuti , cum et equites et naves et frumentum Romanis deesse intellegerent et paucitatem militum ex castrorum exiguitate cognoscerent , quae hoc erant etiam angustior quod sine impedimentis Caesar legiones transportaverat , optimum factu esse duxerunt rebellione facta frumento commeatuque nostros prohibere et rem in hiemem producere , quod his superatis aut reditu interclusis neminem postea belli inferendi causa in Britanniam transiturum confidebant . <end>$$On discovering these things the chiefs of Britain , who had come up after the battle was fought to perform those conditions which Caesar had imposed , held a conference , when they perceived that cavalry , and ships , and corn were wanting to the Romans , and discovered the small number of our soldiers from the small extent of the camp , and thought that the best plan was to renew the war , and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract the affair till winter ; because they felt confident , that , if they were vanquished or cut off from a return , no one would afterward pass over into Britain for the purpose of making war .
<start> Itaque rursus coniuratione facta paulatim ex castris discedere et suos clam ex agris deducere coeperunt . <end>$$Therefore , again entering into a conspiracy , they began to depart from the camp by degrees and secretly bring up their people from the country parts .
<start> At Caesar , etsi nondum eorum consilia cognoverat , tamen et ex eventu navium suarum et ex eo quod obsides dare intermiserant fore id quod accidit suspicabatur . <end>$$But Caesar , although he had not as yet discovered their measures , yet , both from what had occurred to his ships , and from the circumstance that they had neglected to give the promised hostages , suspected that the thing would come to pass which really did happen .
<start> Itaque ad omnes casus subsidia comparabat Nam et frumentum ex agris cotidie in castra conferebat et , quae gravissime adflictae erant naves , earum materia atque aere ad reliquas reficiendas utebatur et quae ad eas res erant usui ex continenti comportari iubebat . <end>$$He therefore provided remedies against all contingencies ; for he daily conveyed corn from the country parts into the camp , used the timber and brass of such ships as were most seriously damaged for repairing the rest , and ordered whatever things besides were necessary for this object to be brought to him from the continent .
<start> Itaque , cum summo studio a militibus administraretur , XII navibus amissis , reliquis ut navigari satis commode posset effecit . <end>$$And thus , since that business was executed by the soldiers with the greatest energy , he effected that , after the loss of twelve ships , a voyage could be made well enough in the rest .
<start> , neque ulla ad id tempus belli suspicione interposita , cum pars hominum in agris remaneret , pars etiam in castra ventitaret , ii qui pro portis castrorum in statione erant Caesari nuntiaverunt pulverem maiorem quam consuetudo ferret in ea parte videri quam in partem legio iter fecisset . <end>$$Caesar , suspecting that which was , —that some new enterprise was undertaken by the barbarians , ordered the two cohorts which were on duty , to march into that quarter with him , and two other cohorts to relieve them on duty ; the rest to be armed and follow him immediately .
<start> Caesar---id quod erat---suspicatus aliquid novi a barbaris initum consilii , cohortes quae in statione erant secum in eam partem proficisci , ex reliquis duas in stationem succedere , reliquas armari et confestim sese subsequi iussit . <end>$$When he had advanced some little way from the camp , he saw that his men were overpowered by the enemy and scarcely able to stand their ground , and that , the legion being crowded together , weapons were being cast on them from all sides .
<start> Cum paulo longius a castris processisset , suos ab hostibus premi atque aegre sustinere et conferta legione ex omnibus partibus tela coici animadvertit . <end>$$For as all the corn was reaped in every part with the exception of one , the enemy , suspecting that our men would repair to that , had concealed themselves in the woods during the night .
<start> Nam quod omni ex reliquis partibus demesso frumento pars una erat reliqua , suspicati hostes huc nostros esse venturos noctu in silvis delituerant ; tum dispersos depositis armis in metendo occupatos Subito adorti paucis interfectis reliquos incertis ordinibus perturbaverant , simul equitatu atque essedis circumdederant . <end>$$Then attacking them suddenly , scattered as they were , and when they had laid aside their arms , and were engaged in reaping , they killed a small number , threw the rest into confusion , and surrounded them with their cavalry and chariots .
<start> Genus hoc est ex essedis pugnae Primo per omnes partes perequitant et tela coiciunt atque ipso terrore equorum et strepitu rotarum ordines plerumque perturbant , et cum se inter equitum turmas insinuaverunt , ex essedis desiliunt et pedibus proeliantur . <end>$$Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this : firstly , they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels ; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse , leap from their chariots and engage on foot .
<start> Aurigae interim paulatim ex proelio excedunt atque ita currus conlocant ut , si illi a multitudine hostium premantur , expeditum ad quos receptum habeant . <end>$$The charioteers in the mean time withdraw some little distance from the battle , and so place themselves with the chariots that , if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy , they may have a ready retreat to their own troops .
<start> Ita mobilitatem equitum , stabilitatem peditum in proeliis praestant , ac tantum usu cotidiano et exercitatione efficiunt uti in declivi ac praecipiti loco incitatos equos sustinere et brevi moderari ac flectere et per temonem percurrere et in iugo insistere et se inde in currus citissime recipere consuerint . <end>$$Thus they display in battle the speed of horse , the firmness of infantry ; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed , even on a declining and steep place , to check their horses at full speed , and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole , and stand on the yoke , and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again .
<start> Quibus rebus perturbatis nostris tempore oportunissimo Caesar auxilium tulit : namque eius adventu hostes constiterunt , nostri se ex timore receperunt Quo facto , ad lacessendum hostem et committendum proelium alienum esse tempus arbitratus suo se loco continuit et brevi tempore intermisso in castra legiones reduxit . <end>$$Under these circumstances , our men being dismayed by the novelty of this mode of battle , Caesar most seasonably brought assistance ; for upon his arrival the enemy paused , and our men recovered from their fear ; upon which thinking the time unfavorable for provoking the enemy and coming to an action , he kept himself in his own quarter , and , a short time having intervened , drew back the legions into the camp .
<start> Dum haec geruntur , nostris omnibus occupatis qui erant in agris reliqui discesserunt . <end>$$While these things are going on , and all our men engaged , the rest of the Britons , who were in the fields , departed .
<start> Secutae sunt continuos complures dies tempeststes , quae et nostros in castris continerent et hostem a pugna prohiberent . <end>$$Storms then set in for several successive days , which both confined our men to the camp and hindered the enemy from attacking us .
<start> Interim barbari nuntios in omnes partes dimiserunt paucitatemque nostrorum militum suis praedicaverunt et quanta praedae faciendae atque in perpetuum sui liberandi facultas daretur , si Romanos castris expulissent , demonstra ; verunt . <end>$$In the mean time the barbarians dispatched messengers to all parts , and reported to their people the small number of our soldiers , and how good an opportunity was given for obtaining spoil and for liberating themselves forever , if they should only drive the Romans from their camp .
<start> His rebus celeriter magna multitudine peditatus equitatusque coacta ad castra venerunt . <end>$$Having by these means speedily got together a large force of infantry and of cavalry they came up to the camp .
<start> Caesar , etsi idem quod superioribus diebus acciderat fore videbat , ut , si essent hostes pulsi , celeritate periculum effugerent , tamen nactus equites circiter XXX , quos Commius Atrebas , de quo ante dictum est , secum transportaverat , legiones in acie pro castris constituit . <end>$$Although Caesar anticipated that the same thing which had happened on former occasions would then occur-that , if the enemy were routed , they would escape from danger by their speed ; still , having got about thirty horse , which Commius the Atrebatian , of whom mention has been made , had brought over with him , he drew up the legions in order of battle before the camp .
<start> Commisso proelio diutius nostrorum militum impetum hostes ferre non potuerunt ac terga verterunt Quos tanto spatio secuti quantum cursu et viribus efficere potuerunt , complures ex iis occiderunt , deinde omnibus longe lateque aedificiis incensis se in castra receperunt . <end>$$When the action commenced , the enemy were unable to sustain the attack of our men long , and turned their backs ; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength permitted , and slew a great number of them ; then , having destroyed and burned every thing far and wide , they retreated to their camp .
<start> Eodem die legati ab hostibus missi ad Caesarem de pace venerunt . <end>$$The same day , embassadors sent by the enemy came to Caesar to negotiate a peace .
<start> His Caesar numerum obsidum quem ante imperaverat duplicavit eosque in continentem adduci iussit , quod propinqua die aequinoctii infirmis navibus hiemi navigationem subiciendam non existimabat . <end>$$Caesar doubled the number of hostages which he had before demanded ; and ordered that they should be brought over to the continent , because , since the time of the equinox was near , he did not consider that , with his ships out of repair , the voyage ought to be deferred till winter .
<start> Ipse idoneam tempestatem nactus paulo post mediam noctem naves solvit , quae omnes incolumes ad continentem pervenerunt ; sed ex iis onerariae duae eosdem portus quos reliquae capere non potuerunt et paulo infra delatae sunt . <end>$$Having met with favorable weather , he set sail a little after midnight , and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent , except two of the ships of burden which could not make the same port which the other ships did , and were carried a little lower down .
<start> Quibus ex navibus cum essent expositi milites circiter CCC atque in castra contenderent , Morini , quos Caesar in Britanniam proficiscens pacatos reliquerat , spe praedae adducti primo non ita magno suorum numero circumsteterunt ac , si sese interfici nollent , arma ponere iusserunt Cum illi orbe facto sese defenderent , celeriter ad clamorem hominum circiter milia VI convenerunt ; Qua re nuntiata , Caesar omnem ex castris equitatum suis auxilio misit . <end>$$When our soldiers , about 300 in number , had been drawn out of these two ships , and were marching to the camp , the Morini , whom Caesar , when setting forth for Britain , had left in a state of peace , excited by the hope of spoil , at first surrounded them with a small number of men , and ordered them to lay down their arms , if they did not wish to be slain ; afterward however , when they , forming a circle , stood on their defense , a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled ; which being reported , Caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as a relief to his men .
<start> Interim nostri milites impetum hostium sustinuerunt atque amplius horis IIII fortissime pugnaverunt et paucis vulneribus acceptis complures ex iis occiderunt . <end>$$In the mean time our soldiers sustained the attack of the enemy , and fought most valiantly for more than four hours , and , receiving but few wounds themselves , slew several of them .
<start> Postea vero quam equitatus noster in conspectum venit , hostes abiectis armis terga verterunt magnusque eorum numerus est occisus . <end>$$But after our cavalry came in sight , the enemy , throwing away their arms , turned their backs , and a great number of them were killed .
<start> Caesar postero die Titus Labienum legatum cum iis legionibus quas ex Britannia reduxerat in Morinos qui rebellionem fecerant misit Qui cum propter siccitates paludum quo se reciperent non haberent , quo perfugio superiore anno erant usi , omnes fere in potestatem Labieni venerunt . <end>$$The day following Caesar sent Labienus , his legate , with those legions which he had brought back from Britain , against the Morini , who had revolted ; who , as they had no place to which they might retreat , on account of the drying up of their marshes , almost all fell into the power of Labienus .
<start> At Quintus Titurius et Lucius Cotta legati , qui in Menapiorum fines legiones duxerant , omnibus eorum agris vastatis , frumentis succisis , aedificiis incensis , quod Menapii se omnes in densissimas silvas abdiderant , se ad Caesarem receperunt . <end>$$In the mean time Caesar's legates , Quintus Titurius and Lucius Cotta , who had led the legions into the territories of the Menapii , having laid waste all their lands , cut down their corn and burned their houses , returned to Caesar because the Menapii had all concealed themselves in their thickest woods .
<start> Caesar in Belgis omnium legionum hiberna constituit . <end>$$Caesar fixed the winter quarters of all the legions among the Belgae .
<start> Eo duae omnino civitates ex Britannia obsides miserunt , reliquae neglexerunt . <end>$$Thither only two British states sent hostages ; the rest omitted to do so .
<start> His rebus gestis ex litteris Caesaris dierum XX supplicatio a senatu decreta est . <end>$$For these successes , a thanksgiving of twenty days was decreed by the senate upon receiving Caesar's letter .
<start> L Domitio Ap Claudio consulibus , discedens ab hibernis Caesar in Italiam , ut quotannis facere consuerat , legatis imperat quos legionibus praefecerat uti quam plurimas possent hieme naves aedificandas veteresque reficiendas curarent . <end>$$While Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius were consuls , Caesar , when departing from his winter quarters into Italy , as he had been accustomed to do yearly , commands the legates whom he appointed over the legions to take care that during the winter as many ships as possible should be built , and the old repaired .
<start> Earum modum formamque demonstrat . <end>$$He plans the size and shape of them .
<start> Ad celeritatem onerandi subductionesque paulo facit humiliores quam quibus in nostro mari uti consuevimus , atque id eo magis , quod propter crebras commutationes aestuum minus magnos ibi fluctus fieri cognoverat ; ad onera , ad multitudinem iumentorum transportandam paulo latiores quam quibus in reliquis utimur maribus . <end>$$For dispatch of lading , and for drawing them on shore , he makes them a little lower than those which we have been accustomed to use in our sea ; and that so much the more , because he knew that , on account of the frequent changes of the tide , less swells occurred there ; for the purpose of transporting burdens and a great number of horses , a little broader than those which we use in other seas .
<start> Has omnes actuarias imperat fieri , quam ad rem multum humilitas adiuvat . <end>$$All these he orders to be constructed for lightness and expedition , to which object their lowness contributes greatly .
<start> Ea quae sunt usui ad armandas naves ex Hispania apportari iubet . <end>$$He orders those things which are necessary for equipping ships to be brought thither from Spain .
<start> Ipse conventibus Galliae citerioris peractis in Illyricum proficiscitur , quod a Pirustis finitimam partem provinciae incursionibus vastari audiebat . <end>$$He himself , on the assizes of Hither Gaul being concluded , proceeds into Illyricum , because he heard that the part of the province nearest them was being laid waste by the incursions of the Pirustae .
<start> Eo cum venisset , civitatibus milites imperat certumque in locum convenire iubet . <end>$$When he had arrived there , he levies soldiers upon the states , and orders them to assemble at an appointed place .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Pirustae legatos ad eum mittunt qui doceant nihil earum rerum publico factum consilio , seseque paratos esse demonstrant omnibus rationibus de iniuriis satisfacere . <end>$$Which circumstance having been reported , the Pirustae send embassadors to him to inform him that no part of those proceedings was done by public deliberation , and assert that they were ready to make compensation by all means for the injuries  .
<start> Accepta oratione eorum Caesar obsides imperat eosque ad certam diem adduci iubet ; nisi ita fecerint , sese bello civitatem persecuturum demonstrat . <end>$$Caesar , accepting their defense , demands hostages , and orders them to be brought to him on a specified day , and assures them that unless they did so he would visit their state with war .
<start> Eis ad diem adductis , ut imperaverat , arbitros inter civitates dat qui litem aestiment poenamque constituant . <end>$$These being brought to him on the day which he had ordered , he appoints arbitrators between the states , who should estimate the damages and determine the reparation .
<start> His confectis rebus conventibusque peractis , in citeriorem Galliam revertitur atque inde ad exercitum proficiscitur . <end>$$These things being finished , and the assizes being concluded , he returns into Hither Gaul , and proceeds thence to the army .
<start> Eo cum venisset , circuitis omnibus hibernis , singulari militum studio in summa omnium rerum inopia circiter sescentas eius generis cuius supra demonstravimus naves et longas XXVIII invenit instructas neque multum abesse ab eo quin paucis diebus deduci possint . <end>$$When he had arrived there , having made a survey of the winter quarter , he finds that , by the extraordinary ardor of the soldiers , amid the utmost scarcity of all materials , about six hundred ships of that kind which we have described above and twenty-eight ships of war , had been built , and were not far from that state , that they might be launched in a few days .
<start> Collaudatis militibus atque eis qui negotio praefuerant , quid fieri velit ostendit atque omnes ad portum Itium convenire iubet , quo ex portu commodissimum in Britanniam traiectum esse cognoverat , circiter milium passuum XXX transmissum a continenti : huic rei quod satis esse visum est militum reliquit . <end>$$Having commended the soldiers and those who had presided over the work , he informs them what he wishes to be done , and orders all the ships to assemble at port Itius , from which port he had learned that the passage into Britain was shortest , about thirty miles from the continent .
<start> Ipse cum legionibus expeditis IIII et equitibus DCCC in fines Treverorum proficiscitur , quod hi neque ad concilia veniebant neque imperio parebant Germanosque Transrhenanos sollicitare dicebantur . <end>$$He left what seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that design ; he himself proceeds into the territories of the Treveri with four legions without baggage , and 800 horse , because they neither came to the general diets , nor obeyed his commands , and were moreover , said to be tampering with the Germans beyond the Rhine .
<start> Haec civitas longe plurimum totius Galliae equitatu valet magnasque habet copias peditum Rhenumque , ut supra demonstravimus , tangit . <end>$$This state is by far the most powerful of all Gaul in cavalry , and has great forces of infantry , and as we have remarked above , borders on the Rhine .
<start> In ea civitate duo de principatu inter se contendebant , Indutiomarus et Cingetorix ; e quibus alter , simul atque de Caesaris legionumque adventu cognitum est , ad eum venit , se suosque omnes in offlcio futuros neque ab amicitia populi Romani defecturos confirmavit quaeque in Treveris gererentur ostendit . <end>$$But Indutiomarus began to collect cavalry and infantry , and make preparations for war , having concealed those who by reason of their age could not be under arms , in the forest Arduenna , which is of immense size , extends from the Rhine across the country of the Treveri to the frontiers of the Remi .
<start> Caesar , etsi intellegebat qua de causa ea dicerentur quaeque eum res ab instituto consilio deterreret , tamen , ne aestatem in Treveris consumere cogeretur omnibus ad Britannicum bellum rebus comparatis , Indutiomarum ad se cum CC obsidibus venire iussit . <end>$$Caesar , though he discerned from what motive these things were said , and what circumstances deterred him from his meditated plan , still , in order that he might not be compelled to waste the summer among the Treveri , while all things were prepared for the war with Britain , ordered Indutiomarus to come to him with 200 hostages .
<start> His adductis , in eis filio propinquisque eius omnibus , quos nominatim evocaverat , consolatus Indutiomarum hortatusque est uti in officio maneret ; nihilo tamen setius principibus Treverorum ad se convocatis hos singillatim Cingetorigi conciliavit , quod cum merito eius a se fieri intellegebat , tum magni interesse arbitrabatur eius auctoritatem inter suos quam plurimum valere , cuius tam egregiam in se voluntatem perspexisset . <end>$$When they were brought , among them his son and near relations , whom he had demanded by name , he consoled Indutiomarus , and enjoined him to continue in his allegiance ; yet , nevertheless , summoning to him the chief men of the Treveri , he reconciled them individually to Cingetorix : this he both thought should be done by him in justice to the merits of the latter , and also judged that it was of great importance that the influence of one whose singular attachment toward him he had fully seen , should prevail as much as possible among his people .
<start> Id tulit factum graviter Indutiomarus , suam gratiam inter suos minui , et , qui iam ante inimico in nos animo fuisset , multo gravius hoc dolore exarsit . <end>$$Indutiomarus was very much offended at this act , his influence was diminished among his countrymen ; and he , who already before had borne a hostile mind toward us , was much more violently inflamed against us through resentment at this .
<start> His rebus constitutis Caesar ad portum Itium cum legionibus pervenit . <end>$$These matters being settled , Caesar went to port Itius with the legions .
<start> Ibi cognoscit LX naves , quae in Meldis factae erant , tempestate reiectas cursum tenere non potuisse atque eodem unde erant profectae revertisse ; reliquas paratas ad navigandum atque omnibus rebus instructas invenit . <end>$$There he discovers that forty ships , which had been built in the country of the Meldi , having been driven back by a storm , had been unable to maintain their course , and had returned to the same port from which they had set out ; he finds the rest ready for sailing , and furnished with every thing .
<start> Eodem equitatus totius Galliae convenit , numero milium quattuor , principesque ex omnibus civitatibus ; ex quibus perpaucos , quorum in se fidem perspexerat , relinquere in Gallia , reliquos obsidum loco secum ducere decreverat , quod , cum ipse abesset , motum Galliae verebatur . <end>$$In the same place , the cavalry of the whole of Gaul , in number 4 , 000 , assembles , and the chief persons of all the states ; he had determined to leave in Gaul a very few of them , whose fidelity toward him he had clearly discerned , and take the rest with him as hostages ; because he feared a commotion in Gaul when he should be absent .
<start> Erat una cum ceteris Dumnorix Aeduus , de quo ante ab nobis dictum est . <end>$$There was together with the others , Dumnorix , the Aeduan , of whom we have made previous mention .
<start> Hunc secum habere in primis constituerat , quod eum cupidum rerum novarum , cupidum imperi , magni animi , magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis cognoverat . <end>$$Him , in particular , he had resolved to have with him , because he had discovered him to be fond of change , fond of power , possessing great resolution , and great influence among the Gauls .
<start> Accedebat huc quod in concilio Aeduorum Dumnorix dixerat sibi a Caesare regnum civitatis deferri ; quod dictum Aedui graviter ferebant , neque recusandi aut deprecandi causa legatos ad Caesarem mittere audebant . <end>$$To this was added , that Dumnorix had before said in an assembly of Aeduans , that the sovereignty of the state had been made over to him by Caesar ; which speech the Aedui bore with impatience and yet dared not send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of either rejecting or deprecating  .
<start> Id factum ex suis hospitibus Caesar cognoverat . <end>$$That fact Caesar had learned from his own personal friends .
<start> Ille omnibus primo precibus petere contendit ut in Gallia relinqueretur , partim quod insuetus navigandi mare timeret , partim quod religionibus impediri sese diceret . <end>$$He at first strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should be left in Gaul ; partly , because , being unaccustomed to sailing , he feared the sea ; partly because he said he was prevented by divine admonitions .
<start> Posteaquam id obstinate sibi negari vidit , omni spe impetrandi adempta principes Galliae sollicitare , sevocare singulos hortarique coepit uti in continenti remanerent metu territare : non sine causa fieri , ut Gallia omni nobilitate spoliaretur ; id esse consilium Caesaris , ut quos in conspectu Galliae interficere vereretur , hos omnes in Britanniam traductos necaret ; fidem reliquis interponere , iusiurandum poscere , ut quod esse ex usu Galliae intellexissent communi consilio administrarent . <end>$$After he saw that this request was firmly refused him , all hope of success being lost , he began to tamper with the chief persons of the Gauls , to call them apart singly and exhort them to remain on the continent ; to agitate them with the fear that it was not without reason that Gaul should be stripped of all her nobility ; that it was Caesar's design , to bring over to Britain and put to death all those whom he feared to slay in the sight of Gaul , to pledge his honor to the rest , to ask for their oath that they would by common deliberation execute what they should perceive to be necessary for Gaul .
<start> Haec a compluribus ad Caesarem deferebantur . <end>$$These things were reported to Caesar by several persons .
<start> Qua re cognita Caesar , quod tantum civitati Aeduae dignitatis tribuebat , coercendum atque deterrendum quibuscumque rebus posset Dumnorigem statuebat ; quod longius eius amentiam progredi videbat , prospiciendum , ne quid sibi ac rei publicae nocere posset . <end>$$Having learned this fact , Caesar , because he had conferred so much honor upon the Aeduan state , determined that Dumnorix should be restrained and deterred by whatever means he could ; and that , because he perceived his insane designs to be proceeding further and further , care should be taken lest he might be able to injure him and the commonwealth .
<start> Itaque dies circiter XXV in eo loco commoratus , quod Corus ventus navigationem impediebat , qui magnam partem omnis temporis in his locis flare consuevit , dabat operam ut in officio Dumnorigem contineret , nihilo tamen setius omnia eius consilia cognosceret : tandem idoneam nactus tempestatem milites equitesque conscendere in naves iubet . <end>$$Therefore , having stayed about twenty-five days in that place , because the north wind , which usually blows a great part of every season , prevented the voyage , he exerted himself to keep Dumnorix in his allegiance nevertheless learn all his measures : having at length met with favorable weather , he orders the foot soldiers and the horse to embark in the ships .
<start> At omnium impeditis animis Dumnorix cum equitibus Aeduorum a castris insciente Caesare domum discedere coepit . <end>$$But , while the minds of all were occupied , Dumnorix began to take his departure from the camp homeward with the cavalry of the Aedui , Caesar being ignorant of it .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Caesar intermissa profectione atque omnibus rebus postpositis magnam partem equitatus ad eum insequendum mittit retrahique imperat ; si vim faciat neque pareat , interfici iubet , nihil hunc se absente pro sano facturum arbitratus , qui praesentis imperium neglexisset . <end>$$Caesar , on this matter being reported to him , ceasing from his expedition and deferring all other affairs , sends a great part of the cavalry to pursue him , and commands that he be brought back ; he orders that if he use violence and do not submit , that he be slain ; considering that Dumnorix would do nothing as a rational man while he himself was absent , since he had disregarded his command even when present .
<start> Ille enim revocatus resistere ac se manu defendere suorumque fidem implorare coepit , saepe clamitans liberum se liberaeque esse civitatis . <end>$$He , however , when recalled , began to resist and defend himself with his hand , and implore the support of his people , often exclaiming that he was free and the subject of a free state .
<start> Illi , ut erat imperatum , circumsistunt hominem atque interficiunt : at equites Aedui ad Caesarem omnes revertuntur . <end>$$They surround and kill the man as they had been commanded ; but the Aeduan horsemen all return to Caesar .
<start> His rebus gestis , Labieno in continente cum tribus legionibus et equitum milibus duobus relicto ut portus tueretur et rem frumentariam provideret quaeque in Gallia gererentur cognosceret consiliumque pro tempore et pro re caperet , ipse cum quinque legionibus et pari numero equitum , quem in continenti reliquerat , ad solis occasum naves solvit et leni Africo provectus media circiter nocte vento intermisso cursum non tenuit , et longius delatus aestu orta luce sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit . <end>$$When these things were done Labienus , left on the continent with three legions and 2 , 000 horse , to defend the harbors and provide corn , and discover what was going on in Gaul , and take measures according to the occasion and according to the circumstance ; he himself , with five legions and a number of horse , equal to that which he was leaving on the continent , set sail at sun-set , and borne forward by a gentle south-west wind , he did not maintain his course , in consequence of the wind dying away about midnight , and being carried on too far by the tide , when the sun rose , espied Britain passed on his left .
<start> Tum rursus aestus commutationem secutus remis contendit ut eam partem insulae caperet , qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat Qua in re admodum fuit militum virtus laudanda , qui vectoriis gravibusque navigiis non intermisso remigandi labore longarum navium cursum adaequarunt . <end>$$Then , again , following the change of tide , he urged on with the oars that he might make that part of the island in which he had discovered the preceding summer , that there was the best landing-place , and in this affair the spirit of our soldiers was very much to be extolled ; for they with the transports and heavy ships , the labor of rowing not being discontinued , equaled the speed of the ships of war .
<start> Accessum est ad Britanniam omnibus navibus meridiano fere tempore , neque in eo loco hostis est visus ; sed , ut postea Caesar ex captivis cognovit , cum magnae manus eo convenissent , multitudine navium perterritae , quae cum annotinis privatisque quas sui quisque commodi fecerat amplius octingentae uno erant visae tempore , a litore discesserant ac se in superiora loca abdiderant . <end>$$All the ships reached Britain nearly at mid-day ; nor was there seen a enemy in that place , but , as Caesar afterward found from some prisoners , though large bodies of troops had assembled there , yet being alarmed by the great number of our ships , more than eight hundred of which , including the ships of the preceding year , and those private vessels which each had built for his own convenience , had appeared at one time , they had quitted the coast and concealed themselves among the higher points .
<start> Caesar exposito exercitu et loco castris idoneo capto , ubi ex captivis cognovit quo in loco hostium copiae consedissent , cohortibus decem ad mare relictis et equitibus trecentis , qui praesidio navibus essent , de tertia vigilia ad hostes contendit , eo minus veritus navibus , quod in litore molli atque aperto deligatas ad ancoram relinquebat , et praesidio navibus Quintus Atrium praefecit . <end>$$Caesar , having disembarked his army and chosen a convenient place for the camp , when he discovered from the prisoners in what part the forces of the enemy had lodged themselves , having left ten cohorts and 300 horse at the sea , to be a guard to the ships , hastens to the enemy , at the third watch , fearing the less for the ships , for this reason because he was leaving them fastened at anchor upon an even and open shore ; and he placed Quintus Atrius over the guard of the ships .
<start> Ipse noctu progressus milia passuum circiter XII hostium copias conspicatus est . <end>$$He himself , having advanced by night about twelve miles , espied the forces of the enemy .
<start> Illi equitatu atque essedis ad flumen progressi ex loco superiore nostros prohibere et proelium committere coeperunt . <end>$$They , advancing to the river with their cavalry and chariots from the higher ground , began to annoy our men and give battle .
<start> Repulsi ab equitatu se in silvas abdiderunt , locum nacti egregie et natura et opere munitum , quem domestici belli , ut videbantur , causa iam ante praeparaverant : nam crebris arboribus succisis omnes introitus erant praeclusi . <end>$$Being repulsed by our cavalry , they concealed themselves in woods , as they had secured a place admirably fortified by nature and by art , which , as it seemed , they had before prepared on account of a civil war ; for all entrances to it were shut up by a great number of felled trees .
<start> Ipsi ex silvis rari propugnabant nostrosque intra munitiones ingredi prohibebant . <end>$$They themselves rushed out of the woods to fight here and there , and prevented our men from entering their fortifications .
<start> At milites legionis septimae , testudine facta et aggere ad munitiones adiecto , locum ceperunt eosque ex silvis expulerunt paucis vulneribus acceptis . <end>$$But the soldiers of the seventh legion , having formed a testudo and thrown up a rampart against the fortification , took the place and drove them out of the woods , receiving only a few wounds .
<start> Sed eos fugientes longius Caesar prosequi vetuit , et quod loci naturam ignorabat , et quod magna parte diei consumpta munitioni castrorum tempus relinqui volebat . <end>$$But Caesar forbade his men to pursue them in their flight any great distance ; both because he was ignorant of the nature of the ground , and because , as a great part of the day was spent , he wished time to be left for the fortification of the camp .
<start> Postridie eius diei mane tripertito milites equitesque in expeditionem misit , ut eos qui fugerant persequerentur . <end>$$The next day , early in the morning , he sent both foot-soldiers and horse in three divisions on an expedition to pursue those who had fled .
<start> His aliquantum itineris progressis , cum iam extremi essent in prospectu , equites a Quinto Atrio ad Caesarem venerunt , qui nuntiarent superiore nocte maxima coorta tempestate prope omnes naves adflictas atque in litore eiectas esse , quod neque ancorae funesque subsisterent , neque nautae gubernatoresque vim tempestatis pati possent ; itaque ex eo concursu navium magnum esse incommodum acceptum . <end>$$These having advanced a little way , when already the rear was in sight , some horse came to Caesar from Quintus Atrius , to report that the preceding night , a very great storm having arisen , almost all the ships were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore , because neither the anchors and cables could resist , nor could the sailors and pilots sustain the violence of the storm ; and thus great damage was received by that collision of the ships .
<start> His rebus cognitis Caesar legiones equitatumque revocari atque in itinere resistere iubet , ipse ad naves revertitur ; eadem fere quae ex nuntiis litterisque cognoverat coram perspicit , sic ut amissis circiter XL navibus reliquae tamen refici posse magno negotio viderentur . <end>$$These things being known , Caesar orders the legions and cavalry to be recalled and to cease from their march ; he himself returns to the ships : he sees clearly before him almost the same things which he had heard of from the messengers and by letter , so that , about forty ships being lost , the remainder seemed capable of being repaired with much labor .
<start> Itaque ex legionibus fabros deligit et ex continenti alios arcessi iubet ; Labieno scribit , ut quam plurimas posset eis legionibus , quae sunt apud eum , naves instituat . <end>$$Therefore he selects workmen from the legions , and orders others to be sent for from the continent ; he writes to Labienus to build as many ships as he could with those legions which were with him .
<start> Ipse , etsi res erat multae operae ac laboris , tamen commodissimum esse statuit omnes naves subduci et cum castris una munitione coniungi . <end>$$He himself , though the matter was one of great difficulty and labor , yet thought it to be most expedient for all the ships to be brought up on shore and joined with the camp by one fortification .
<start> In his rebus circiter dies X consumit ne nocturnis quidem temporibus ad laborem militum intermissis . <end>$$In these matters he employed about ten days , the labor of the soldiers being unremitting even during the hours of night .
<start> Subductis navibus castrisque egregie munitis easdem copias , quas ante , praesidio navibus reliquit : ipse eodem unde redierat proficiscitur . <end>$$The ships having been brought up on shore and the camp strongly fortified , he left the same forces as he did before as a guard for the ships ; he sets out in person for the same place that he had returned from .
<start> Eo cum venisset , maiores iam undique in eum locum copiae Britannorum convenerant summa imperi bellique administrandi communi consilio permissa Cassivellauno , cuius fines a maritimis civitatibus flumen dividit , quod appellatur Tamesis , a mari circiter milia passuum LXXX . <end>$$When he had come thither , greater forces of the Britons had already assembled at that place , the chief command and management of the war having been intrusted to Cassivellaunus , whose territories a river , which is called the Thames , separates , from the maritime states at about eighty miles from the sea .
<start> Huic superiore tempore cum reliquis civitatibus continentia bella intercesserant ; sed nostro adventu permoti Britanni hunc toti bello imperioque praefecerant . <end>$$At an earlier period perpetual wars had taken place between him and the other states ; but , greatly alarmed by our arrival , the Britons had placed him over the whole war and the conduct of it .
<start> Britanniae pars interior ab eis incolitur quos natos in insula ipsi memoria proditum dicunt , maritima ab eis , qui praedae ac belli inferendi causa ex Belgio transierunt (qui omnes fere eis nominibus civitatum appellantur , quibus orti ex civitatibus eo pervenerunt) et bello illato ibi permanserunt atque agros colere coeperunt . <end>$$The interior portion of Britain is inhabited by those of whom they say that it is handed down by tradition that they were born in the island itself : the maritime portion by those who had passed over from the country of the Belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war ; almost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which being sprung they went thither , and having waged war , continued there and began to cultivate the lands .
<start> Hominum est infinita multitudo creberrimaque aedificia fere Gallicis consimilia , pecorum magnus numerus . <end>$$The number of the people is countless , and their buildings exceedingly numerous , for the most part very like those of the Gauls : the number of cattle is great .
<start> Vtuntur aut aere aut nummo aureo aut taleis ferreis ad certum pondus examinatis pro nummo . <end>$$They use either brass or iron rings , determined at a certain weight , as their money .
<start> Nascitur ibi plumbum album in mediterraneis regionibus , in maritimis ferrum , sed eius exigua est copia ; aere utuntur importato . <end>$$Tin is produced in the midland regions ; in the maritime , iron ; but the quantity of it is small : they employ brass , which is imported .
<start> Materia cuiusque generis ut in Gallia est , praeter fagum atque abietem . <end>$$There , as in Gaul , is timber of every description , except beech and fir .
<start> Leporem et gallinam et anserem gustare fas non putant ; haec tamen alunt animi voluptatisque causa . <end>$$They do not regard it lawful to eat the hare , and the cock , and the goose ; they , however , breed them for amusement and pleasure .
<start> Loca sunt temperatiora quam in Gallia , remissioribus frigoribus . <end>$$The climate is more temperate than in Gaul , the colds being less severe .
<start> Insula natura triquetra , cuius unum latus est contra Galliam . <end>$$The island is triangular in its form , and one of its sides is opposite to Gaul .
<start> Huius lateris alter angulus , qui est ad Cantium , quo fere omnes ex Gallia naves appelluntur , ad orientem solem , inferior ad meridiem spectat . <end>$$One angle of this side , which is in Kent , whither almost all ships from Gaul are directed , to the east ; the lower looks to the south .
<start> Hoc pertinet circiter mila passuum quingenta . <end>$$This side extends about 500 miles .
<start> Alterum vergit ad Hispaniam atque occidentem solem ; qua ex parte est Hibernia , dimidio minor , ut aestimatur , quam Britannia , sed pari spatio transmissus atque ex Gallia est in Britanniam . <end>$$Another side lies toward Spain and the west , on which part is Ireland , less , as is reckoned , than Britain , by one half : but the passage into Britain is of equal distance with that from Gaul .
<start> In hoc medio cursu est insula , quae appellatur Mona : complures praeterea minores subiectae insulae existimantur , de quibus insulis nonnulli scripserunt dies continuos triginta sub bruma esse noctem . <end>$$In the middle of this voyage , is an island , which is called Mona : many smaller islands besides are supposed to lie , of which islands some have written that at the time of the winter solstice it is night there for thirty consecutive days .
<start> Nos nihil de eo percontationibus reperiebamus , nisi certis ex aqua mensuris breviores esse quam in continenti noctes videbamus . <end>$$We , in our inquiries about that matter , ascertained nothing , except that , by accurate measurements with water , we perceived the nights to be shorter there than on the continent .
<start> Huius est longitudo lateris , ut fert illorum opinio , septingentorum milium . <end>$$The length of this side , as their account states , is 700 miles .
<start> Tertium est contra septentriones ; cui parti nulla est obiecta terra , sed eius angulus lateris maxime ad Germaniam spectat . <end>$$The third side is toward the north , to which portion of the island no land is opposite ; but an angle of that side looks principally toward Germany .
<start> Hoc milia passuum octingenta in longitudinem esse existimatur . <end>$$This side is considered to be 800 miles in length .
<start> Ita omnis insula est in circuitu vicies centum milium passuum . <end>$$Thus the whole island is 2 , 000 miles in circumference .
<start> Ex his omnibus longe sunt humanissimi qui Cantium incolunt , quae regio est maritima omnis , neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine . <end>$$The most civilized of all these nations are they who inhabit Kent , which is entirely a maritime district , nor do they differ much from the Gallic customs .
<start> Interiores plerique frumenta non serunt , sed lacte et carne vivunt pellibusque sunt vestiti . <end>$$All the Britons , indeed , dye themselves with woad , which occasions a bluish color , and thereby have a more terrible appearance in fight .
<start> Equites hostium essedariique acriter proelio cum equitatu nostro in itinere conflixerunt , tamen ut nostri omnibus partibus superiores fuerint atque eos in silvas collesque compulerint ; sed compluribus interfectis cupidius insecuti nonnullos ex suis amiserunt . <end>$$The horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in a skirmish with our cavalry on the march ; yet so that our men were conquerors in all parts , and drove them to their woods and hills ; but , having slain a great many , they pursued too eagerly , and lost some of their men .
<start> At illi intermisso spatio imprudentibus nostris atque occupatis in munitione castrorum subito se ex statione pro castris collocati , acriter pugnaverunt , duabusque missis subsidio cohortibus a Caesare atque eis primis legionum duarum , cum hae perexiguo intermisso loci spatio inter se constitissent , novo genere pugnae perterritis nostris per medios audacissime perruperunt seque inde incolumes receperunt . <end>$$But the enemy , after some time had elapsed , when our men were off their guard , and occupied in the fortification of the camp , rushed out of the woods , and making an attack upon those who were placed on duty before the camp , fought in a determined manner ; and two cohorts being sent by Caesar to their relief , and these severally the first of two legions , when these had taken up their position at a very small distance from each other , as our men were disconcerted by the unusual mode of battle , the enemy broke through the middle of them most courageously , and retreated thence in safety .
<start> Eo die Quintus Laberius Durus , tribunus militum , interficitur . <end>$$That day , Quintus Laberius Durus , a tribune of the soldiers , was slain .
<start> Illi pluribus submissis cohortibus repelluntur . <end>$$The enemy , since more cohorts were sent against them , were repulsed .
<start> Toto hoc in genere pugnae , cum sub oculis omnium ac pro castris dimicaretur , intellectum est nostros propter gravitatem armorum , quod neque insequi cedentes possent neque ab signis discedere auderent , minus aptos esse ad huius generis hostem , equites autem magno cum periculo proelio dimicare , propterea quod illi etiam consulto plerumque cederent et , cum paulum ab legionibus nostros removissent , ex essedis desilirent et pedibus dispari proelio contenderent . <end>$$In the whole of this method of fighting since the engagement took place under the eyes of all and before the camp , it was perceived that our men , on account of the weight of their arms , inasmuch as they could neither pursue retreating , nor dare quit their standards , were little suited to this kind of enemy ; that the horse also fought with great danger , because they generally retreated even designedly , and , when they had drawn off our men a short distance from the legions , leaped from their chariots and fought on foot in unequal battle .
<start> Equestris autem proeli ratio et cedentibus et insequentibus par atque idem periculum inferebat . <end>$$But the system of cavalry engagement is wont to produce equal danger , and indeed the same , both to those who retreat and to those who pursue .
<start> Accedebat huc ut numquam conferti sed rari magnisque intervallis proeliarentur stationesque dispositas haberent , atque alios alii deinceps exciperent , integrique et recentes defetigatis succederent . <end>$$To this was added , that they never fought in close order , but in small parties and at great distances , and had detachments placed , and then the one relieved the other , and the vigorous and fresh succeeded the wearied .
<start> Postero die procul a castris hostes in collibus constiterunt rarique se ostendere et lenius quam pridie nostros equites proelio lacessere coeperunt . <end>$$The following day the enemy halted on the hills , a distance from our camp , and presented themselves in small parties , and began to challenge our horse to battle with less spirit than the day before .
<start> Sed meridie , cum Caesar pabulandi causa tres legiones atque omnem equitatum cum Gaio Trebonio legato misisset , repente ex omnibus partibus ad pabulatores advolaverunt , sic uti ab signis legionibusque non absisterent . <end>$$But at noon , when Caesar had sent three legions , and all the cavalry , with Gaius Trebonius , the legate , for the purpose of foraging , they flew upon the foragers suddenly from all quarters , so that they did not keep off from the standards and the legions .
<start> Nostri acriter in eos impetu facto reppulerunt neque finem sequendi fecerunt , quoad subsidio confisi equites , cum post se legiones viderent , praecipites hostes egerunt magnoque eorum numero interfecto neque sui colligendi neque consistendi aut ex essedis desiliendi facultatem dederunt . <end>$$Our men making an attack on them vigorously , repulsed them ; nor did they cease to pursue them until the horse , relying on relief , as they saw the legions behind them , drove the enemy precipitately before them , and slaying a great number of them , did not give them the opportunity either of rallying , or halting , or leaping from their chariots .
<start> Ex hac fuga protinus , quae undique convenerant , auxilia discesserunt , neque post id tempus umquam summis nobiscum copiis hostes contenderunt . <end>$$Immediately after this retreat , the auxiliaries who had assembled from all sides , departed ; nor after that time did the enemy ever engage with us in very large numbers .
<start> Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen Tamesim in fines Cassivellauni exercitum duxit ; quod flumen uno omnino loco pedibus , atque hoc aegre , transiri potest . <end>$$Caesar , discovering their design , leads his army into the territories of Cassivellaunus to the river Thames ; which river can be forded in one place only and that with difficulty .
<start> Eo cum venisset , animum advertit ad alteram fluminis ripam magnas esse copias hostium instructas Ripa autem erat acutis sudibus praefixis munita , eiusdemque generis sub aqua defixae sudes flumine tegebantur . <end>$$When he had arrived there , he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were marshaled on the other bank of the river ; the bank also was defended by sharp stakes fixed in front , and stakes of the same kind fixed under the water were covered by the river .
<start> His rebus cognitis a captivis perfugisque Caesar praemisso equitatu confestim legiones subsequi iussit . <end>$$These things being discovered from prisoners and deserters , Caesar , sending forward the cavalry , ordered the legions to follow them immediately .
<start> Sed ea celeritate atque eo impetu milites ierunt , cum capite solo ex aqua exstarent , ut hostes impetum legionum atque equitum sustinere non possent ripasque dimitterent ac se fugae mandarent . <end>$$But the soldiers advanced with such speed and such ardor , though they stood above the water by their heads only , that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legions and of the horse , and quitted the banks , and committed themselves to flight .
<start> Cassivellaunus , ut supra demonstravimus , omni deposita spe contentionis dimissis amplioribus copiis milibus circiter quattuor essedariorum relictis itinera nostra servabat paulumque ex via excedebat locisque impeditis ac silvestribus sese occultabat , atque eis regionibus quibus nos iter facturos cognoverat pecora atque homines ex agris in silvas compellebat et , cum equitatus noster liberius praedandi vastandique causa se in agros eiecerat , omnibus viis semitisque essedarios ex silvis emittebat et magno cum periculo nostrorum equitum cum eis confligebat atque hoc metu latius vagari prohibebat . <end>$$Cassivellaunus , as we have stated above , all hope of battle being laid aside , the greater part of his forces being dismissed , and about 4 , 000 charioteers only being left , used to observe our marches and retire a little from the road , and conceal himself in intricate and woody places , and in those neighborhoods in which he had discovered we were about to march , he used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from the fields into the woods ; and , when our cavalry , for the sake of plundering and ravaging the more freely , scattered themselves among the fields , he used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the well-known roads and paths , and to the great danger of our horse , engage with them ; and this source of fear hindered them from straggling very extensively .
<start> Relinquebatur ut neque longius ab agmine legionum discedi Caesar pateretur , et tantum in agris vastandis incendiisque faciendis hostibus noceretur , quantum labore atque itinere legionarii milites efficere poterant . <end>$$The result was , that Caesar did not allow excursions to be made to a great distance from the main body of the legions , and ordered that damage should be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands , and kindling fires only so far as the legionary soldiers could , by their own exertion and marching , accomplish it .
<start> Interim Trinobantes , prope firmissima earum regionum civitas , ex qua Mandubracius adulescens Caesaris fidem secutus ad eum in continentem Galliam venerat , cuius pater in ea civitate regnum obtinuerat interfectusque erat a Cassivellauno , ipse fuga mortem vitaverat , legatos ad Caesarem mittunt pollicenturque sese ei dedituros atque imperata facturos ; petunt , ut Mandubracium ab iniuria Cassivellauni defendat atque in civitatem mittat , qui praesit imperiumque obtineat . <end>$$In the mean time , the Trinobantes , almost the most powerful state of those parts , from which the young man , Mandubracius embracing the protection of Caesar had come to the continent of Gaul to him , send embassadors to Caesar , and promise that they will surrender themselves to him and perform his commands ; they entreat him to protect Mandubracius from the violence of Cassivellaunus , and send to their state some one to preside over it , and possess the government .
<start> His Caesar imperat obsides quadraginta frumentumque exercitui Mandubraciumque ad eos mittit . <end>$$Caesar demands forty hostages from them , and corn for his army , and sends Mandubracius to them .
<start> Illi imperata celeriter fecerunt , obsides ad numerum frumentumque miserunt . <end>$$They speedily performed the things demanded , and sent hostages to the number appointed , and the corn .
<start> Trinobantibus defensis adque ab omni militum niuria prohibitis Cenimagni , Segontiaci , Ancalites , Bibroci , Cassi legationibus missis sese Caesari dedumt . <end>$$The Trinobantes being protected and secured from any violence of the soldiers , the Cenimagni , the Segontiaci , the Ancalites , the Bibroci , and the Cassi , sending embassies , surrendered themselves to Caesar .
<start> Oppidum autem Britanni vocant , cum silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt , quo incursionis hostium vitandae causa convenire consuerunt . <end>$$From them he learns that the capital town of Cassivellaunus was not far from that place , and was defended by woods and morasses , and a very large number of men and of cattle had been collected in it .
<start> Eo proficiscitur cum legionibus : locum reperit egregie natura atque opere munitum ; tamen hunc duabus ex partibus oppugnare contendit . <end>$$Thither he proceeds with his legions : he finds the place admirably fortified by nature and art ; he , however , undertakes to attack it in two directions .
<start> Hostes paulisper morati militum nostrorum impetum non tulerunt seseque alia ex parte oppidi eiecerunt . <end>$$The enemy , having remained only a short time , did not sustain the attack of our soldiers , and hurried away on the other side of the town .
<start> Dum haec in his locis geruntur , Cassivellaunus ad Cantium , quod esse ad mare supra demonstravimus , quibus regionibus quattuor reges praeerant , Cingetorix , Carvilius , Taximagulus , Segovax , nuntios mittit atque eis imperat uti coactis omnibus copiis castra navalia de improviso adoriantur atque oppugent . <end>$$While these things are going forward in those places , Cassivellaunus sends messengers into Kent , which , we have observed above , is on the sea , over which several districts four kings reigned , Cingetorix , Carvilius , Taximagulus and Segovax , and commands them to collect all their forces , and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval camp .
<start> Ei cum ad castra venissent , nostri eruptione facta multis eorum interfectis , capto etiam nobili duce Lugotorige suos incolumes reduxerunt . <end>$$When they had come to the camp , our men , after making a sally , slaying many of their men , and also capturing a distinguished leader named Lugotorix , brought back their own men in safety .
<start> Cassivellaunus hoc proelio nuntiato tot detrimentis acceptis , vastatis finibus , maxime etiam permotus defectione civitatum legatos per Atrebatem Commium de deditione ad Caesarem mittit . <end>$$Cassivellaunus , when this battle was reported to him as so many losses had been sustained , and his territories laid waste , being alarmed most of all by the desertion of the states , sends embassadors to Caesar about a surrender through the mediation of Commius the Atrebatian .
<start> Caesar , cum constituisset hiemare in continenti propter repentinos Galliae motus , neque multum aestatis superesset , atque id facile extrahi posse intellegeret , obsides imperat et quid in annos singulos vectigalis populo Romano Britannia penderet constituit ; interdicit atque imperat Cassivellauno , ne Mandubracio neu Trinobantibus noceat . <end>$$Caesar , since he had determined to pass the winter on the continent , on account of the sudden revolts of Gaul , and as much of the summer did not remain , and he perceived that even that could be easily protracted , demands hostages , and prescribes what tribute Britain should pay each year to the Roman people ; he forbids and commands Cassivellaunus that he not wage war against Mandubracius or the Trinobantes .
<start> Obsidibus acceptis exercitum reducit ad mare , naves invenit refectas . <end>$$When he had received the hostages , he leads back the army to the sea , and finds the ships repaired .
<start> His deductis , quod et captivorum magnum numerum habebat , et nonnullae tempestate deperierant naves , duobus commeatibus exercitum reportare instituit . <end>$$After launching these , because he had a large number of prisoners , and some of the ships had been lost in the storm , he determines to convey back his army at two embarkations .
<start> Ac sic accidit , uti ex tanto navium numero tot navigationibus neque hoc neque superiore anno ulla omnino navis , quae milites portaret , desideraretur ; at ex eis , quae inanes ex continenti ad eum remitterentur et prioris commeatus expositis militibus et quas postea Labienus faciendas curaverat numero LX , perpaucae locum caperent , reliquae fere omnes reicerentur Quas cum aliquamdiu Caesar frustra exspectasset , ne anni tempore a navigatione excluderetur , quod aequinoctium suberat , necessario angustius milites collocavit ac summa tranquillitate consecuta , secunda inita cum solvisset vigilia , prima luce terram attigit omnesque incolumes naves perduxit . <end>$$And it so happened , that out of so large a number of ships , in so many voyages , neither in this nor in the previous year was any ship missing which conveyed soldiers ; but very few out of those which were sent back to him from the continent empty , as the soldiers of the former convoy had been disembarked , and out of those which Labienus had taken care to have built , reached their destination ; almost all the rest were driven back , and when Caesar had waited for them for some time in vain , lest he should be debarred from a voyage by the season of the year , inasmuch as the equinox was at hand , he of necessity stowed his soldiers the more closely , and , a very great calm coming on , after he had weighed anchor at the beginning of the second watch , he reached land at break of day and brought in all the ships in safety .
<start> Subductis navibus concilioque Gallorum Samarobrivae peracto , quod eo anno frumentum in Gallia propter siccitates angustius provenerat , coactus est aliter ac superioribus annis exercitum in hibernis collocare legionesque in plures civitates distribuere Ex quibus unam in Morinos ducendam Gaio Fabio legato dedit , alteram in Nervios Quinto Ciceroni , tertiam in Esubios Lucio Roscio ; quartam in Remis cum Tito Labieno in confinio Treverorum hiemare iussit . <end>$$The ships having been drawn up and a general assembly of the Gauls held at Samarobriva , because the corn that year had not prospered in Gaul by reason of the droughts , he was compelled to station his army in its winter-quarters differently from the former years , and to distribute the legions among several states : one of them he gave to Gaius Fabius , his legate , to be marched into the territories of the Morini ; a second to Quintus Cicero , into those of the Nervii ; a third to Lucius Roscius , into those of the Esubii ; a fourth he ordered to winter with Titus Labienus among the Remi in the confines of the Treveri ; he stationed three in Belgium ; over these he appointed Marcus Crassus , his quaestor , and Lucius Munatius Plancus and Gaius Trebonius , his legates .
<start> Tres in Belgis collocavit : eis Marcum Crassum quaestorem et Lucium Munatium Plancum et Gaium Trebonium legatos praefecit Vnam legionem , quam proxime trans Padum conscripserat , et cohortes V in Eburones , quorum pars maxima est inter Mosam ac Rhenum , qui sub imperio Ambiorigis et Catuvolci erant , misit . <end>$$One legion which he had raised last on the other side of the Po , and five cohorts , he sent among the Eburones , the greatest portion of whom lie between the Meuse and the Rhine , who were under the government of Ambiorix and Catuvolcus .
<start> Eis militibus Quintum Titurium Sabinum et Lucium Aurunculeium Cottam legatos praeesse iussit . <end>$$He ordered Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta , his legates , to take command of these soldiers .
<start> Ad hunc modum distributis legionibus facillime inopiae frumentariae sese mederi posse existimavit Atque harum tamen omnium legionum hiberna praeter eam , quam Lucio Roscio im pacatissimam et quietissimam partem ducendam dederat , milibus passuum centum continebantur . <end>$$The legions being distributed in this manner , he thought he could most easily remedy the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarters of all these legions were comprehended within 100 miles .
<start> Ipse interea , quoad legiones collocatas munitaque hiberna cognovisset , in Gallia morari constituit . <end>$$He himself in the mean while , until he had stationed the legions and knew that the several winter-quarters were fortified , determined to stay in Gaul .
<start> Erat in Carnutibus summo loco natus Tasgetius , cuius maiores in sua civitate regnum obtinuerant . <end>$$There was among the Carnutes a man named Tasgetius , born of very high rank , whose ancestors had held the sovereignty in his state .
<start> Huic Caesar pro eius virtute atque in se benevolentia , quod in omnibus bellis singulari eius onera fuerat usus , maiorum locum restituerat . <end>$$To him Caesar had restored the position of his ancestors , in consideration of his prowess and attachment toward him , because in all his wars he had availed himself of his valuable services .
<start> Tertium iam hunc annum regnantem inimici , multis palam ex civitate eius auctoribus , eum interfecerunt . <end>$$His personal enemies had killed him when in the third year of his reign , many even of his own state being openly promoters This event is related to Caesar .
<start> Defertur ea res ad Caesarem Ille veritus , quod ad plures pertinebat , ne civitas eorum impulsu deficeret , Lucium Plancum cum legione ex Belgio celeriter in Carnutes proficisci iubet ibique hiemare quorumque opera cognoverat Tasgetium interfectum , hos comprehensos ad se mittere . <end>$$He fearing , because several were involved in the act , that the state might revolt at their instigation , orders Lucius Plancus , with a legion , to proceed quickly from Belgium to the Carnutes , and winter there , and arrest and send to him the persons by whose instrumentality he should discover that Tasgetius was slain .
<start> Interim ab omnibus legatis quaestoreque , quibus legiones tradiderat , certior factus est in hiberna perventum locumque hibernis esse munitum . <end>$$In the mean time , he was apprised by all the legates and quaestors to whom he had assigned the legions , that they had arrived in winter-quarters , and that the place for the quarters was fortified .
<start> Diebus circiter XV , quibus in hiberna ventum est , initium repentini tumultus ac defectionis ortum est ab Ambiorige et Catuvolco ; qui , cum ad fines regni sui Sabino Cottaeque praesto fuissent frumentumque in hiberna comportavissent , Indutiomari Treveri nuntiis impulsi suos concitaverunt subitoque oppressis lignatoribus magna manu ad castra oppugnatum venerunt . <end>$$About fifteen days after they had come into winter-quarters , the beginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arose from Ambiorix and Catuvolcus , who , though they had met with Sabinus and Cotta at the borders of their kingdom , and had conveyed corn into our winter-quarters , induced by the messages of Indutiomarus , one of the Treveri , excited their people , and after having suddenly assailed the soldiers engaged in procuring wood , came with a large body to attack the camp .
<start> Cum celeriter nostri arma cepissent vallumque adscendissent atque una ex parte Hispanis equitibus emissis equestri proelio superiores fuissent , desperata re hostes suos ab oppugnatione reduxerunt . <end>$$When our men had speedily taken up arms and had ascended the rampart , and sending out some Spanish horse on one side , had proved conquerors in a cavalry action , the enemy , despairing of success , drew off their troops from the assault .
<start> Tum suo more conclamaverunt , uti aliqui ex nostris ad colloquium prodiret : habere sese , quae de re communi dicere vellent , quibus rebus controversias minui posse sperarent . <end>$$Then they shouted , according to their custom , that some of our men should go forward to a conference , that they had some things which they desired to say respecting the common interest , by which they trusted their disputes could be removed .
<start> Mittitur ad eos colloquendi causa Gaius Arpineius , eques Romanus , familiaris Quinti Tituri , et Quintus Iunius ex Hispania quidam , qui iam ante missu Caesaris ad Ambiorigem ventitare consuerat ; apud quos Ambiorix ad hunc modum locutus est : Sese pro Caesaris in se beneficiis plurimum ei confiteri debere , quod eius opera stipendio liberatus esset , quod Aduatucis , finitimis suis , pendere consuesset , quodque ei et filius et fratris filius ab Caesare remissi essent , quos Aduatuci obsidum numero missos apud in servitute et catenis tenuissent ; neque id , quod tecerit de oppugnatione castrorum , aut iudicio aut voluntate sua fecisse , sed coactu civitatis , suaque esse eiusmodi imperia , ut non minus haberet iuris in se multitudo quam ipse in multitudinem . <end>$$Gaius Arpineius , a Roman knight , the intimate friend of Quintus Titurius , and with him , Quintus Junius , a certain person from Spain , who already on previous occasions , had been accustomed to go to Ambiorix , at Caesar's mission , is sent to them for the purpose of a conference : before them Ambiorix spoke to this effect : That he confessed , that for Caesar's kindness toward him , he was very much indebted to him , inasmuch as by his aid he had been freed from a tribute which he had been accustomed to pay to the Aduatuci , his neighbors ; and because his own son and the son of his brother had been sent back to him , whom , when sent in the number of hostages , the Aduatuci had detained among them in slavery and in chains ; and that he had not done that which he had done in regard to the attacking of the camp , either by his own judgment or desire , but by the compulsion of his state ; and that his government was of that nature , that the people had as much authority over him as he over the people .
<start> Non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse , praesertim cum de recuperanda communi libertate consilium initum videretur Quibus quoniam pro pietate satisfecerit , habere nunc se rationem offici pro beneficiis Caesaris : monere , orare Titurium pro hospitio , ut suae ac militum saluti consulat Magnam manum Germanorum conductam Rhenum transisse ; hanc adfore biduo Ipsorum esse consilium , velintne priusquam finitimi sentiant eductos ex hibernis milites aut ad Ciceronem aut ad Labienum deducere , quorum alter milia passuum circiter quinquaginta , alter paulo amplius ab eis absit . <end>$$To the state moreover the occasion of the war was this-that it could not withstand the sudden combination of the Gauls ; that he could easily prove this from his own weakness , since he was not so little versed in affairs as to presume that with his forces he could conquer the Roman people ; but that it was the common resolution of Gaul ; that that day was appointed for the storming of all Caesar's winter-quarters , in order that no legion should be able to come to the relief of another legion , that Gauls could not easily deny Gauls , especially when a measure seemed entered into for recovering their common freedom .
<start> Arpineius et Iunius , quae audierunt , ad legatoc deferunt . <end>$$Arpineius and Junius relate to the legates what they had heard .
<start> Illi repentina re perturbati , etsi ab hoste ea dicebantur , tamen non neglegenda existimabant maximeque hac re permovebantur , quod civitatem ignobilem atque humilem Eburonum sua sponte populo Romano bellum facere ausam vix erat credendum . <end>$$They , greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair , though those things were spoken by an enemy , still thought they were not to be disregarded ; and they were especially influenced by this consideration , that it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the Eburones had dared to make war upon the Roman people of their own accord .
<start> Itaque ad consilium rem deferunt magnaque inter eos exsistit controversia . <end>$$Accordingly , they refer the matter to a council , and a great controversy arises among them .
<start> Lucius Aummculeius compluresque tribuni militum et primorum ordinum centuriones nihil temere agendum neque ex hibernis iniussu Caesaris discedendum existimabant : quantasvis copias etiam Germanorum sustineri posse munitis hibernis docebant : rem esse testimonio , quod primum hostium impetum multis ultro vulneribus illatis fortissime sustinuerint : re frumentaria non premi ; interea et ex proximis hibernis et a Caesare conventura subsidia : postremo quid esse levius aut turpius , quam auctore hoste de summis rebus capere consilium ?  . <end>$$Lucius Aurunculeius , and several tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions of the first rank , were of opinion that nothing should be done hastily , and that they should not depart from the camp without Caesar's orders ; they declared , that any forces of the Germans , however great , might be encountered by fortified winter-quarters ; that this fact was a proof ; that they had sustained the first assault of the Germans most valiantly , inflicting many wounds upon them ; that they were not distressed for corn ; that in the mean time relief would come both from the nearest winter-quarters and from Caesar ; lastly , they put the query , what could be more undetermined , more undignified , than to adopt measures respecting the most important affairs on the authority of an enemy ?  .
<start> Contra ea Titurius sero facturos clamitabat , cum maiores manus hostium adiunctis Germanis convenissent aut cum aliquid calamitatis in proximis hibernis esset acceptum Brevem consulendi esse occasionem Caesarem arbitrari profectum in Italiam ; neque aliter Calnutes interficiendi Tasgeti consilium fuisse capturos , neque Eburones , si ille adesset , tanta contemptione nostri ad castra venturos esse Non hostem auctorem , sed rem spectare : subesse Rhenum ; magno esse Germanis dolori Ariovisti mortem et superiores nostras victorias ; ardere Galliam tot contumeliis acceptis sub populi Romani imperium redactam superiore gloria rei militaris exstincta . <end>$$In opposition to those things , Titurius exclaimed , That they would do this too late , when greater forces of the enemy , after a junction with the Germans , should have assembled ; or when some disaster had been received in the neighboring winter-quarters ; that the opportunity for deliberating was short ; that he believed that Caesar had set forth into Italy , as the Carnutes would not otherwise have taken the measure of slaying Tasgetius , nor would the Eburones , if he had been present , have come to the camp with so great defiance of us ; that he did not regard the enemy , but the fact , as the authority ; that the Rhine was near ; that the death of Ariovistus and our previous victories were subjects of great indignation to the Germans ; that Gaul was inflamed , that after having received so many defeats she was reduced under the sway of the Roman people , her pristine glory in military matters being extinguished .
<start> Postremo quis hoc sibi persuaderet , sine certa re Ambiorigem ad eiusmodi consilium descendisse ? Suam sententiam in utramque partem esse tutam : si nihil esset durius , nullo cum periculo ad proximam legionem perventuros ; si Gallia omnis cum Germanis consentiret , unam esse in celeritate positam salutem . <end>$$Lastly , who would persuade himself of this , that Ambiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without sure grounds ? That his own opinion was safe on either side ; if there be nothing very formidable , they would go without danger to the nearest legion ; if all Gaul conspired with the Germans , their only safety lay in dispatch .
<start> Cottae quidem atque eorum , qui dissentirent , consilium quem habere exitum ? In quo si non praesens periculum , at certe longinqua obsidione fames esset timenda . <end>$$What issue would the advice of Cotta and of those who differed from him , have ? from which , if immediate danger was not to be dreaded , yet certainly famine , by a protracted siege , was .
<start> Hac in utramque partem disputatione habita , cum a Cotta primisque ordinibus acriter resisteretur , Vincite , inquit , si ita vultis , Sabinus , et id clariore voce , ut magna pars militum exaudiret ; neque is sum , inquit , qui gravissime ex vobis mortis periculo terrear : hi sapient ; si gravius quid acciderit , abs te rationem reposcent , qui , si per te liceat , perendino die cum proximis hibernis coniuncti communem cum reliquis belli casum sustineant , non reiecti et relegati longe ab ceteris aut ferro aut fame intereant . <end>$$This discussion having been held on the two sides , when opposition was offered strenuously by Cotta and the principal officers , Prevail , said Sabinus , if so you wish it ; and he said it with a louder voice , that a great portion of the soldiers might hear him ; nor am I the person among you , he said , who is most powerfully alarmed by the danger of death ; these will be aware of it , and then , if any thing disastrous shall have occurred , they will demand a reckoning at your hands ; these , who , if it were permitted by you , united three days hence with the nearest winter-quarters , may encounter the common condition of war with the rest , and not , as if forced away and separated far from the rest , perish either by the sword or by famine .
<start> Consurgitur ex consilio ; comprehendunt utrumque et orant , ne sua dissensione et pertinacia rem in summum periculum deducat : facilem esse rem , seu maneant , seu proficiscantur , si modo unum omnes sentiant ac probent ; contra in dissensione nullam se salutem perspicere . <end>$$They rise from the council , detain both , and entreat , that they do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their dissension and obstinacy ; the affair was an easy one , if only they all thought and approved of the same thing , whether they remain or depart ; on the other hand , they saw no security in dissension .
<start> Res disputatione ad mediam noctem perducitur . <end>$$The matter is prolonged by debate till midnight .
<start> Tandem dat Cotta permotus manus : superat sententia Sabini . <end>$$At last Cotta , being overruled , yields his assent ; the opinion of Sabinus prevails .
<start> Pronuntiatu prima luce ituros Consumitur vigiliis reliqua pars noctis , cum sua quisque miles circumspiceret , quic secum portare posset , quid ex instrumento hibernorum relinquere cogeretur Omnia excogitantur , quare nec sine periculo maneatur , et languore militulr et vigiLus periculum augeatur . <end>$$It is proclaimed that they will march at day-break ; the remainder of the night is spent without sleep , since every soldier was inspecting his property , what he could carry with him , and what , out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters , he would be compelled to leave ; every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay without danger , and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the soldiers and their want of sleep .
<start> Prima luce sic ex castris proficiscuntur , ut quibus esset persuas non ab hoste , sed ab homine amicissimo Ambiorige consilium datum , longissimo agmine maximisque impedimentis . <end>$$At break of day they quit the camp , in a very extended line and with a very large amount of baggage , in such a manner as men who were convinced that the advice was given by Ambiorix , not as an enemy , but as most friendly  .
<start> At hostes , posteaquam ex nocturno fremitu vigiliicque de profectione eorum senserunt , collocatis in sidus bipertito in silvis opportuno atque occulto loco a milibus passuum circiter duobus Romanorum adventum exspectabant , et cum se maior pars agminis in magnam convallem demisisset , ex utraque parte eius vallis subito se ostenderunt novissimosque premere et primos prohibere ascensu atque iniquissimo nostris loco proelium committere coeperunt . <end>$$But the enemy , after they had made the discovery of their intended departure by the noise during the night and their not retiring to rest , having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the woods , in a suitable and concealed place , two miles from the camp , waited for the arrival of the Romans : and when the greater part of the line of march had descended into a considerable valley , they suddenly presented themselves on either side of that valley , and began both to harass the rear and hinder the van from ascending , and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous to our men .
<start> Tum demum Titurius , qui nihil ante providisset , trepidare et concursare cohortesque disponere , haec tamen ipsa timide atque ut eum omnia deficere viderentur ; quod plerumque eis accidere consuevit , qui in ipso negotio consilium capere coguntur . <end>$$Then at length Titurius , as one who had provided nothing beforehand , was confused , ran to and fro , and set about arranging his troops ; these very things , however , he did timidly and in such a manner that all resources seemed to fail him : which generally happens to those who are compelled to take council in the action itself .
<start> At Cotta , qui cogitasset haec posse in itinere accidere atque ob eam causam profectionis auctor non fuisset , nulla in re communi saluti deerat et in appellandis cohortandisque miLtibus imperatoris et in pugna militis officia praestabat . <end>$$But Cotta , who had reflected that these things might occur on the march , and on that account had not been an adviser of the departure , was wanting to the common safety in no respect ; both in addressing and encouraging the soldiers , he performed the duties of a general , and in the battle those of a soldier .
<start> Cum propter longitudinem agminis minus facile omnia per se obire et , quid quoque loco faciendum esset , providere possent , iusserunt pronuntiare , ut impedimenta relinquerent atque in orbem consisterent Quod consilium etsi in eiusmodi casu reprehendendum non est , tarmen incommode accidit : nam et nostris militibus spem minuit et hostes ad pugnam alacriores effecit , quod non sine summo timore et desperatione id factum videbatur . <end>$$And since they could less easily perform every thing by themselves , and provide what was to be done in each place , by reason of the length of the line of march , they ordered to give the command that they should leave the baggage and form themselves into an orb , which measure , though in a contingency of that nature it was not to be condemned , still turned out unfortunately ; for it both diminished the hope of our soldiers and rendered the enemy more eager for the fight , because it appeared that this was not done without the greatest fear and despair .
<start> Praeterea accidit , quod fieri necesse erat , ut vulgo milites ab signis discederent , quae quisque eorum carissima haberet , ab impedimentis petere atque arripere properaret , clamore et fletu omnia complerentur . <end>$$Besides that happened , which would necessarily be the case , that the soldiers for the most part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry off from the baggage whatever each thought valuable , and all parts were filled with uproar and lamentation .
<start> At barbaris consilium non defuit Nam duces eorum tota acie pronuntiare iusserunt , ne quis ab loco discederet : illorum esse praedam atque illis reservari quaecumque Romani reliquissent : proinde omnia in victoria posita existimarent . <end>$$But judgment was not wanting to the barbarians ; for their leaders ordered to proclaim through the ranks that no man should quit his place ; that the booty was theirs , and for them was reserved whatever the Romans should leave ; therefore let them consider that all things depended on their victory .
<start> Erant et virtute et studio pugnandi pares ; nostri , tametsi ab duce et a fortuna deserebantur , tamen omnem spem salutis in virtute ponebant , et quotiens quaeque cohors procurrerat , ab ea parte magnus numerus hostium cadebat . <end>$$Our men were equal to them in fighting , both in courage and in number , and though they were deserted by their leader and by fortune , yet they still placed all hope of safety in their valor , and as often as any cohort sallied forth on that side , a great number of the enemy usually fell .
<start> Qua re animadversa Ambiorix pronuntiari iubet , ut procul tela coniciant neu propius accedant et , quam in partem Romani impetum fecerint , cedant (levitate armorum et cotidiana exercitatione nihil eis noceri posse) , rursus se ad signa recipientes insequantur . <end>$$Ambiorix , when he observed this , orders the command to be issued that they throw their weapons from a distance and do not approach too near , and in whatever direction the Romans should make an attack , there give way ; pursue them when betaking themselves to their standards again .
<start> Quo praecepto ab eis diligentissime observato , cum quaepiam cohors ex orbe excesserat atque impetum fecerat , hostes velocissime refugiebant . <end>$$Which command having been most carefully obeyed , when any cohort had quitted the circle and made a charge , the enemy fled very precipitately .
<start> Rursus cum in eum locum unde erant egressi reverti coeperant , et ab eis qui cesserant et ab eis qui proximi steterant circumveniebantur ; sin autem locum tenere vellent , nec virtuti locus relinquebatur , neque ab tanta multitudine coniecta tela conferti vitare poterant . <end>$$Yet , though assailed by so many disadvantages , having received many wounds , they withstood the enemy , and , a great portion of the day being spent , though they fought from day-break till the eighth hour , they did nothing which was unworthy of them .
<start> Tamen tot incommodis conflictati , multis vulneribus acceptis resistebant et magna parte diei consumpta , cum a prima luce ad horam octavam pugnaretur , nihil quod ipsis esset indignum committebant . <end>$$At length , each thigh of T Balventius , who the year before had been chief centurion , a brave man and one of great authority , is pierced with a javelin ; Q Lucanius , of the same rank , fighting most valiantly , is slain while he assists his son when surrounded by the enemy ; L .
<start> His rebus permotus Quintus Titurius , cum procul Ambiorigem suos cohortantem conspexisset , interpretem suum Gnaeum Pompeium ad eum mittit rogatum ut sibi militibusque parcat . <end>$$Much troubled by these events , Q Titurius , when he had perceived Ambiorix in the distance encouraging his men , sends to him his interpreter , Cn .
<start> Ille appellatus respondit : si velit secum colloqui , licere ; sperare a multitudine impetrari posse , quod ad militum salutem pertineat ; ipsi vero nihil nocitum iri , inque eam rem se suam fidem interponere . <end>$$Pompey , to beg that he would spare him and his soldiers He , when addressed , replied , If he wishes to confer with him , it was permitted ; that he hoped what pertained to the safety of the soldiers could be obtained from the people ; that to him however certainly no injury would be done , and that he pledged his faith to that effect .
<start> Ille cum Cotta saucio communicat , si videatur , pugna ut excedant et cum Ambiorige una colloquantur : sperare ab eo de sua ac militum salute impetrari posse . <end>$$He consults with Cotta , who had been wounded , whether it would appear right to retire from battle , and confer with Ambiorix ; that he hoped to be able to succeed respecting his own and the soldiers' safety .
<start> Cotta se ad armatum hostem iturum negat atque in eo perseverat . <end>$$Cotta says he will not go to an armed enemy , and in that perseveres .
<start> Sabinus quos in praesentia tribunos militum circum se habebat et primorum ordinum centuriones se sequi iubet et , cum propius Ambiorigem accessisset , iussus arma abicere imperatum facit suisque ut idem faciant imperat . <end>$$Sabinus orders those tribunes of the soldiers whom he had at the time around him , and the centurions of the first ranks , to follow him , and when he had approached near to Ambiorix , being ordered to throw down his arms , he obeys the order and commands his men to do the same .
<start> Interim , dum de condicionibus inter se agunt longiorque consulto ab Ambiorige instituitur sermo , paulatim circumventus interficitur . <end>$$In the mean time , while they treat upon the terms , and a longer debate than necessary is designedly entered into by Ambiorix , being surrounded by degrees , he is slain .
<start> Tum vero suo more victoriam conclamant atque ululatum tollunt impetuque in nostros facto ordines perturbant . <end>$$Then they , according to their custom , shout out Victory , and raise their war-cry , and , making an attack on our men , break their ranks .
<start> Ex quibus Lucius Petrosidius aquilifer , cum magna multitudine hostium premeretur , aquilam intra vallum proiecit ; ipse pro castris fortissime pugnans occiditur . <end>$$Petrosidius , the standard bearer , when he was overpowered by the great number of the enemy , threw the eagle within the intrenchments and is himself slain while fighting with the greatest courage before the camp .
<start> Illi aegre ad noctem oppugnationem sustinent ; noctu ad unum omnes desperata salute se ipsi interficiunt . <end>$$They with difficulty sustain the attack till night ; despairing of safety , they all to a man destroy themselves in the night .
<start> Pauci ex proelio lapsi incertis itineribus per silvas ad Titum Labienum legatum in hiberna perveniunt atque eum de rebus gestis certiorem faciunt . <end>$$A few escaping from the battle , made their way to Labienus at winter-quarters , after wandering at random through the woods , and inform him of these events .
<start> Hac victoria sublatus Ambiorix statim cum equitatu in Aduatucos , qui erant eius regno finitimi , proficiscitur ; neque noctem neque diem intermittit peditatumque subsequi iubet . <end>$$Elated by this victory , Ambiorix marches immediately with his cavalry to the Aduatuci , who bordered on his kingdom ; he halts neither day nor night , and orders the infantry to follow him closely .
<start> Re demonstrata Aduatucisque concitatis postero die in Nervios pervenit hortaturque , ne sui in perpetuum liberandi atque ulciscendi Romanos pro eis quas acceperint iniuriis occasionem dimittant : interfectos esse legatos duos magnamque partem exercitus interisse demonstrat ; nihil esse negoti subito oppressam legionem quae cum Cicerone hiemet interfici ; se ad eam rem profitetur adiutorem . <end>$$Having related the exploit and roused the Aduatuci , the next day he arrived among the Nervii , and entreats that they should not throw away the opportunity of liberating themselves forever and of punishing the Romans for those wrongs which they had received from them ; that two lieutenants have been slain , and that a large portion of the army has perished ; that it was not a matter of difficulty for the legion which was wintering with Cicero to be cut off , when suddenly assaulted ; he declares himself ready to cooperate in that design .
<start> Facile hac oratione Nerviis persuadet . <end>$$He easily gains over the Nervii by this speech .
<start> Itaque confestim dimissis nuntiis ad Ceutrones , Grudios , Levacos , Pleumoxios , Geidumnos , qui omnes sub eorum imperio sunt , quam maximas manus possunt cogunt et de improviso ad Ciceronis hiberna advolant nondum ad eum fama de Tituri morte perlata . <end>$$Accordingly , messengers having been forthwith dispatched to the Centrones , the Grudii , the Levaci , the Pleumoxii , and the Geiduni , all of whom are under their government , they assemble as large bodies as they can , and rush unexpectedly to the winter-quarters of Cicero , the report of the death of Titurius not having as yet been conveyed to him .
<start> Huic quoque accidit , quod fuit necesse , ut nonnulli milites , qui lignationis munitionisque causa in silvas discessissent , repentino equitum adventu interciperentur . <end>$$That also occurred to him , which was the consequence of a necessary work-that some soldiers who had gone off into the woods for the purpose of procuring timber and therewith constructing fortifications , were intercepted by the sudden arrival of horse .
<start> His circumventis magna manu Eburones , Nervii , Aduatuci atque horum omnium socii et clientes legionem oppugnare incipiunt Nostri celeriter ad arma concurrunt , vallum conscendunt Aegre is dies sustentatur , quod omnem spem hostes in celeritate ponebant atque hanc adepti victoriam in perpetuum se fore victores confidebant . <end>$$These having been entrapped , the Eburones , the Nervii , and the Aduatici and all their allies and dependents , begin to attack the legion : our men quickly run together to arms and mount the rampart ; they sustained the attack that day with great difficulty , since the enemy placed all their hope in dispatch , and felt assured that , if they obtained this victory , they would be conquerors forever .
<start> Mittuntur ad Caesarem confestim ab Cicerone litterae magnis propositis praemiis , si pertulissent : obsessis omnibus viis missi intercipiuntur . <end>$$Letters are immediately sent to Caesar by Cicero , great rewards being offered if they carried them through .
<start> Nulla pars nocturni temporis ad laborem intermittitur ; non aegris , non vulneratis facultas quietis datur . <end>$$Resistance is made by our men in the same manner as the day before ; this same thing is done afterward during the remaining days .
<start> Quaecumque ad proximi diei oppugnationem opus sunt noctu comparantur ; multae praeustae sudes , magnus muralium pilorum numerus instituitur ; turres contabulantur , pinnae loricaeque ex cratibus attexuntur . <end>$$The work is carried on incessantly in the night : not even to the sick , or wounded , is opportunity given for rest : whatever things are required for resisting the assault of the next day are provided during the night : many stakes burned at the end , and a large number of mural pikes are procured : towers are built up , battlements and parapets are formed of interwoven hurdles .
<start> Ipse Cicero , cum tenuissima valetudine esset , ne nocturnum quidem sibi tempus ad quietem relinquebat , ut ultro militum concursu ae vocibus sibi parcere cogeretur . <end>$$Cicero himself , though he was in very weak health , did not leave himself the night-time for repose , so that he was forced to spare himself by the spontaneous movement and entreaties of the soldiers .
<start> Tunc duces principesque Nerviorum qui aliquem cermonis aditum causamque amicitiae cum Cicerone habebant colloqui sese velle dicunt . <end>$$Then these leaders and chiefs of the Nervii , who had any intimacy and grounds of friendship with Cicero , say they desire to confer with him .
<start> Facta potestate eadem quae Ambiorix cum Titurio egerat commemorant : omnem esse in armis Galliam ; Germanos Rhenum transisse ; Caesaris reliquorumque hiberna oppugnari . <end>$$When permission was granted , they recount the same things which Ambiorix had related to Titurius , namely , that all Gaul was in arms , that the Germans had passed the Rhine , that the winter-quarters of Caesar and of the others were attacked .
<start> Addunt etiam de Sabini morte : Ambiorigem ostentant fidei faciendae causa . <end>$$They report in addition also , about the death of Sabinus .
<start> Errare eos dicunt , si quidquam ab his praesidi sperent , qui suis rebus diffidant ; sese tamen hoc esse in Ciceronem populumque Romanum animo , ut nihil nisi hiberna recusent atque hanc inveterascere consuetudinem nolint : licere illis incolumibus per se ex hibernis discedere et quascumque in partes velint sine metu proficisci . <end>$$They point to Ambiorix for the purpose of obtaining credence ; they are mistaken , say they , if they hoped for any relief from those who distrust their own affairs ; that they bear such feelings toward Cicero and the Roman people that they deny them nothing but winter-quarters , and are unwilling that the practice should become constant ; that through their means it is possible for them to depart from their winter-quarters safely and to proceed without fear into whatever parts they desire .
<start> Cicero ad haec unum modo respondit : non esse consuetudinem populi Romani accipere ab hoste armato condicionem : si ab armis discedere velint , se adiutore utantur legatosque ad Caesarem mittant ; sperare pro eius iustitia , quae petierint , impetraturos . <end>$$To these Cicero made only one reply : that it is not the custom of the Roman people to accept any condition from an armed enemy : if they are willing to lay down their arms , they may employ him as their advocate and send embassadors to Caesar : that he believed , from his justice , they would obtain the things which they might request .
<start> Ab hac spe repulsi Nervii vallo pedum IX et fossa pedum XV hiberna cingunt . <end>$$Disappointed in this hope , the Nervii surround the winter-quarters with a rampart eleven feet high , and a ditch thirteen feet in depth .
<start> Haec et superiorum annorum consuetudine ab nobis cognoverant et , quos clam de exercitu habebant captivos , ab eis docebantur ; sed nulla ferramentorum copia quae esset ad hunc usum idonea , gladiis caespites circumcidere , manibus sagulisque terram exhaurire nitebantur Qua quidem ex re hominum multitudo cognosci potuit : nam minus horis tribus milium pedum XV in circuitu munitionem perfecerunt reliquisque diebus turres ad altitudinem valli , falces testudinesque , quas idem captivi docuerant , parare ac facere coeperunt . <end>$$These military works they had learned from our men in the intercourse of former years , and , having taken some of our army prisoners , were instructed by them : but , as they had no supply of iron tools which are requisite for this service , they were forced to cut the turf with their swords , and to empty out the earth with their hands and cloaks , from which circumstance , the vast number of the men could be inferred ; for in less than three hours they completed a fortification of ten miles in circumference ; and during the rest of the days they began to prepare and construct towers of the height of the ramparts , and grappling irons , and mantelets , which the same prisoners had taught them .
<start> Septimo oppugnationis die maximo coorto vento ferventes fusili ex argilla glandes fundis et fervefacta iacula in casas , quae more Gallico stramentis erant tectae , iacere coeperunt . <end>$$On the seventh day of the attack , a very high wind having risen up , they began to throw by their slings hot bullets made of softened clay , and heated javelins , upon the huts , which , after the Gallic custom , were thatched with straw .
<start> Hae celeriter ignem comprehenderunt et venti magnitudine in omnem locum castrorum distulerunt . <end>$$These quickly took fire , and by the violence of the wind , scattered their flames in every part of the camp .
<start> Hostes maximo clamore sicuti parta iam atque explorata victoria turres testudinesque agere et scalis vallum ascendere coeperunt . <end>$$The enemy following up their success with a very loud shout , as if victory were already obtained and secured , began to advance their towers and mantelets , and climb the rampart with ladders .
<start> At tanta militum virtus atque ea praesentia animi fuit , ut , cum undique flamma torrerentur maximaque telorum multitudine premerentur suaque omnia impedimenta atque omnes fortunas conflagrare intellegerent , non modo demigrandi causa de vallo decederet nemo , sed paene ne respiceret quidem quisquam , ac tum omnes acerrime fortissimeque pugnarent . <end>$$But so great was the courage of our soldiers , and such their presence of mind , that though they were scorched on all sides , and harassed by a vast number of weapons , and were aware that their baggage and their possessions were burning , not only did no one quit the rampart for the purpose of withdrawing from the scene , but scarcely did any one even then look behind ; and they all fought most vigorously and most valiantly .
<start> Hic dies nostris longe gravissimus fuit ; sed tamen hunc habuit eventum , ut eo die maximus numerus hostium vulneraretur atque interficeretur , ut se sub ipso vallo constipaverant recessumque primis ultimi non dabant . <end>$$This day was by far the most calamitous to our men ; it had this result , however , that on that day the largest number of the enemy was wounded and slain , since they had crowded beneath the very rampart , and the hindmost did not afford the foremost a retreat .
<start> Paulum quidem intermissa flamma et quodam loco turri adacta et contingente vallum tertiae cohortis centuriones ex eo , quo stabant , loco recesserunt suosque omnes removerunt , nutu vocibusque hostes , si introire vellent , vocare coeperunt ; quorum progredi ausus est nemo . <end>$$The flame having abated a little , and a tower having been brought up in a particular place and touching the rampart , the centurions of the third cohort retired from the place in which they were standing , and drew off all their men : they began to call on the enemy by gestures and by words , to enter if they wished ; but none of them dared to advance .
<start> Tum ex omni parte lapidibus coniectis deturbati , turrisque succensa est . <end>$$Then stones having been cast from every quarter , the enemy were dislodged , and their tower set on fire .
<start> Erant in ea legione fortissimi viri , centuriones , qui primis ordinibus appropinquarent , Titus Pullo et Lucius Vorenus . <end>$$In that legion there were two very brave men , centurions , who were now approaching the first ranks , T .
<start> Hi perpetuas inter se controversias habebant , quinam anteferretur , omnibusque annis de locis summis simultatibus contendebant . <end>$$Pullo , and L Vorenus These used to have continual disputes between them which of them should be preferred , and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity .
<start> Ex his Pullo , cum acerrime ad munitiones pugnaretur , Quid dubitas , inquit , Vorene ? aut quem locum tuae probandae virtutis exspectas  ? hic dies de nostris controversiis iudicabit . <end>$$When the fight was going on most vigorously before the fortifications , Pullo , one of them , says , Why do you hesitate , Vorenus ? or what opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek ? This very day shall decide our disputes .
<start> Haec cum dixisset , procedit extra munitiones quaque pars hostium confertissma est visa irrumpit . <end>$$When he had uttered these words , he proceeds beyond the fortifications , and rushes on that part of the enemy which appeared the thickest .
<start> Ne Vorenus quidem tum sese vallo continet , sed omnium veritus existi mationem subsequitur . <end>$$Nor does Vorenus remain within the rampart , but respecting the high opinion of all , follows close after .
<start> Mediocri spatio relicto Pullo pilum in hostes immittit atque unum ex multitudine procurrentem traicit ; quo percusso et exanimato hunc scutis protegunt , in hostem tela universi coniciunt neque dant regrediendi facultatem . <end>$$Then , when an inconsiderable space intervened , Pullo throws his javelin at the enemy , and pierces one of the multitude who was running up , and while the latter was wounded and slain , the enemy cover him with their shields , and all throw their weapons at the other and afford him no opportunity of retreating .
<start> Transfigitur scutum Pulloni et verutum in balteo defigitur . <end>$$The shield of Pullo is pierced and a javelin is fastened in his belt .
<start> Avertit hic casus vaginam et gladium educere conanti dextram moratur manum , impeditumque hostes circumsistunt . <end>$$This circumstance turns aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting to draw his sword : the enemy crowd around him when embarrassed .
<start> Succurrit inimicus illi Vorenus et laboranti subvenit . <end>$$His rival runs up to him and succors him in this emergency .
<start> Ad hunc se confestim a Pullone omnis multitudo convertit : illum veruto arbitrantur occisum . <end>$$Immediately the whole host turn from Pullo to him , supposing the other to be pierced through by the javelin .
<start> Gladio comminus rem gerit Vorenus atque uno interfecto reliquos paulum propellit ; dum cupidius instat , in locum deiectus inferiorem concidit . <end>$$Vorenus rushes on briskly with his sword and carries on the combat hand to hand , and having slain one man , for a short time drove back the rest : while he urges on too eagerly , slipping into a hollow , he fell .
<start> Huic rursus circumvento fert subsidium Pullo , atque ambo incolumes compluribus interfectis summa cum laude sese intra munitiones recipiunt . <end>$$To him , in his turn , when surrounded , Pullo brings relief ; and both having slain a great number , retreat into the fortifications amid the highest applause .
<start> Sic fortuna in contentione et certamine utrumque versavit , ut alter alteri inimicus auxilio salutique esset , neque diiudicari posset , uter utri virtute anteferendus videretur . <end>$$Fortune so dealt with both in this rivalry and conflict , that the one competitor was a succor and a safeguard to the other , nor could it be determined which of the two appeared worthy of being preferred to the other .
<start> Quanto erat in dies gravior atque asperior oppugnatio , et maxime quod magna parte militum confecta vulneribus res ad paucitatem defensorum pervenerat , tanto crebriores litterae nuntiique ad Caesarem mittebantur ; quorum pars deprehensa in conspectu nostrorum militum cum cruciatu necabatur . <end>$$In proportion as the attack became daily more formidable and violent , and particularly , because , as a great number of the soldiers were exhausted with wounds , the matter had come to a small number of defenders , more frequent letters and messages were sent to Caesar ; a part of which messengers were taken and tortured to death in the sight of our soldiers .
<start> Erat unus intus Nervius nomine Vertico , loco natus honesto , qui a prima obsidione ad Ciceronem perfugerat suamque ei fidem praestiterat . <end>$$There was within our camp a certain Nervian , by name Vertico , born in a distinguished position , who in the beginning of the blockade had deserted to Cicero , and had exhibited his fidelity to him .
<start> Hic servo spe libertatis magnisque persuadet praemiis , ut litteras ad Caesarem deferat . <end>$$He persuades his slave , by the hope of freedom , and by great rewards , to convey a letter to Caesar .
<start> Has ille in iaculo illigatas effert et Gallus inter Gallos sine ulla suspicione versatus ad Caesarem pervenit . <end>$$This he carries out bound about his javelin ; and mixing among the Gauls without any suspicion by being a Gaul , he reaches Caesar .
<start> Ab eo de periculis Ciceronis legionisque cognoscitur . <end>$$From him they received information of the imminent danger of Cicero and the legion .
<start> Caesar acceptis litteris hora circiter Xl diei statim nuntium in Bellovacos ad Marcus Crassum quaestorem mittit , cuius hiberna aberant ab eo milia passuum XXV ; iubet media nocte legionem proficisci celeriterque ad se venire . <end>$$Caesar having received the letter about the eleventh hour of the day , immediately sends a messenger to the Bellovaci , to M .
<start> Scribit Labieno , si rei publicae commodo facere posset , cum legione ad fines Nerviorum veniat . <end>$$Fabius , the lieutenant , ordering him to lead forth his legion into the territories of the Atrebates , to which he knew his march must be made .
<start> Hora circiter tertia ab antecursoribus de Crassi adventu certior factus eo die milia passuum XX procedit . <end>$$Having been apprised of the arrival of Crassus by the scouts at about the third hour , he advances twenty miles that day .
<start> Crassum Samarobrivae praeficit legionemque attribuit , quod ibi impedimenta exercitus , obsides civitatum , litteras publicas frumentumque omne quod eo tolerandae hiemis causa devexerat relinquebat . <end>$$He appoints Crassus over Samarobriva and assigns him a legion , because he was leaving there the baggage of the army , the hostages of the states , the public documents , and all the corn , which he had conveyed thither for passing the winter .
<start> Fabius , ut imperatum erat , non ita multum moratus in itinere cum legione occurrit . <end>$$Fabius , without delaying a moment , meets him on the march with his legion , as he had been commanded .
<start> Labienus interitu Sabini et caede cohortium cognita , cum omnes ad eum Treverorum copiae venissent , veritus , si ex hibernis fugae similem profectionem fecisset , ut hostium impetum sustinere posset , praesertim quos recenti victoria efferri sciret , litteras Caesari remittit , quanto cum periculo legionem ex hibernis educturus esset ; rem gestam in Eburonibus perscribit ; docet omnes equitatus peditatusque copias Treverorum tria milia passuum longe ab suis castris consedisse . <end>$$Labienus , having learned the death of Sabinus and the destruction of the cohorts , as all the forces of the Treviri had come against him , beginning to fear lest , if he made a departure from his winter-quarters , resembling a flight , he should not be able to support the attack of the enemy , particularly since he knew them to be elated by their recent victory , sends back a letter to Caesar , informing him with what great hazard he would lead out his legion from winter-quarters ; he relates at large the affairs which had taken place among the Eburones ; he informs him that all the infantry and cavalry of the Treviri had encamped at a distance of only three miles from his own camp .
<start> Caesar consilio eius probato , etsi opinione trium legionum deiectus ad duas redierat , tamen unum communis salutis auxilium in celeritate ponebat . <end>$$Caesar , approving of his motives , although he was disappointed in his expectation of three legions , and reduced to two , yet placed his only hopes of the common safety in dispatch .
<start> Venit magnis itineribus in Nerviorum fines . <end>$$He goes into the territories of the Nervii by long marches .
<start> Ibi ex captivis cognoscit , quae apud Ciceronem gerantur , quantoque in periculo res sit . <end>$$There he learns from some prisoners what things are going on in the camp of Cicero , and in how great jeopardy the affair is .
<start> Tum cuidam ex equitibus Gallis magnis praemiis persuadet uti ad Ciceronem epistolam deferat . <end>$$Then with great rewards he induces a certain man of the Gallic horse to convey a letter to Cicero .
<start> Hanc Graecis conscriptam litteris mittit , ne intercepta epistola nostra ab hostibus consilia cognoscantur . <end>$$This he sends written in Greek characters , lest the letter being intercepted , our measures should be discovered by the enemy .
<start> Si adire non possit , monet ut tragulam cum epistola ad amentum deligata intra munitionem castrorum abiciat . <end>$$He directs him , if he should be unable to enter , to throw his spear with the letter fastened to the thong , inside the fortifications of the camp .
<start> In litteris scribit se cum legionibus profectum celeriter adfore ; hortatur ut pristinam virtutem retineat . <end>$$He writes in the letter , that he having set out with his legions , will quickly be there : he entreats him to maintain his ancient valor .
<start> Gallus periculum veritus , ut erat praeceptum , tragulam mittit . <end>$$The Gaul apprehending danger , throws his spear as he has been directed .
<start> Haec casu ad turrim adhaesit neque ab nostris biduo animadversa tertio die a quodam milite conspicitur , dempta ad Ciceronem defertur . <end>$$Is by chance stuck in a tower , and , not being observed by our men for two days , was seen by a certain soldier on the third day : when taken down , it was carried to Cicero .
<start> Ille perlectam in conventu militum recitat maximaque omnes laetitia adficit . <end>$$He , after perusing it , reads it out in an assembly of the soldiers , and fills all with the greatest joy .
<start> Tum fumi incendiorum procul videbantur ; quae res omnem dubitationem adventus legionum expulit . <end>$$Then the smoke of the fires was seen in the distance , a circumstance which banished all doubt of the arrival of the legions .
<start> Galli re cognita per exploratores obsidionem relinquunt , ad Caesarem omnibus copiis contendunt . <end>$$The Gauls , having discovered the matter through their scouts , abandon the blockade , and march toward Caesar with all their forces ; these were about 60 , 000 armed men .
<start> Cicero data facultate Gallum ab eodem Verticone , quem supra demonstravimus , repetit , qui litteras ad Caesarem deferat ; hunc admonet , iter caute diligenterque faciat : perscribit in litteris hostes ab se discessisse omnemque ad eum multitudinem convertisse . <end>$$When this letter was brought to him about the middle of the night , Caesar apprises his soldiers of its contents , and inspires them with courage for fighting : the following day , at the dawn , he moves his camp , and , having proceeded four miles , he espies the forces of the enemy on the other side of a considerable valley and rivulet .
<start> Quibus litteris circiter media nocte Caesar adlatis suos facit certiores eosque ad dimicandum animo confirmat . <end>$$It was an affair of great danger to fight with such large forces in a disadvantageous situation .
<start> Postero die luce prima movet castra et circiter milia passuum quattuor progressus trans vallem et rivum multitudinem hostium conspicatur . <end>$$For the present , therefore , inasmuch as he knew that Cicero was released from the blockade , and thought that he might , on that account , relax his speed , he halted there and fortifies a camp in the most favorable position he can .
<start> Erat magni periculi res tantulis copiis iniquo loco dimicare ; tum , quoniam obsidione liberatum Ciceronem sciebat , aequo animo remittendum de celeritate existimabat : consedit et quam aequissimo loco potest castra communit atque haec , etsi erant exigua per se vix hominum milium septem praesertim nullis cum impedimentis , tamen angustiis viarum quam maxime potest contrahit , eo consilio , ut in summam contemptionem hostibus veniat . <end>$$And this , though it was small in itself , scarcely 7 , 000 men , and these too without baggage , still by the narrowness of the passages , he contracts as much as he can , with this object , that he may come into the greatest contempt with the enemy .
<start> Interim speculatoribus in omnes partes dimissis explorat quo commodissime itinere vallem transire possit . <end>$$In the mean while scouts having been sent in all directions , he examines by what most convenient path he might cross the valley .
<start> Eo die parvulis equestribus proeliis ad aquam factis utrique sese suo loco continent : Galli , quod ampliores copias , quae nondum convenerant , exspectabant ; Caesar , si forte timoris simulatione hostes in suum locum elicere posset , ut citra vallem pro castris proelio contenderet , si id efficere non posset , ut exploratis itineribus minore cum periculo vallem rivumque transiret . <end>$$That day , slight skirmishes of cavalry having taken place near the river , both armies kept in their own positions : the Gauls , because they were awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived ; Caesar , if perchance by pretense of fear he could allure the enemy toward his position , so that he might engage in battle , in front of his camp , on this side of the valley ; if he could not accomplish this , that , having inquired about the passes , he might cross the valley and the river with the less hazard .
<start> Prima luce hostium equitatus ad castra accedit proeliumque cum nostris equitibus committit . <end>$$At daybreak the cavalry of the enemy approaches to the camp and joins battle with our horse .
<start> Caesar consulto equites cedere seque in castra recipere iubet , simul ex omnibus partibus castra altiore vallo muniri portasque obstrui atque in his administrandis rebus quam maxime concursari et cum simulatione agi timoris iubet . <end>$$Caesar orders the horse to give way purposely , and retreat to the camp : at the same time he orders the camp to be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions , the gates to be barricaded , and in executing these things as much confusion to be shown as possible , and to perform them under the pretense of fear .
<start> Quibus omnibus rebus hostes invitati copias traducunt aciemque iniquo loco constituunt , nostris vero etiam de vallo deductis propius accedunt et tela intra munitionem ex omnibus partibus coniciunt praeconibusque circummissis pronuntiari iubent , seu quis Gallus seu Romanus velit ante horam tertiam ad se transire , sine periculo licere ; post id tempus non fore potestatem : ac sic nostros contempserunt , ut obstructis in speciem portis singulis ordinibus caespitum , quod ea non posse introrumpere videbantur , alii vallum manu scindere , alii fossas complere inciperent . <end>$$Induced by all these things , the enemy lead over their forces and draw up their line in a disadvantageous position ; and as our men also had been led down from the ramparts , they approach nearer , and throw their weapons into the fortification from all sides , and sending heralds round , order it to be proclaimed that , if any , either Gaul or Roman , was willing to go over to them before the third hour , it was permitted ; after that time there would not be permission ; and so much did they disregard our men , that the gates having been blocked up with single rows of turf as a mere appearance , because they did not seem able to burst in that way , some began to pull down the rampart with their hands , others to fill up the trenches .
<start> Tum Caesar omnibus portis eruptione facta equitatuque emisso celeriter hostes in fugam dat , sic uti omnino pugnandi causa resisteret nemo , magnumque ex eis numerum occidit atque omnes armis exuit . <end>$$Then Caesar , making a sally from all the gates , and sending out the cavalry , soon puts the enemy to flight , so that no one at all stood his ground with the intention of fighting ; and he slew a great number of them , and deprived all of their arms .
<start> Longius prosequi veritus , quod silvae paludesque intercedebant neque etiam parvulo detrimento illorum locum relinqui videbat , omnibus suis incolumibus copiis eodem die ad Ciceronem pervenit . <end>$$Caesar , fearing to pursue them very far , because woods and morasses intervened , and also he saw that they suffered no small loss in abandoning their position , reaches Cicero the same day with all his forces safe .
<start> Institutas turres , testudines munitionesque hostium admiratur ; legione producta cognoscit non decimum quemque esse reliquum militem sine vulnere : ex his omnibus iudicat rebus , quanto cum periculo et quanta cum virtute res sint administratae . <end>$$He witnesses with surprise the towers , mantelets , and fortifications belonging to the enemy : the legion having been drawn out , he finds that even every tenth soldier had not escaped without wounds .
<start> Ciceronem pro eius merito leg , ionemque collaudat ; centuriones singillatim tribunosquc militum appellat , quorum egregiam fuisse virtutem testimonio Ciceronis cognoverat . <end>$$From all these things he judges with what danger and with what great courage matters had been conducted ; he commends Cicero according to his desert , and likewise the legion ; he addresses individually the centurions and the tribunes of the soldiers , whose valor he had discovered to have been signal .
<start> De casu Sabini et Cottae certius ex captivis cognoscit . <end>$$He receives information of the death of Sabinus and Cotta from the prisoners .
<start> Postero die contione habita rem gestam proponit , milites consolatur et confirmat : quod detrimentum culpa et temeritate legati sit acceptum , hoc aequiore animo ferendum docet , quod beneficio deorum immortalium et virtute eorum expiato incommodo neque hostibus diutina laetatio neque ipsis longior dolor relinquatur . <end>$$An assembly being held the following day , he states the occurrence ; he consoles and encourages the soldiers ; he suggests , that the disaster , which had been occasioned by the misconduct and rashness of his lieutenant , should be borne with a patient mind , because by the favor of the immortal gods and their own valor , neither was lasting joy left to the enemy , nor very lasting grief to them .
<start> Interim ad Labienum per Remos incredibili celeritate de victoria Caesaris fama perfertur , ut , cum ab hibernis Ciceronis milia passuum abesset circiter LX , eoque post horam nonam diei Caesar pervenisset , ante mediam noctem ad portas castrorum clamor oreretur , quo clamore significatio victoriae gratulatioque ab Remis Labieno fieret . <end>$$In the mean while the report respecting the victory of Caesar is conveyed to Labienus through the country of the Remi with incredible speed , so that , though he was about sixty miles distant from the winter-quarter of Cicero , and Caesar had arrived there after the ninth hour , before midnight a shout arose at the gates of the camp , by which shout an indication of the victory and a congratulation on the part of the Remi were given to Labienus .
<start> Hac fama ad Treveros perlata Indutiomarus , qui postero die castra Labieni oppugnare decreverat , noctu profugit copiasque omnes in Treveros reducit . <end>$$This report having been carried to the Treviri , Indutiomarus , who had resolved to attack the camp of Labienus the following day , flies by night and leads back all his forces into the country of the Treviri .
<start> Caesar Fabium cum sua legione remittit in hiberna , ipse cum tribus legionibus circum Samarobrivam trinis hibernis hiemare constituit et , quod tanti motus Galliae exstiterant , totam hiemem ipse ad exercitum manere decrevit . <end>$$Caesar sends back Fabius with his legion to his winter-quarters ; he himself determines to winter with three legions near Samarobriva in three different quarters , and , because such great commotions had arisen in Gaul , he resolved to remain during the whole winter with the army himself .
<start> Nam illo incommodo de Sabini morte perlato omnes fere Galliae civitates de bello consultabant , nuntios legationesque in omnes partes dimittebant et quid reliqui consili caperent atque unde initium belli fieret explorabant nocturnaque in locis desertis concilia habebant . <end>$$For the disaster respecting the death of Sabinus having been circulated among them , almost all the states of Gaul were deliberating about war , sending messengers and embassies into all quarters , inquiring what further measure they should take , and holding councils by night in secluded places .
<start> Neque ullum fere totius hiemis tempus sine sollicitudine Caesaris intercessit , quin aliquem de consiliis ac motu Gallorum nuntium acciperet . <end>$$Nor did any period of the whole winter pass over without fresh anxiety to Caesar , or , without his receiving some intelligence respecting the meetings and commotions of the Gauls .
<start> In his ab Lucio Roscio , quem legioni tertiae decimae praefecerat , certior factus est magnas Gallorum copias earum civitatum , quae Armoricae appellantur , oppugnandi sui causa convenisse neque longius milia passuum octo ab hibernis suis afuisse , sed nuntio allato de victoria Caesaris discessisse , adeo ut fugae similis discessus videretur . <end>$$Among these , he is informed by L Roscius , the lieutenant whom he had placed over the thirteenth legion , that large forces of those states of the Gauls , which are called the Armoricae , had assembled for the purpose of attacking him and were not more than eight miles distant ; but intelligence respecting the victory of Caesar being carried , had retreated in such a manner that their departure appeared like a flight .
<start> At Caesar principibus cuiusque civitatis ad se evocatis alias territando , cum se scire quae fierent denuntiaret , alias cohortando magnam partem Galliae in offiicio tenuit . <end>$$But Caesar , having summoned to him the principal persons of each state , in one case by alarming them , since he declared that he knew what was going on , and in another case by encouraging them , retained a great part of Gaul in its allegiance .
<start> Tamen Senones , quae est civitas in primis firma et magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis , Cavarinum , quem Caesar apud eos regem constituerat , cuius frater Moritasgus adventu in Galliam Caesaris cuiusque maiores regnum obtinuerant , interficere publico consilio conati , cum ille praesensisset ac profugisset , usque ad fines insecuti regno domoque expulerunt et , missis ad Caesarem satisfaciendi causa legatis , cum is omnem ad se senatum venire iussisset , dicto audientes non fuerunt . <end>$$The Senones , however , which is a state eminently powerful and one of great influence among the Gauls , attempting by general design to slay Cavarinus , whom Caesar had created king among them , when he discovered their plot and fled , pursued him even to the frontiers , and drove him from his kingdom and his home ; and , after having sent embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of concluding a peace , when he ordered all their senate to come to him , did not obey that command .
<start> Tantum apud homines barbaros valuit esse aliquos repertos principes inferendi belli tantamque omnibus voluntatum commutationem attulit , ut praeter Aeduos et Remos , quos praecipuo semper honore Caesar habuit , alteros pro vetere ac perpetua erga populum Romanum fide , alteros pro recentibus Gallici belli officiis , nulla fere civitas fuerit non suspecta nobis . <end>$$So far did it operate among those barbarian people , that there were found some to be the first to wage war ; and so great a change of inclinations did it produce in all , that , except the Aedui and the Remi , whom Caesar had always held in especial honor , the one people for their long standing and uniform fidelity toward the Roman people , the other for their late service in the Gallic war , there was scarcely a state which was not suspected by us .
<start> Idque adeo haud scio mirandumne sit , cum compluribus aliis de causis , tum maxime quod ei , qui virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur , tantum se eius opinionis deperdidisse ut a populo Romano imperia perferrent gravissime dolebant . <end>$$And I do not know whether that ought much to be wondered at , as well for several other reasons , as particularly because they who ranked above all nations for prowess in war , most keenly regretted that they had lost so much of that reputation as to submit to commands from the Roman people .
<start> Treveri vero atque Indutiomarus totius hiemis nullum tempus intermiserunt , quin trans Rhenum legatos mitterent , civitates sollicitarent , pecunias pollicerentur , magna parte exercitus nostri interfecta multo minorem superesse dicerent partem . <end>$$But the Triviri and Indutiomarus let no part of the entire winter pass without sending embassadors across the Rhine , importuning the states , promising money , and asserting that , as a large portion of our army had been cut off , a much smaller portion remained .
<start> Neque tamen ulli civitati Germanorum persuaderi potuit , ut Rhenum transiret , cum se bis expertos dicerent , Ariovisti bello et Tencterorum transitu : non esse amplius fortunam temptaturos . <end>$$However , none of the German States could be induced to cross the Rhine , since they had twice essayed it , they said , in the war with Ariovistus and in the passage of the Tenchtheri there ; that fortune was not to be tempted any more .
<start> Hac spe lapsus Indutiomarus nihilo minus copias cogere , exercere , a finitimis equos parare , exules damnatosque tota Gallia magnis praemiis ad se allicere coepit . <end>$$Indutiomarus disappointed in this expectation , nevertheless began to raise troops , and discipline them , and procure horses from the neighboring people , and allure to him by great rewards the outlaws and convicts throughout Gaul .
<start> Ac tantam sibi iam his rebus in Gallia auctoritatem comparaverat ut undique ad eum legationes concurrerent , gratiam atque amicitiam publice privatimque peterent . <end>$$And such great influence had he already acquired for himself in Gaul by these means , that embassies were flocking to him in all directions , and seeking , publicly and privately , his favor and friendship .
<start> Vbi intellexit ultro ad se veniri , altera ex parte Senones Carnutesque conscientia facinoris instigari , altera Nervios Aduatucosque bellum Romanis parare , neque sibi voluntariorum copias defore , si ex finibus suis progredi coepisset , armatum concilium indicit Hoc more Gallorum est initium belli , quo lege communi omnes puberes armati convenire consuerunt ; qui ex eis novissimus convenit , in conspectu multitudinis omnibus cruciatibus affectus necatur . <end>$$When he perceived that they were coming to him voluntarily ; that on the one side the Senones and the Carnutes were stimulated by their consciousness of guilt , on the other side the Nervii and the Aduatuci were preparing war against the Romans , and that forces of volunteers would not be wanting to him if he began to advance from his own territories , he proclaims an armed council at which , by a common law , all the youth were wont to assemble in arms , whoever of them comes last is killed in the sight of the whole assembly after being racked with every torture .
<start> His rebus confectis , in concilio pronuntiat arcessitum se a Senonibus et Carnutibus aliisque compluribus Galliae civitatibus ; huc iturum per fines Remorum eorumque agros popula turum ac , priusquam id faciat , castra Labieni oppugnaturum . <end>$$In that council he declares Cingetorix , the leader of the other faction , his own son-in-law an enemy and confiscates his property .
<start> Labienus , cum et loci natura et manu munitissumis castris sese teneret , de suo ac legionis periculo nihil timebat ; ne quam occasionem rei bene gerendae dimitteret , cogitabat . <end>$$Labienus , since he was confining himself within a camp strongly fortified by the nature of the ground and by art , had no apprehensions as to his own and the legion's danger , but was devising that he might throw away no opportunity of conducting the war successfully .
<start> Itaque a Cingetorige atque eius propinquis oratione Indutiomari cognita , quam in concilio habuerat , nuntios mittit ad finitimas civitates equitesque undique evocat : his certum diem conveniendi dicit . <end>$$Accordingly , the speech of Indutiomarus , which he had delivered in the council , having been made known by Cingetorix and his allies , he sends messengers to the neighboring states and summons horse from all quarters : he appoints to them a fixed day for assembling .
<start> Interim prope cotidie cum omni equitatu Indutiomarus sub castris eius vagabatur , alias ut situm castrorum cognosceret , alias colloquendi aut territandi causa : equites plerumque omnes tela intra vallum coniciebant . <end>$$In the mean time , Indutiomarus , with all his cavalry , nearly every day used to parade close to his camp ; at one time , that he might inform himself of the situation of the camp ; at another time , for the purpose of conferring with or of intimidating him .
<start> Labienus suos intra munitionem continebat timorisque opinionem , quibuscumque poterat rebus , augebat . <end>$$Labienus confined his men within the fortifications , and promoted the enemy's belief of his fear by whatever methods he could .
<start> Cum maiore in dies contemptione Indutiomarus ad castra accederet , nocte una intromissis equitibus omnium finitimarum civitatum quos arcessendos curaverat , tanta diligentia omnes suos custodiis intra castra continuit , ut nulla ratione ea res enuntiari aut ad Treveros perferri posset . <end>$$Since Indutiomarus was daily advancing up to the camp with greater defiance , all the cavalry of the neighboring states which he had taken care to have sent for , having been admitted in one night , he confined all his men within the camp by guards with such great strictness , that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to the Treviri .
<start> Interim ex consuetudine cotidiana Indutiomarus ad castra accedit atque ibi magnam partem diei consumit ; equites tela coniciunt et magna cum contumelia verborum nostros ad pugnam evocant . <end>$$In the mean while , Indutiomarus , according to his daily practice , advances up to the camp and spends a great part of the day there : his horse cast their weapons , and with very insulting language call out our men to battle .
<start> Comprobat hominis consilium fortuna , et cum unum omnes peterent , in ipso fluminis vado deprehensus Indutiomarus interficitur , caputque eius refertur in castra : redeuntes equites quos possunt consectantur atque occidunt . <end>$$The issue justifies the policy of the man , and since all aimed at one , Indutiomarus is slain , having been overtaken at the shawn ford of the river , and his head is carried to the camp , the horse , when returning , pursue and slay all whom they can .
<start> Hac re cognita omnes Eburonum et Nerviorum quae convenerant copiae discedunt , pauloque habuit post id factum Caesar quietiorem Galliam . <end>$$This affair having been known , all the forces of the Eburones and the Nervii which had assembled , depart ; and for a short time after this action , Caesar was less harassed in the government of Gaul .
<start> Multis de causis Caesar maiorem Galliae motum exspectans per Marcum Silanum , Gaium Antistium Reginum , Titum Sextium legatos delectum habere instituit ; simul ab Gnaeo Pompeio proconsule petit , quoniam ipse ad urbem cum imperio rei publicae causa remaneret , quos ex Cisalpina Gallia consulis sacramento rogavisset , ad signa convenire et ad se proficisci iuberet , magni interesse etiam in reliquum tempus ad opinionem Galliae existimans tantas videri Italiae facultates ut , si quid esset in bello detrimenti acceptum , non modo id brevi tempore sarciri , sed etiam maioribus augeri copiis posset . <end>$$Caesar , expecting for many reasons a greater commotion in Gaul , resolves to hold a levy by the means of M Silanus C Antistius Reginus , and T Sextius , his lieutenants : at the same time he requested Cn Pompey , the proconsul , that since he was remaining near the city invested with military command for the interests of the commonwealth , he would command those men whom when consul he had levied by the military oath in Cisalpine Gaul , to join their respective corps , and to proceed to him ; thinking it of great importance , as far as regarded the opinion which the Gauls would entertain for the future , that that the resources of Italy should appear so great that if any loss should be sustained in war , not only could it be repaired in a short time , but likewise be further supplied by still larger forces .
<start> Interfecto Indutiomaro , ut docuimus , ad eius propinquos a Treveris imperium defertur . <end>$$Indutiomarus having been slain , as we have stated , the government was conferred upon his relatives by the Treviri .
<start> Illi finitimos Germanos sollicitare et pecuniam polliceri non desistunt Cum ab proximis impetrare non possent , ulteriores temptant . <end>$$They cease not to importune the neighboring Germans and to promise them money : when they could not obtain from those nearest them , they try those more remote .
<start> Inventis nonnullis civitatibus iureiurando inter se confirmant obsidibusque de pecunia cavent : Ambiorigem sibi societate et foedere adiungunt . <end>$$Having found some states willing to accede to their wishes , they enter into a compact with them by a mutual oath , and give hostages as a security for the money : they attach Ambiorix to them by an alliance and confederacy .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar , cum undique bellum parari videret , Nervios , Aduatucos ac Menapios adiunctis Cisrhenanis omnibus Germanis esse in armis , Senones ad imperatum non venire et cum Carnutibus finitimisque civitatibus consilia communicare , a Treveris Germanos crebris legationibus sollicitari , maturius sibi de bello cogitandum putavit . <end>$$Caesar , on being informed of their acts , since he saw that war was being prepared on all sides , that the Nervii , Aduatuci , and Menapii , with the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine were under arms , that the Senones did not assemble according to his command , and were concerting measures with the Carnutes and the neighboring states , that the Germans were importuned by the Treviri in frequent embassies , thought that he ought to take measures for the war earlier  .
<start> Itaque nondum hieme confecta proximis quattuor coactis legionibus de improviso in fines Nerviorum contendit et , priusquam illi aut convenire aut profugere possent , magno pecoris atque hominum numero capto atque ea praeda militibus concessa vastatisque agris in deditionem venire atque obsides sibi dare coegit . <end>$$Accordingly , while the winter was not yet ended , having concentrated the four nearest legions , he marched unexpectedly into the territories of the Nervii , and before they could either assemble or retreat , after capturing a large number of cattle and of men , and wasting their lands and giving up that booty to the soldiers , compelled them to enter into a surrender and give him hostages .
<start> Eo celeriter confecto negotio rursus in hiberna legiones reduxit . <end>$$That business having been speedily executed , he again led his legions back into winter-quarters .
<start> Concilio Galliae primo vere , ut instituerat , indicto , cum reliqui praeter Senones , Carnutes Treverosque venissent , initium belli ac defectionis hoc esse arbitratus , ut omnia postponere videretur , concilium Lutetiam Parisiorum transfert . <end>$$Having proclaimed a council of Gaul in the beginning of the spring , as he had been accustomed , when the deputies from the rest , except the Senones , the Carnutes , and the Treviri , had come , judging this to be the commencement of war and revolt , that he might appear to consider all things of less consequence , he transfers the council to Lutetia of the Parisii .
<start> Confines erant hi Senonibus civitatemque patrum memoria coniunxerant , sed ab hoc consilio afuisse esistimabantur . <end>$$These were adjacent to the Senones , and had united their state to them during the memory of their fathers , but were thought to have no part in the present plot .
<start> Hac re pro suggestu pronuntiata eodem die cum legionibus in Senones proficiscitur magnisque itineribus eo pervenit . <end>$$Having proclaimed this from the tribunal , he advances the same day toward the Senones with his legions , and arrives among them by long marches .
<start> Cognito eius adventu Acco , qui princeps eius consili fuerat , iubet in oppida multitudinem convenire Conantibus , priusquam id effici posset , adesse Romanos nuntiatur Necessario sententia desistunt legatosque deprecandi causa ad Caesarem mittunt : adeunt per Aeduos , quorum antiquitus erat in fide civitas . <end>$$Acco , who had been the author of that enterprise , on being informed of his arrival , orders the people to assemble in the towns ; to them , while attempting this , and before it could be accomplished , news is brought that the Romans are close at hand : through necessity they give over their design and send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of imploring pardon ; they make advances to him through the Aedui , whose state was from ancient times under the protection of Rome .
<start> Libenter Caesar petentibus Aeduis dat veniam excusationemque accipit , quod aestivum tempus instantis belli , non quaestionis esse arbitrabatur . <end>$$Caesar readily grants them pardon , and receives their excuse , at the request of the Aedui , because he thought that the summer season was one for an impending war , not for an investigation .
<start> Obsidibus imperatis centum hos Aeduis custodiendos tradit . <end>$$Having imposed one hundred hostages , he delivers these to the Aedui to be held in charge by them .
<start> Eodem Carnutes legatos obsidesque mittunt usi deprecatoribus Renis , quorum erant in clientela : eadem ferunt responsa . <end>$$To the same place the Carnutes send embassadors and hostages , employing as their mediators the Remi , under whose protection they were : they receive the same answers .
<start> Peragit concilium Caesar equitesque imperat civitatibus . <end>$$Caesar concludes the council and imposes a levy of cavalry on the states .
<start> Hac parte Galliae pacata totus et mente et animo in bellum Treverorum et Ambiorigis insistit . <end>$$This part of Gaul having been tranquilized , he applies himself entirely both in mind and soul to the war with the Treviri and Ambiorix .
<start> Cavarinum cum equitatu Senonum secum proficisci iubet , ne quis aut ex huius iracundia aut ex eo , quod meruerat , odio civitatis motus exsistat . <end>$$He orders Cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of the Senones , lest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper , or out of the hatred of the state which he had incurred .
<start> His rebus constitutis , quod pro explorato habebat Ambiorigem proelio non esse concertaturum , reliqua eius consilia animo circumspiciebat . <end>$$After arranging these things , as he considered it certain that Ambiorix would not contend in battle , he watched his other plans attentively .
<start> Erant Menapii propinqui Eburonum finibus , perpetuis paludibus silvisque muniti , qui uni ex Gallia de pace ad Caesarem legatos numquam miserant . <end>$$The Menapii bordered on the territories of the Eburones , and were protected by one continued extent of morasses and woods ; and they alone out of Gaul had never sent embassadors to Caesar on the subject of peace .
<start> Cum his esse hospitium Ambiorigi sciebat ; item per Treveros venisse Germanis in amicitiam cognoverat . <end>$$Caesar knew that a tie of hospitality subsisted between them and Ambiorix : he also discovered that the latter had entered into an alliance with the Germans by means of the Treviri .
<start> Haec prius illi detrahenda auxilia existimabat quam ipsum bello lacesseret , ne desperata salute aut se in Menapios abderet aut cum Transrhenanis congredi cogeretur . <end>$$Ho thought that these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him before he provoked him to war ; lest he , despairing of safety , should either proceed to conceal himself in the territories of the Menapii , or should be driven to coalesce with the Germans beyond the Rhine .
<start> Hoc inito consilio totius exercitus impedimenta ad Labienum in Treveros mittit duasque legiones ad eum proficisci iubet ; ipse cum legionibus expeditis quinque in Menapios proficiscitur . <end>$$Having entered upon this resolution , he sends the baggage of the whole army to Labienus , in the territories of the Treviri and orders two legions to proceed to him : he himself proceeds against the Menapii with five lightly-equipped legions .
<start> Illi nulla coacta manu loci praesidio freti in silvas paludesque confugiunt suaque eodem conferunt . <end>$$They , having assembled no troops , as they relied on the defense of their position , retreat into the woods and morasses , and convey thither all their property .
<start> Caesar partitis copiis cum Gaio Fabio legato et Marco Crasso quaestore celeriterque effectis pontibus adit tripertito , aedificia vicosque incendit , magno pecoris atque hominum numero potitur . <end>$$Caesar , having divided his forces with C Fabius , his lieutenant , and M Crassus his questor , and having hastily constructed some bridges , enters their country in three divisions , burns their houses and villages , and gets possession of a large number of cattle and men .
<start> Quibus rebus coacti Menapii legatos ad eum pacis petendae causa mittunt . <end>$$Constrained by these circumstances the Menapii send embassadors to him for the purpose of suing for peace .
<start> Ille obsidibus acceptis hostium se habiturum numero confirmat , si aut Ambiorigem aut eius legatos finibus suis recepissent . <end>$$He , after receiving hostages , assures them that he will consider them in the number of his enemies if they shall receive within their territories either Ambiorix or his embassadors .
<start> His confirmatis rebus Commium Atrebatem cum equitatu custodis loco in Menapiis relinquit ; ipse in Treveros proficiscitur . <end>$$Having determinately settled these things , he left among the Menapii , Commius the Atrebatian , with some cavalry as a guard ; he himself proceeds toward the Treviri .
<start> Dum haec a Caesare geruntur , Treveri magnis coactis peditatus equitatusque copiis Labienum cum una legione , quae in eorum finibus hiemaverat , adoriri parabant , iamque ab eo non longius bidui via aberant , cum duas venisse legiones missu Caesaris cognoscunt . <end>$$While these things are being performed by Caesar , the Treviri , having drawn together large forces of infantry and cavalry , were preparing to attack Labienus and the legion which was wintering in their territories , and were already not further distant from him than a journey of two days , when they learn that two legions had arrived by the order of Caesar .
<start> Positis castris a milibus passuum XV auxilia Germanorum esspectare constituunt . <end>$$Having pitched their camp fifteen miles off , they resolve to await the support of the Germans .
<start> Labienus hostium cognito consilio sperans temeritate eorum fore aliquam dimicandi facultatem praesidio quinque cohortium impedimentis relicto cum viginti quinque cohortibus magnoque equitatu contra hostem proficiscitur et mille passuum intermisso spatio castra communit . <end>$$Labienus , having learned the design of the enemy , hoping that through their rashness there would be some opportunity of engaging , after leaving a guard of five cohorts for the baggage , advances against the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large body of cavalry , and , leaving the space of a mile between them , fortifies his camp .
<start> Erat inter Labienum atque hostem difficili transitu flumen ripisque praeruptis Hoc neque ipse transire habebat in animo neque hostes transituros existimabat . <end>$$There was between Labienus and the enemy a river difficult to cross , and with steep banks : this neither did he himself design to cross , nor did he suppose the enemy would cross it .
<start> Augebatur auxiliorum cotidie spes . <end>$$Their hope of auxiliaries was daily increasing .
<start> Loquitur in concilio palam , quoniam Germani appropinquare dicantur , sese suas exercitusque fortunas in dubium non devocaturum et postero die prima luce castra moturum . <end>$$He openly says in a council that since the Germans are said to be approaching , he would not bring into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes , and the next day would move his camp at early dawn .
<start> Celeriter haec ad hostes deferuntur , ut ex magno Gallorum equitum numero nonnullos Gallicis rebus favere natura cogebat . <end>$$These words are quickly carried to the enemy , since out of so large a number of cavalry composed of Gauls , nature compelled some to favor the Gallic interests .
<start> Labienus noctu tribunis militum primisque ordinibus convocatis , quid sui sit consili proponit et , quo facilius hostibus timoris det suspicionem , maiore strepitu et tumultu , quam populi Romani fert consuetudo castra moveri iubet . <end>$$Labienus , having assembled the tribunes of the soldiers and principal centurions by night , states what his design is , and , that he may the more easily give the enemy a belief of his fears , he orders the camp to be moved with greater noise and confusion than was usual with the Roman people .
<start> His rebus fugae similem profectionem effecit . <end>$$By these means he makes his departure like a retreat .
<start> Haec quoque per exploratores ante lucem in tanta propinquitate castrorum ad hostes deferuntur . <end>$$These things , also , since the camps were so near , are reported to the enemy by scouts before daylight .
<start> Vix agmen novissimum extra munitiones processerat , cum Galli cohortati inter se , ne speratam praedam ex manibus dimitterent--longum esse perterritis Romanis Germanorum auxilium exspectare , neque suam pati dignitatem ut tantis copiis tam exiguam manum praesertim fugientem atque impeditam adoriri non audeant--flumen transire et iniquo loco committere proelium non dubitant . <end>$$Scarcely had the rear advanced beyond the fortifications when the Gauls , encouraging one another not to cast from their hands the anticipated booty , that it was a tedious thing , while the Romans were panic-stricken , to be waiting for the aid of the Germans , and that their dignity did not suffer them to fear to attack with such great forces so small a band , particularly when retreating and encumbered , do not hesitate to cross the river and give battle in a disadvantageous position .
<start> Tum praemissis paulum impedimentis atque in tumulo quodam collocatis Habetis , inquit , milites , quam petistis facultatem : hostem impedito atque iniquo loco tenetis : praestate eandem nobis ducibus virtutem , quam saepe numero imperatori praestitistis , atque illum adesse et haec coram cernere existimate . <end>$$Labienus suspecting that these things would happen , was proceeding quietly , and using the same pretense of a march , in order that he might entice them across the river .
<start> Cum his propinqui Indutiomari , qui defectionis auctores fuerant , comitati eos ex civitate excesserunt . <end>$$The relations of Indutiomarus , who had been the promoters of the revolt , accompanying them , quitted their own state with them .
<start> Caesar , postquam ex Menapiis in Treveros venit , duabus de causis Rhenum transire constituit ; quarum una erat , quod auxilia contra se Treveris miserant , altera , ne ad eos Ambiorix receptum haberet . <end>$$Caesar , after he came from the territories of the Menapii into those of the Treviri , resolved for two reasons to cross the Rhine ; one of which was , because they had sent assistance to the Treviri against him ; the other , that Ambiorix might not have a retreat among them .
<start> His constitutis rebus paulum supra eum locum quo ante exercitum traduxerat facere pontem instituit . <end>$$Having determined on these matters , he began to build a bridge a little above that place where he had before conveyed over his army .
<start> Nota atque instituta ratione magno militum studio paucis diebus opus efficitur . <end>$$The plan having been known and laid down , the work is accomplished in a few days by the great exertion of the soldiers .
<start> Firmo in Treveris ad pontem praesidio relicto , ne quis ab his subito motus oreretur , reliquas copias equitatumque traducit . <end>$$Having left a strong guard at the bridge on the side of the Treviri , lest any commotion should suddenly arise among them , he leads over the rest of the forces and the cavalry .
<start> Vbii , qui ante obsides dederant atque in deditionem venerant , purgandi sui causa ad eum legatos mittunt , qui doceant neque auxilia ex sua civitate in Treveros missa neque ab se fidem laesam : petunt atque orant ut sibi parcat , ne communi odio Germanorum innocentes pro nocentibus poenas pendant ; si amplius obsidum vellet , dare pollicentur . <end>$$The Ubii , who before had sent hostages and come to a capitulation , send embassadors to him , for the purpose of vindicating themselves , to assure him that neither had auxiliaries been sent to the Treviri from their state , nor had they violated their allegiance ; they entreat and beseech him to spare them , lest , in his common hatred of the Germans , the innocent should suffer the penalty of the guilty : they promise to give more hostages , if he desire them .
<start> Cognita Caesar causa reperit ab Suebis auxilia missa esse ; Vbiorum satisfactionem accipit , aditus viasque in Suebos perquirit . <end>$$Having investigated the case , Caesar finds that the auxiliaries had been sent by the Suevi ; he accepts the apology of the Ubii , and makes the minute inquiries concerning the approaches and the routes to the territories of the Suevi .
<start> Interim paucis post diebus fit ab Vbiis certior Suebos omnes in unum locum copias cogere atque eis nationibus quae sub eorum sint imperio denuntiare , ut auxilia peditatus equitatusque mittant . <end>$$In the mean time he is informed by the Ubii , a few days after , that the Suevi are drawing all their forces into one place , and are giving orders to those nations which are under their government to send auxiliaries of infantry and of cavalry .
<start> His cognitis rebus rem frumentariam providet , castris idoneum locum deligit ; Vbiis imperat ut pecora deducant suaque omnia ex agris in oppida conferant , sperans barbaros atque imperitos homines inopia cibariorum adductos ad iniquam pugnandi condicionem posse deduci ; mandat , ut crebros exploratores in Suebos mittant quaeque apud eos gerantur cognoscant . <end>$$Having learned these things , he provides a supply of corn , selects a proper place for his camp , and commands the Ubii to drive off their cattle and carry away all their possessions from the country parts into the towns , hoping that they , being a barbarous and ignorant people , when harassed by the want of provisions , might be brought to an engagement on disadvantageous terms : he orders them to send numerous scouts among the Suevi , and learn what things are going on among them .
<start> Illi imperata faciunt et paucis diebus intermissis referunt : Suebos omnes , posteaquam certiores nuntii de exercitu Romanorum venerint , cum omnibus suis sociorumque copiis , quas coegissent , penitus ad extremos fines se recepisse : silvam esse ibi infinita magnitudine , quae appellatur Bacenis ; hanc longe introrsus pertinere et pro nativo muro obiectam Cheruscos ab Suebis Suebosque ab Cheruscis iniuriis incursionibusque prohibere : ad eius initium silvae Suebos adventum Romanorum exspectare constituisse . <end>$$They execute the orders , and , a few days having intervened , report that all the Suevi , after certain intelligence concerning the army of the Romans had come , retreated with all their own forces and those of their allies , which they had assembled , to the utmost extremities of their territories : that there is a wood there of very great extent , which is called Bacenis ; that this stretches a great way into the interior , and , being opposed as a natural barrier , defends from injuries and incursions the Cherusci against the Suevi , and the Suevi against the Cherusci : that at the entrance of that forest the Suevi had determined to await the coming up of the Romans .
<start> Quoniam ad hunc locum perventum est , non alienum esse videtur de Galliae Germaniaeque moribus et quo differant hae nationes inter sese proponere . <end>$$Since we have come to the place , it does not appear to be foreign to our subject to lay before the reader an account of the manners of Gaul and Germany , and wherein these nations differ from each other .
<start> In Gallia non solum in omnibus civitatibus atque in omnibus pagis partibusque , sed paene etiam in singulis domibus factiones sunt , earumque factionum principes sunt qui summam auctoritatem eorum iudicio habere existimantur , quorum ad arbitrium iudiciumque summa omnium rerum consiliorumque redeat . <end>$$In Gaul there are factions not only in all the states , and in all the cantons and their divisions , but almost in each family , and of these factions those are the leaders who are considered according to their judgment to possess the greatest influence , upon whose will and determination the management of all affairs and measures depends .
<start> Idque eius rei causa antiquitus institutum videtur , ne quis ex plebe contra potentiorem auxili egeret : suos enim quisque opprimi et circumveniri non patitur , neque , aliter si faciat , ullam inter suos habet auctoritatem . <end>$$And that seems to have been instituted in ancient times with this view , that no one of the common people should be in want of support against one more powerful ; for , none suffers his party to be oppressed and defrauded , and if he do otherwise , he has no influence among his party .
<start> Haec eadem ratio est in summa totius Galliae : namque omnes civitates in partes divisae sunt duas . <end>$$This same policy exists throughout the whole of Gaul ; for all the states are divided into two factions .
<start> Cum Caesar in Galliam venit , alterius factionis principes erant Aedui , alterius Sequani . <end>$$When Caesar arrived in Gaul , the Aedui were the leaders of one faction , the Sequani of the other .
<start> Hi cum per se minus valerent , quod summa auctoritas antiquitus erat in Aeduis magnaeque eorum erant clientelae , Germanos atque Ariovistum sibi adiunxerant eosque ad se magnis iacturis pollicitationibusque perduxerant . <end>$$Since the latter were less powerful by themselves , inasmuch as the chief influence was from of old among the Aedui , and their dependencies were great , they had united to themselves the Germans and Ariovistus , and had brought them over to their party by great sacrifices and promises .
<start> Proeliis vero compluribus factis secundis atque omni nobilitate Aeduorum interfecta tantum potentia antecesserant , ut magnam partem clientium ab Aeduis ad se traducerent obsidesque ab eis principum filios acciperent et publice iurare cogerent nihil se contra Sequanos consili inituros et partem finitimi agri per vim occupatam possiderent Galliaeque totius principatum obtinerent . <end>$$And having fought several successful battles and slain all the nobility of the Aedui , they had so far surpassed them in power , that they brought over , from the Aedui to themselves , a large portion of their dependents and received from them the sons of their leading men as hostages , and compelled them to swear in their public character that they would enter into no design against them ; and held a portion of the neighboring land , seized on by force , and possessed the sovereignty of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Qua necessitate adductus Diviciacus auxili petendi causa Romam ad senatum profectus infecta re redierat . <end>$$Divitiacus urged by this necessity , had proceeded to Rome to the senate , for the purpose of entreating assistance , and had returned without accomplishing his object .
<start> Adventu Caesaris facta commutatione rerum , obsidibus Aeduis redditis , veteribus clientelis restitutis , novis per Caesarem comparatis , quod hi , qui se ad eorum amicitiam adgregaverant , meliore condicione atque aequiore imperio se uti videbant , reliquis rebus eorum gratia dignitateque amplificata Sequani principatum dimiserant . <end>$$A change of affairs ensued on the arrival of Caesar , the hostages were returned to the Aedui , their old dependencies restored , and new acquired through Caesar , their other interests , their influence , their reputation were likewise increased , and in consequence , the Sequani lost the sovereignty .
<start> In eorum locum Remi successerant : quos quod adaequare apud Caesarem gratia intellegebatur , ei , qui propter veteres inimicitias nullo modo cum Aeduis coniungi poterant , se Remis in clientelam dicabant . <end>$$The Remi succeeded to their place , and , as it was perceived that they equaled the Aedui in favor with Caesar , those , who on account of their old animosities could by no means coalesce with the Aedui , consigned themselves in clientship to the Remi .
<start> Hos illi diligenter tuebantur : ita et novam et repente collectam auctoritatem tenebant . <end>$$The latter carefully protected them Thus they possessed both a new and suddenly acquired influence .
<start> Eo tum statu res erat , ut longe principes haberentur Aedui , secundum locum dignitatis Remi obtinerent . <end>$$Affairs were then in that position that the Aedui were considered by far the leading people , and the Remi held the second post of honor .
<start> In omni Gallia eorum hominum , qui aliquo sunt numero atque honore , genera sunt duo Nam plebes paene servorum habetur loco , quae nihil audet per se , nullo adhibetur consilio . <end>$$Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who are of any rank and dignity : for the commonality is held almost in the condition of slaves , and dares to undertake nothing of itself , and is admitted to no deliberation .
<start> Nobilibus in hos eadem omnia sunt iura , quae dominis in servos . <end>$$But of these two orders , one is that of the Druids , the other that of the knights .
<start> Sed de his duobus generibus alterum est druidum , alterum equitum . <end>$$The former are engaged in things sacred , conduct the public and the private sacrifices , and interpret all matters of religion .
<start> Illi rebus divinis intersunt , sacrificia publica ac privata procurant , religiones interpretantur : ad hos magnus adulescentium numerus disciplinae causa concurrit , magnoque hi sunt apud eos honore . <end>$$To these a large number of the young men resort for the purpose of instruction , and they are in great honor among them .
<start> Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt , et , si quod est admissum facinus , si caedes facta , si de hereditate , de finibus controversia est , idem decernunt , praemia poenasque constituunt ; si qui aut privatus aut populus eorum decreto non stetit , sacrificiis interdicunt . <end>$$For they determine respecting almost all controversies , public and private ; and if any crime has been perpetrated , if murder has been committed , if there be any dispute about an inheritance , if any about boundaries , these same persons decide it ; they decree rewards and punishments ; if any one , either in a private or public capacity , has not submitted to their decision , they interdict him from the sacrifices .
<start> Haec poena apud eos est gravissima . <end>$$This among them is the most heavy punishment .
<start> Quibus ita est interdictum , hi numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habentur , his omnes decedunt , aditum sermonemque defugiunt , ne quid ex contagione incommodi accipiant , neque his petentibus ius redditur neque honos ullus communicatur . <end>$$Those who have been thus interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the criminal : all shun them , and avoid their society and conversation , lest they receive some evil from their contact ; nor is justice administered to them when seeking it , nor is any dignity bestowed on them .
<start> His autem omnibus druidibus praeest unus , qui summam inter eos habet auctoritatem . <end>$$Over all these Druids one presides , who possesses supreme authority among them .
<start> Hoc mortuo aut si qui ex reliquis excellit dignitate succedit , aut , si sunt plures pares , suffragio druidum , nonnumquam etiam armis de principatu contendunt . <end>$$Upon his death , if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent in dignity , he succeeds ; but , if there are many equal , the election is made by the suffrages of the Druids ; sometimes they even contend for the presidency with arms .
<start> Hi certo anni tempore in finibus Carnutum , quae regio totius Galliae media habetur , considunt in loco consecrato . <end>$$These assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated place in the territories of the Carnutes , which is reckoned the central region of the whole of Gaul .
<start> Huc omnes undique , qui controversias habent , conveniunt eorumque decretis iudiciisque parent . <end>$$Hither all , who have disputes , assemble from every part , and submit to their decrees and determinations .
<start> Disciplina in Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur , et nunc , qui diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt , plerumque illo discendi causa proficiscuntur . <end>$$This institution is supposed to have been devised in Britain , and to have been brought over from it into Gaul ; and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying it .
<start> Druides a bello abesse consuerunt neque tributa una cum reliquis pendunt ; militiae vacationem omniumque rerum habent immunitatem . <end>$$The Druids do not go to war , nor pay tribute together with the rest ; they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in all matters .
<start> Tantis excitati praemiis et sua sponte multi in disciplinam conveniunt et a parentibus propinquisque mittuntur . <end>$$Induced by such great advantages , many embrace this profession of their own accord , and are sent to it by their parents and relations .
<start> Magnum ibi numerum versuum ediscere dicuntur Itaque annos nonnulli vicenos in disciplina permanent . <end>$$They are said there to learn by heart a great number of verses ; accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty years .
<start> Neque fas esse existimant ea litteris mandare , cum in reliquis fere rebus , publicis privatisque rationibus Graecis litteris utantur . <end>$$Nor do they regard it lawful to commit these to writing , though in almost all other matters , in their public and private transactions , they use Greek characters .
<start> Id mihi duabus de causis instituisse videntur , quod neque in vulgum disciplinam efferri velint neque eos , qui discunt , litteris confisos minus memoriae studere : quod fere plerisque accidit , ut praesidio litterarum diligentiam in perdiscendo ac memoriam remittant . <end>$$That practice they seem to me to have adopted for two reasons ; because they neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people , nor those who learn , to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory , relying on writing ; since it generally occurs to most men , that , in their dependence on writing , they relax their diligence in learning thoroughly , and their employment of the memory .
<start> In primis hoc volunt persuadere , non interire animas , sed ab aliis post mortem transire ad alios , atque hoc maxime ad virtutem excitari putant metu mortis neglecto . <end>$$They wish to inculcate this as one of their leading tenets , that souls do not become extinct , but pass after death from one body to another , and they think that men by this tenet are in a great degree excited to valor , the fear of death being disregarded .
<start> Multa praeterea de sideribus atque eorum motu , de mundi ac terrarum magnitudine , de rerum natura , de deorum immortalium vi ac potestate disputant et iuventuti tradunt . <end>$$They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many things respecting the stars and their motion , respecting the extent of the world and of our earth , respecting the nature of things , respecting the power and the majesty of the immortal gods .
<start> Alterum genus est equitum . <end>$$The other order is that of the knights .
<start> Hi , cum est usus atque aliquod bellum incidit (quod fere ante Caesaris adventum quotannis accidere solebat , uti aut ipsi iniurias inferrent aut illatas propulsarent) , omnes in bello versantur , atque eorum ut quisque est genere copiisque amplissimus , ita plurimos circum se ambactos clientesque habet . <end>$$These , when there is occasion and any war occurs , are all engaged in war And those of them most distinguished by birth and resources , have the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them .
<start> Hanc unam gratiam potentiamque noverunt . <end>$$They acknowledge this sort of influence and power only .
<start> Natio est omnis Gallorum admodum dedita religionibus , atque ob eam causam , qui sunt adfecti gravioribus morbis quique in proeliis periculisque versantur , aut pro victimis homines immolant aut se immolaturos vovent administrisque ad ea sacrificia druidibus utuntur , quod , pro vita hominis nisi hominis vita reddatur , non posse deorum immortalium numen placari arbitrantur , publiceque eiusdem generis habent instituta sacrificia . <end>$$The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious rites ; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe diseases , and they who are engaged in battles and dangers , either sacrifice men as victims , or vow that they will sacrifice them , and employ the Druids as the performers of those sacrifices ; because they think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man , the mind of the immortal gods can not be rendered propitious , and they have sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes .
<start> Alii immani magnitudine simulacra habent , quorum contexta viminibus membra vivis hominibus complent ; quibus succensis circumventi flamma exanimantur homines . <end>$$Others have figures of vast size , the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men , which being set on fire , the men perish enveloped in the flames .
<start> Supplicia eorum qui in furto aut in latrocinio aut aliqua noxia sint comprehensi gratiora dis immortalibus esse arbitrantur ; sed , cum eius generis copia defecit , etiam ad innocentium supplicia descendunt . <end>$$They consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft , or in robbery , or any other offense , is more acceptable to the immortal gods ; but when a supply of that class is wanting , they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent .
<start> Deum maxime Mercurium colunt Huius sunt plurima simulacra : hunc omnium inventorem artium ferunt , hunc viarum atque itinerum ducem , hunc ad quaestus pecuniae mercaturasque habere vim maximam arbitrantur . <end>$$They worship as their divinity , Mercury in particular , and have many images of him , and regard him as the inventor of all arts , they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches , and believe him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions .
<start> De his eandem fere , quam reliquae gentes , habent opinionem : Apollinem morbos depellere , Minervam operum atque artificiorum initia tradere , Iovem imperium caelestium tenere , Martem bella regere . <end>$$To him , when they have determined to engage in battle , they commonly vow those things which they shall take in war .
<start> Huic , cum proelio dimicare constituerunt , ea quae bello ceperint plerumque devovent : cum superaverunt , animalia capta immolant reliquasque res in unum locum conferunt . <end>$$When they have conquered , they sacrifice whatever captured animals may have survived the conflict , and collect the other things into one place .
<start> Multis in civitatibus harum rerum exstructos tumulos locis consecratis conspicari licet ; neque saepe accidit , ut neglecta quispiam religione aut capta apud se occultare aut posita tollere auderet , gravissimumque ei rei supplicium cum cruciatu constitutum est . <end>$$In many states you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated spots ; nor does it often happen that any one , disregarding the sanctity of the case , dares either to secrete in his house things captured , or take away those deposited ; and the most severe punishment , with torture , has been established for such a deed .
<start> Galli se omnes ab Dite patre prognatos praedicant idque ab druidibus proditum dicunt . <end>$$All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis , and say that this tradition has been handed down by the Druids .
<start> Ob eam causam spatia omnis temporis non numero dierum sed noctium finiunt ; dies natales et mensum et annorum initia sic observant ut noctem dies subsequatur . <end>$$For that reason they compute the divisions of every season , not by the number of days , but of nights ; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night .
<start> In reliquis vitae institutis hoc fere ab reliquis differunt , quod suos liberos , nisi cum adoleverunt , ut munus militiae sustinere possint , palam ad se adire non patiuntur filiumque puerili aetate in publico in conspectu patris adsistere turpe ducunt . <end>$$Among the other usages of their life , they differ in this from almost all other nations , that they do not permit their children to approach them openly until they are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war ; and they regard it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence of his father .
<start> Viri , quantas pecunias ab uxoribus dotis nomine acceperunt , tantas ex suis bonis aestimatione facta cum dotibus communicant . <end>$$Whatever sums of money the husbands have received in the name of dowry from their wives , making an estimate of it , they add the same amount out of their own estates .
<start> Huius omnis pecuniae coniunctim ratio habetur fructusque servantur : uter eorum vita superarit , ad eum pars utriusque cum fructibus superiorum temporum pervenit . <end>$$An account is kept of all this money conjointly , and the profits are laid by : whichever of them shall have survived , to that one the portion of both reverts together with the profits of the previous time .
<start> Viri in uxores , sicuti in liberos , vitae necisque habent potestatem ; et cum paterfamiliae illustriore loco natus decessit , eius propinqui conveniunt et , de morte si res in suspicionem venit , de uxoribus in servilem modum quaestionem habent et , si compertum est , igni atque omnibus tormentis excruciatas interficiunt . <end>$$Husbands have power of life and death over their wives as well as over their children : and when the father of a family , born in a more than commonly distinguished rank , has died , his relations assemble , and , if the circumstances of his death are suspicious , hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves ; and , if proof be obtained , put them to severe torture , and kill them .
<start> Funera sunt pro cultu Gallorum magnifica et sumptuosa ; omniaque quae vivis cordi fuisse arbitrantur in ignem inferunt , etiam animalia , ac paulo supra hanc memoriam servi et clientes , quos ab eis dilectos esse constabat , iustis funeribus confectis una cremabantur . <end>$$Their funerals , considering the state of civilization among the Gauls , are magnificent and costly ; and they cast into the fire all things , including living creatures , which they suppose to have been dear to them when alive ; and , a little before this period , slaves and dependents , who were ascertained to have been beloved by them , were , after the regular funeral rites were completed , burnt together with them .
<start> Quae civitates commodius suam rem publicam administrare existimantur , habent legibus sanctum , si quis quid de re publica a finitimis rumore aut fama acceperit , uti ad magistratum deferat neve cum quo alio communicet , quod saepe homines temerarios atque imperitos falsis rumoribus terreri et ad facinus impelli et de summis rebus consilium capere cognitum est . <end>$$Those states which are considered to conduct their commonwealth more judiciously , have it ordained by their laws , that , if any person shall have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any thing concerning the commonwealth , he shall convey it to the magistrate , and not impart it to any other ; because it has been discovered that inconsiderate and inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports , and driven to some rash act , or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance .
<start> Magistratus quae visa sunt occultant quaeque esse ex usu iudicaverunt multitudini produnt . <end>$$The magistrates conceal those things which require to be kept unknown ; and they disclose to the people whatever they determine to be expedient .
<start> De re publica nisi per concilium loqui non conceditur . <end>$$It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth , except in council .
<start> Germani multum ab hac consuetudine differunt Nam neque druides habent , qui rebus divinis praesint , neque sacrificiis student . <end>$$The Germans differ much from these usages , for they have neither Druids to preside over sacred offices , nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices .
<start> Deorum numero eos solos ducunt , quos cernunt et quorum aperte opibus iuvantur , Solem et Vulcanum et Lunam , reliquos ne fama quidem acceperunt . <end>$$They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold , and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited , namely , the sun , fire , and the moon ; they have not heard of the other deities even by report .
<start> Vita omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei militaris consistit : ab parvulis labori ac duritiae student . <end>$$Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art ; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships .
<start> Qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt , maximam inter suos ferunt laudem : hoc ali staturam , ali vires nervosque confirmari putant . <end>$$Those who have remained chaste for the longest time , receive the greatest commendation among their people ; they think that by this the growth is promoted , by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened .
<start> Intra annum vero vicesimum feminae notitiam habuisse in turpissimis habent rebus ; cuius rei nulla est occultatio , quod et promiscue in fluminibus perluuntur et pellibus aut parvis renonum tegimentis utuntur magna corporis parte nuda . <end>$$And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts ; of which matter there is no concealment , because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides , a large portion of the body being in consequence naked .
<start> Agriculturae non student , maiorque pars eorum victus in lacte , caseo , carne consistit Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet proprios ; sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos gentibus cognationibusque hominum , qui una coierunt , quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio transire cogunt . <end>$$They do not pay much attention to agriculture , and a large portion of their food consists in milk , cheese , and flesh ; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits ; but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families , who have united together , as much land as , and in the place in which , they think proper , and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere .
<start> Eius rei multas adferunt causas : ne adsidua consuetudine capti studium belli gerendi agricultura commutent ; ne latos fines parare studeant , potentioresque humiliores possessionibus expellant ; ne accuratius ad frigora atque aestus vitandos aedificent ; ne qua oriatur pecuniae cupiditas , qua ex re factiones dissensionesque nascuntur ; ut animi aequitate plebem contineant , cum suas quisque opes cum potentissimis aequari videat . <end>$$For this enactment they advance many reasons-lest seduced by long-continued custom , they may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture ; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estates , and the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions ; lest they construct their houses with too great a desire to avoid cold and heat ; lest the desire of wealth spring up , from which cause divisions and discords arise ; and that they may keep the common people in a contented state of mind , when each sees his own means placed on an equality with the most powerful .
<start> Civitatibus maxima laus est quam latissime circum se vastatis finibus solitudines habere . <end>$$It is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide deserts as possible around them , their frontiers having been laid waste .
<start> Hoc proprium virtutis existimant , expulsos agris finitimos cedere , neque quemquam prope audere consistere ; simul hoc se fore tutiores arbitrantur repentinae incursionis timore sublato . <end>$$They consider this the real evidence of their prowess , that their neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them , and that no one dare settle near them ; at the same time they think that they shall be on that account the more secure , because they have removed the apprehension of a sudden incursion .
<start> Cum bellum civitas aut illatum defendit aut infert , magistratus , qui ei bello praesint , ut vitae necisque habeant potestatem , deliguntur . <end>$$When a state either repels war waged against it , or wages it against another , magistrates are chosen to preside over that war with such authority , that they have power of life and death .
<start> In pace nullus est communis magistratus , sed principes regionum atque pagorum inter suos ius dicunt controversiasque minuunt . <end>$$In peace there is no common magistrate , but the chiefs of provinces and cantons administer justice and determine controversies among their own people .
<start> Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam , quae extra fines cuiusque civitatis fiunt , atque ea iuventutis exercendae ac desidiae minuendae causa fieri praedicant . <end>$$Robberies which are committed beyond the boundaries of each state bear no infamy , and they avow that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining their youth and of preventing sloth .
<start> Atque ubi quis ex principibus in concilio dixit se ducem fore , qui sequi velint , profiteantur , consurgunt ei qui et causam et hominem probant suumque auxilium pollicentur atque ab multitudine collaudantur : qui ex his secuti non sunt , in desertorum ac proditorum numero ducuntur , omniumque his rerum postea fides derogatur . <end>$$And when any of their chiefs has said in an assembly that he will be their leader , let those who are willing to follow , give in their names ; they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise and promise their assistance and are applauded by the people ; such of them as have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters and traitors , and confidence in all matters is afterward refused them .
<start> Hospitem violare fas non putant ; qui quacumque de causa ad eos venerunt , ab iniuria prohibent , sanctos habent , hisque omnium domus patent victusque communicatur . <end>$$To injure guests they regard as impious ; they defend from wrong those who have come to them for any purpose whatever , and esteem them inviolable ; to them the houses of all are open and maintenance is freely supplied .
<start> Ac fuit antea tempus , cum Germanos Galli virtute superarent , ultro bella inferrent , propter hominum multitudinem agrique inopiam trans Rhenum colonias mitterent . <end>$$And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans in prowess , and waged war on them offensively , and , on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land , sent colonies over the Rhine .
<start> Itaque ea quae fertilissima Germaniae sunt loca circum Hercyniam silvam , quam Eratostheni et quibusdam Graecis fama notam esse video , quam illi Orcyniam appellant , Volcae Tectosages occupaverunt atque ibi consederunt ; quae gens ad hoc tempus his sedibus sese continet summamque habet iustitiae et bellicae laudis opinionem . <end>$$Accordingly , the Volcae Tectosages , seized on those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful around the Hercynian forest , , and settled there Which nation to this time retains its position in those settlements , and has a very high character for justice and military merit ; now also they continue in the same scarcity , indigence , hardihood , as the Germans , and use the same food and dress ; but their proximity to the Province and knowledge of commodities from countries beyond the sea supplies to the Gauls many things tending to luxury as well as civilization .
<start> Huius Hercyniae silvae , quae supra demonstrata est , latitudo novem dierum iter expedito patet : non enim aliter finiri potest , neque mensuras itinerum noverunt . <end>$$The breadth of this Hercynian forest , which has been referred to above , is to a quick traveler , a journey of nine days .
<start> Est bos cervi figura , cuius a media fronte inter aures unum cornu exsistit excelsius magisque directum his , quae nobis nota sunt , cornibus : ab eius summo sicut palmae ramique late divunduntur . <end>$$There is an ox of the shape of a stag , between whose ears a horn rises from the middle of the forehead , higher and straighter than those horns which are known to us .
<start> Sunt item , quae appellantur alces . <end>$$There are also which are called elks .
<start> Harum est consimilis capris figura et varietas pellium , sed magnitudine paulo antecedunt mutilaeque sunt cornibus et crura sine nodis articulisque habent neque quietis causa procumbunt neque , si quo adflictae casu conciderunt , erigere sese aut sublevare possunt . <end>$$The shape of these , and the varied color of their skins , is much like roes , but in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns , and have legs without joints and ligatures ; nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest , nor , if they have been thrown down by any accident , can they raise or lift themselves up .
<start> His sunt arbores pro cubilibus : ad eas se applicant atque ita paulum modo reclinatae quietem capiunt Quarum ex vestigiis cum est animadversum a venatoribus , quo se recipere consuerint , omnes eo loco aut ab radicibus subruunt aut accidunt arbores , tantum ut summa species earum stantium relinquatur . <end>$$Trees serve as beds to them ; they lean themselves against them , and thus reclining only slightly , they take their rest ; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves , they either undermine all the trees at the roots , or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be left standing .
<start> Huc cum se consuetudine reclinaverunt , infirmas arbores pondere adfligunt atque una ipsae concidunt . <end>$$When they have leant upon them , according to their habit , they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees , and fall down themselves along with them .
<start> Tertium est genus eorum , qui uri appellantur . <end>$$There is a third kind , consisting of those animals which are called uri .
<start> Hi sunt magnitudine paulo infra elephantos , specie et colore et figura tauri . <end>$$These are a little below the elephant in size , and of the appearance , color , and shape of a bull .
<start> Magna vis eorum est et magna velocitas , neque homini neque ferae quam conspexerunt parcunt . <end>$$Their strength and speed are extraordinary ; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied .
<start> Hos studiose foveis captos interficiunt . <end>$$These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them .
<start> Hoc se labore durant adulescentes atque hoc genere venationis exercent , et qui plurimos ex his interfecerunt , relatis in publicum cornibus , quae sint testimonio , magnam ferunt laudem . <end>$$The young men harden themselves with this exercise , and practice themselves in this kind of hunting , and those who have slain the greatest number of them , having produced the horns in public , to serve as evidence , receive great praise .
<start> Sed adsuescere ad homines et mansuefieri ne parvuli quidem excepti possunt . <end>$$But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed .
<start> Amplitudo cornuum et figura et species multum a nostrorum boum cornibus differt . <end>$$The size , shape , and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen .
<start> Haec studiose conquisita ab labris argento circumcludunt atque in amplissimis epulis pro poculis utuntur . <end>$$These they anxiously seek after , and bind at the tips with silver , and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments .
<start> Caesar , postquam per Vbios exploratores comperit Suebos sese in silvas recepisse , inopiam frumenti veritus , quod , ut supra demonstravimus , minime omnes Germani agriculturae student , constituit non progredi longius ; sed , ne omnino metum reditus sui barbaris tolleret atque ut eorum auxilia tardaret , reducto exercitu partem ultimam pontis , quae ripas Vbiorum contingebat , in longitudinem pedum ducentorum rescindit atque in extremo ponte turrim tabulatorum quattuor constituit praesidiumque cohortium duodecim pontis tuendi causa ponit magnisque eum locum munitionibus firmat . <end>$$Caesar , after he discovered through the Ubian scouts that the Suevi had retired into their woods , apprehending a scarcity of corn , because , as we have observed above , all the Germans pay very little attention to agriculture , resolved not to proceed any further ; but , that he might not altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his return , and that he might delay their succors , having led back his army , he breaks down , to the length of 200 feet , the further end of the bridge , which joined the banks of the Ubii , and at the extremity of the bridge raises towers of four stories , and stations a guard of twelve cohorts for the purpose of defending the bridge , and strengthens the place with considerable fortifications .
<start> Ei loco praesidioque Gaium Volcatium Tullum adulescentem praefecit . <end>$$Over that fort and guard he appointed C .
<start> Ipse , cum maturescere frumenta inciperent , ad bellum Ambiorigis profectus per Arduennam silvam , quae est totius Galliae maxima atque ab ripis Rheni finibusque Treverorum ad Nervios pertinet milibusque amplius quingentis in longitudinem patet , Lucium Minucium Basilum cum omni equitatu praemittit , si quid celeritate itineris atque opportunitate temporis proficere possit ; monet , ut ignes in castris fieri prohibeat , ne qua eius adventus procul significatio fiat : sese confestim subsequi dicit . <end>$$Volcatius Tullus , a young man ; he himself , when the corn began to ripen , having set forth for the war with Ambiorix , he sends forward L Minucius Basilus with all the cavalry , to try if he might gain any advantage by rapid marches and the advantage of time , he warns him to forbid fires being made in the camp , lest any indication of his approach be given at a distance : he tells him that he will follow immediately .
<start> Basilus , ut imperatum est , facit Celeriter contraque omnium opinionem confecto itinere multos in agris inopinantes deprehendit : eorum indicio ad ipsum Ambiorigem contendit , quo in loco cum paucis equitibus esse dicebatur . <end>$$Basilus does as he was commanded ; having performed his march rapidly , and even surpassed the expectations of all , he surprises in the fields many not expecting him ; through their information he advances toward Ambiorix himself , to the place in which he was said to be with a few horse .
<start> Multum cum in omnibus rebus tum in re militari potest fortuna . <end>$$Fortune accomplishes much , not only in other matters , but also in the art of war .
<start> Nam magno accidit casu ut in ipsum incautum etiam atque imparatum incideret , priusque eius adventus ab omnibus videretur , quam fama ac nuntius adferretur : sic magnae fuit fortunae omni militari instrumento , quod circum se habebat , erepto , raedis equisque comprehensis ipsum effugere mortem . <end>$$For as it happened by a remarkable chance , that he fell upon himself unguarded and unprepared , and that his arrival was seen by the people before the report or information of his arrival was carried thither ; so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that , although every implement of war which he was accustomed to have about him was seized , and his chariots and horses surprised , yet he himself escaped death .
<start> Sed hoc quoque factum est , quod aedificio circumdato silva , ut sunt fere domicilia Gallorum , qui vitandi aestus causa plerumque silvarum atque fluminum petunt propinquitates , comites familiaresque eius angusto in loco paulisper equitum nostrorum vim sustinuerunt . <end>$$But it was effected owing to this circumstance , that his house being surrounded by a wood , his attendants and friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time the attack of our horse .
<start> His pugnantibus illum in equum quidam ex suis intulit : fugientem silvae texerunt . <end>$$While they were fighting , one of his followers mounted him on a horse ; the woods sheltered him as he fled .
<start> Sic et ad subeundum periculum et ad vitandum multum fortuna valuit . <end>$$Thus fortune tended much both toward his encountering and his escaping danger .
<start> Ambiorix copias suas iudicione non conduxerit , quod proelio dimicandum non existimarit , an tempore exclusus et repentino equitum adventu prohibitus , cum reliquum exercitum subsequi crederet , dubium est Sed certe dimissis per agros nuntiis sibi quemque consulere iussit Quorum pars in Arduennam silvam , pars in continentes paludes profugit ; qui proximi Oceano fuerunt , his insulis sese occultaverunt , quas aestus efficere consuerunt : multi ex suis finibus egressi se suaque omnia alienissimis crediderunt . <end>$$Whether Ambiorix did not collect his forces from cool deliberation , because he considered he ought not to engage in a battle , or he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden arrival of our horse , when he supposed the rest of the army was closely following , is doubtful : but certainly , dispatching messengers through the country , he ordered every one to provide for himself ; and a part of them fled into the forest Arduenna , a part into the extensive morasses ; those who were nearest the ocean concealed themselves in the islands which the tides usually form ; many , departing from their territories , committed themselves and all their possessions to perfect strangers .
<start> Catuvolcus , rex dimidiae partis Eburonum , qui una cum Ambiorige consilium inierat , aetate iam confectus , cum laborem aut belli aut fugae ferre non posset , omnibus precibus detestatus Ambiorigem , qui eius consilii auctor fuisset , taxo , cuius magna in Gallia Germaniaque copia est , se exanimavit . <end>$$Cativolcus , king of one half of the Eburones , who had entered into the design together with Ambiorix , since , being now worn out by age , he was unable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight , having cursed Ambiorix with every imprecation , as the person who had been the contriver of that measure , destroyed himself with the juice of the yew-tree , of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and Germany .
<start> Segni Condrusique , ex gente et numero Germanorum , qui sunt inter Eburones Treverosque , legatos ad Caesarem miserunt oratum , ne se in hostium numero duceret neve omnium Germanorum , qui essent citra Rhenum , unam esse causam iudicaret : nihil se de bello cogitavisse , nulla Ambiorigi auxilia misisse . <end>$$The Segui and Condrusi , of the nation and number of the Germans , and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri , sent embassadors to Caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies , nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the Rhine was one and the same ; that they had formed no plans of war , and had sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix .
<start> Caesar explorata re quaestione captivorum , si qui ad eos Eburones ex fuga convenissent , ad se ut reducerentur , imperavit ; si ita fecissent , fines eorum se violaturum negavit . <end>$$Caesar , having ascertained this fact by an examination of his prisoners , commanded that if any of the Eburones in their flight had repaired to them , they should be sent back to him ; he assures them that if they did that , he will not injure their territories .
<start> Tum copiis in tres partes distributis impedimenta omnium legionum Aduatucam contulit . <end>$$Then , having divided his forces into three parts , he sent the baggage of all the legions to Aduatuca .
<start> Id castelli nomen est . <end>$$That is the name of a fort .
<start> Hoc fere est in mediis Eburonum finibus , ubi Titurius atque Aurunculeius hiemandi causa consederant . <end>$$This is nearly in the middle of the Eburones , where Titurius and Aurunculeius had been quartered for the purpose of wintering .
<start> Hunc cum reliquis rebus locum probabat , tum quod superioris anni munitiones integrae manebant , ut militum laborem sublevaret . <end>$$This place he selected as well on other accounts as because the fortifications of the previous year remained , in order that he might relieve the labor of the soldiers .
<start> Praesidio impedimentis legionem quartamdecimam reliquit , unam ex eis tribus , quas proxime conscriptas ex Italia traduxerat . <end>$$He left the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage , one of those three which he had lately raised in Italy and brought over .
<start> Ei legioni castrisque Quintum Tullium Ciceronem praeficit ducentosque equites attribuit . <end>$$Over that legion and camp he places Q Tullius Cicero and gives him 200 horse .
<start> Partito exercitu Titum Labienum cum legionibus tribus ad Oceanum versus in eas partes quae Menapios attingunt proficisci iubet ; Gaium Trebonium cum pari legionum numero ad eam regionem quae ad Aduatucos adiacet depopulandam mittit ; ipse cum reliquis tribus ad flumen Scaldem , quod influit in Mosam , extremasque Arduennae partis ire constituit , quo cum paucis equitibus profectum Ambiorigem audiebat . <end>$$Having divided the army , he orders T Labienus to proceed with three legions toward the ocean into those parts which border on the Menapii ; he sends C Trebonius with a like number of legions to lay waste that district which lies contiguous to the Aduatuci ; he himself determines to go with the remaining three to the river Sambre , which flows into the Meuse , and to the most remote parts of Arduenna , whither he heard that Ambiorix had gone with a few horse .
<start> Discedens post diem septimum sese reversurum confirmat ; quam ad diem ei legioni quae in praesidio relinquebatur deberi frumentum sciebat . <end>$$When departing , he promises that he will return before the end of the seventh day , on which day he was aware corn was due to that legion which was being left in garrison .
<start> Labienum Treboniumque hortatur , si rei publicae commodo facere possint , ad eum diem revertantur , ut rursus communicato consilio exploratisque hostium rationibus aliud initium belli capere possint . <end>$$He directs Labienus and Trebonius to return by the same day , if they can do so agreeably to the interests of the republic ; so that their measures having been mutually imparted , and the plans of the enemy having been discovered , they might be able to commence a different line of operations .
<start> Erat , ut supra demonstravimus , manus certa nulla , non oppidum , non praesidium , quod se armis defenderet , sed in omnes partes dispersa multitudo . <end>$$There was , as we have above observed , no regular army , nor a town , nor a garrison which could defend itself by arms ; but the people were scattered in all directions .
<start> Vbi cuique aut valles abdita aut locus silvestris aut palus impedita spem praesidi aut salutis aliquam offerebat , consederat . <end>$$Where either a hidden valley , or a woody spot , or a difficult morass furnished any hope of protection or of security to any one , there he had fixed himself .
<start> Haec loca vicinitatibus erant nota , magnamque res diligentiam requirebat non in summa exercitus tuenda (nullum enim poterat universis perterritis ac dispersis periculum accidere) , sed in singulis militibus conservandis ; quae tamen ex parte res ad salutem exercitus pertinebat . <end>$$These places were known to those who dwelt in the neighborhood , and the matter demanded great attention , not so much in protecting the main body of the army , as in preserving individual soldiers ; which in some measure tended to the safety of the army .
<start> Nam et praedae cupiditas multos longius evocabat , et silvae incertis occultisque itineribus confertos adire prohibebant . <end>$$For both the desire of booty was leading many too far , and the woods with their unknown and hidden routes would not allow them to go in large bodies .
<start> Si negotium confici stirpemque hominum sceleratorum interfici vellet , dimittendae plures manus diducendique erant milites ; si continere ad signa manipulos vellet , ut instituta ratio et consuetudo exercitus Romani postulabat , locus ipse erat praesidio barbaris , neque ex occulto insidiandi et dispersos circumveniendi singulis deerat audacia . <end>$$If he desired the business to be completed and the race of those infamous people to be cut off , more bodies of men must be sent in several directions and the soldiers must be detached on all sides ; if he were disposed to keep the companies at their standards , as the established discipline and practice of the Roman army required , the situation itself was a safeguard to the barbarians , nor was there wanting to individuals the daring to lay secret ambuscades and beset scattered soldiers .
<start> Vt in eiusmodi difficultatibus , quantum diligentia provideri poterat providebatur , ut potius in nocendo aliquid praetermitteretur , etsi omnium animi ad ulciscendum ardebant , quam cum aliquo militum detrimento noceretur . <end>$$But amid difficulties of this nature as far as precautions could be taken by vigilance , such precautions were taken ; so that some opportunities of injuring the enemy were neglected , though the minds of all were burning to take revenge , rather than that injury should be effected with any loss to our soldiers .
<start> Dimittit ad finitimas civitates nuntios Caesar : omnes ad se vocat spe praedae ad diripiendos Eburones , ut potius in silvis Gallorum vita quam legionarius miles periclitetur , simul ut magna multitudine circumfusa pro tali facinore stirps ac nomen civitatis tollatur . <end>$$Caesar dispatches messengers to the neighboring states ; by the hope of booty he invites all to him , for the purpose of plundering the Eburones , in order that the life of the Gauls might be hazarded in the woods rather than the legionary soldiers ; at the same time , in order that a large force being drawn around them , the race and name of that state may be annihilated for such a crime .
<start> Magnus undique numerus celeriter convenit . <end>$$A large number from all quarters speedily assembles .
<start> Haec in omnibus Eburonum partibus gerebantur , diesque appetebat septimus , quem ad diem Caesar ad impedimenta legionemque reverti constituerat . <end>$$These things were going on in all parts of the territories of the Eburones , and the seventh day was drawing near , by which day Caesar had purposed to return to the baggage and the legion .
<start> Hic quantum in bello fortuna possit et quantos adferat casus cognosci potuit . <end>$$Here it might be learned how much fortune achieves in war , and how great casualties she produces .
<start> Dissipatis ac perterritis hostibus , ut demonstravimus , manus erat nulla quae parvam modo causam timoris adferret . <end>$$The enemy having been scattered and alarmed , as we related above , there was no force which might produce even a slight occasion of fear .
<start> Trans Rhenum ad Germanos pervenit fama , diripi Eburones atque ultro omnes ad praedam evocari . <end>$$The report extends beyond the Rhine to the Germans that the Eburones are being pillaged , and that all were without distinction invited to the plunder .
<start> Cogunt equitum duo milia Sugambri , qui sunt proximi Rheno , a quibus receptos ex fuga Tencteros atque Vsipetes supra docuimus Transeunt Rhenum navibus ratibusque triginta milibus passuum infra eum locum , ubi pons erat perfectus praesidiumque ab Caesare relictum : primos Eburonum fines adeunt ; multos ex fuga dispersos excipiunt , magno pecoris numero , cuius sunt cupidissimi barbari , potiuntur . <end>$$The Sigambri , who are nearest to the Rhine , by whom , we have mentioned above , the Tenchtheri and Usipetes were received after their retreat , collect 2 , 000 horse ; they cross the Rhine in ships and barks thirty miles below that place where the bridge was entire and the garrison left by Caesar ; they arrive at the frontiers of the Eburones , surprise many who were scattered in flight , and get possession of a large amount of cattle , of which barbarians are extremely covetous .
<start> Invitati praeda longius procedunt Non hos palus in bello latrociniisque natos , non silvae morantur Quibus in locis sit Caesar ex captivis quaerunt ; profectum longius reperiunt omnemque exercitum discessisse cognoscunt . <end>$$Allured by booty , they advance further ; neither morass nor forest obstructs these men , born amid war and depredations ; they inquire of their prisoners in what part Caesar is ; they find that he has advanced further , and learn that all the army has removed .
<start> Atque unus ex captivis Quid vos , inquit , hanc miseram ac tenuem sectamini praedam , quibus licet iam esse fortunatissimos ? Tribus horis Aduatucam venire potestis : huc omnes suas fortunas exercitus Romanorum contulit : praesidi tantum est , ut ne murus quidem cingi possit , neque quisquam egredi extra munitiones audeat . <end>$$Thereon one of the prisoners says , Why do you pursue such wretched and trifling spoil ; you , to whom it is granted to become even now most richly endowed by fortune ? In three hours you can reach Aduatuca ; there the Roman army has deposited all its fortunes ; there is so little of a garrison that not even the wall can be manned , nor dare any one go beyond the fortifications .
<start> Oblata spe Germani quam nacti erant praedam in occulto relinquunt ; ipsi Aduatucam contendunt usi eodem duce , cuius haec indicio cognoverant . <end>$$A hope having been presented them , the Germans leave in concealment the plunder they had acquired ; they themselves hasten to Aduatuca , employing as their guide the same man by whose information they had become informed of these things .
<start> Cicero , qui omnes superiores dies praeceptis Caesaris cum summa diligentia milites in castris continuisset ac ne calonem quidem quemquam extra munitionem egredi passus esset , septimo die diffidens de numero dierum Caesarem fidem servaturum , quod longius progressum audiebat , neque ulla de reditu eius fama adferebatur , simul eorum permotus vocibus , qui illius patientiam paene obsessionem appellabant , siquidem ex castris egredi non liceret , nullum eiusmodi casum exspectans , quo novem oppositis legionibus maximoque equitatu dispersis ac paene deletis hostibus in milibus passuum tribus offendi posset , quinque cohortes frumentatum in proximas segetes mittit , quas inter et castra unus omnino collis intererat . <end>$$Cicero , who during all the foregoing days had kept his soldiers in camp with the greatest exactness , and agreeable to the injunctions of Caesar , had not permitted even any of the camp-followers to go beyond the fortification , distrusting on the seventh day that Caesar would keep his promise as to the number of days , because he heard that he had proceeded further , and no report as to his return was brought to him , and being urged at the same time by the expressions of those who called his tolerance almost a siege , if , forsooth , it was not permitted them to go out of the camp , since he might expect no disaster , whereby he could be injured , within three miles of the camp , while nine legions and all the cavalry were under arms , and the enemy scattered and almost annihilated , sent five cohorts into the neighboring corn-lands , between which and the camp only one hill intervened , for the purpose of foraging .
<start> Complures erant ex legionibus aegri relicti ; ex quibus qui hoc spatio dierum convaluerant , circiter CCC , sub vexillo una mittuntur ; magna praeterea multitudo calonum , magna vis iumentorum , quae in castris subsederant , facta potestate sequitur . <end>$$Many soldiers of the legions had been left invalided in the camp , of whom those who had recovered in this space of time , being about 300 , are sent together under one standard ; a large number of soldiers' attendants besides , with a great number of beasts of burden , which had remained in the camp , permission being granted , follow them .
<start> Hoc ipso tempore et casu Germani equites interveniunt protinusque eodem illo , quo venerant , cursu ab decumana porta in castra irrumpere conantur , nec prius sunt visi obiectis ab ea parte silvis , quam castris appropinquarent , usque eo ut qui sub vallo tenderent mercatores recipiendi sui facultatem non haberent . <end>$$At this very time , the German horse by chance came up , and immediately , with the same speed with which they had advanced , attempt to force the camp at the Decuman gate , nor were they seen , in consequence of woods lying in the way on that side , before they were just reaching the camp : so much so , that the sutlers who had their booths under the rampart had not an opportunity of retreating within the camp .
<start> Inopinantes nostri re nova perturbantur , ac vix primum impetum cohors in statione sustinet . <end>$$Our men , not anticipating it , are perplexed by the sudden affair , and the cohort on the outpost scarcely sustains the first attack .
<start> Circumfunduntur ex reliquis hostes partibus , si quem aditum reperire possent . <end>$$The enemy spread themselves on the other sides to ascertain if they could find any access .
<start> Aegre portas nostri tuentur , reliquos aditus locus ipse per se munitioque defendit . <end>$$Our men with difficulty defend the gates ; the very position of itself and the fortification secures the other accesses .
<start> Totis trepidatur castris , atque alius ex alio causam tumultus quaerit ; neque quo signa ferantur neque quam in partem quisque conveniat provident . <end>$$There is a panic in the entire camp , and one inquires of another the cause of the confusion , nor do they readily determine whither the standards should be borne , nor into what quarter each should betake himself .
<start> Alius iam castra capta pronuntiat , alius deleto exercitu atque imperatore victores barbaros venisse contendit ; plerique novas sibi ex loco religiones fingunt Cottaeque et Tituri calamitatem , qui in eodem occiderint castello , ante oculos ponunt . <end>$$One avows that the camp is already taken , another maintains that , the enemy having destroyed the army and commander-in-chief , are come hither as conquerors ; most form strange superstitious fancies from the spot , and place before their eyes the catastrophe of Cotta and Titurius , who had fallen in the same fort .
<start> Tali timore omnibus perterritis confirmatur opinio barbaris , ut ex captivo audierant , nullum esse intus praesidium . <end>$$All being greatly disconcerted by this alarm , the belief of the barbarians is strengthened that there is no garrison within , as they had heard from their prisoner .
<start> Perrumpere nituntur seque ipsi adhortantur , ne tantam fortunam ex manibus dimittant . <end>$$They endeavor to force an entrance and encourage one another not to cast from their hands so valuable a prize .
<start> Erat aeger cum praesidio relictus Publius Sextius Baculus , qui primum pilum ad Caesarem duxerat , cuius mentionem superioribus proeliis fecimus , ac diem iam quintum cibo caruerat . <end>$$P Sextius Baculus , who had led a principal century under Caesar , had been left an invalid in the garrison , and had now been five days without food .
<start> Hic diffisus suae atque omnium saluti inermis ex tabernaculo prodit : videt imminere hostes atque in summo esse rem discrimine : capit arma a proximis atque in porta consistit . <end>$$He , distrusting his own safety and that of all , goes forth from his tent unarmed ; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is in the utmost danger ; he snatches arms from those nearest , and stations himself at the gate .
<start> Consequuntur hunc centuriones eius cohortis quae in statione erat : paulisper una proelium sustinent . <end>$$The centurions of that cohort which was on guard follow him ; for a short time they sustain the fight together .
<start> Relinquit animus Sextium gravibus acceptis vulneribus : aegre per manus tractus servatur . <end>$$Sextius faints , after receiving many wounds ; he is with difficulty saved , drawn away by the hands of the soldiers .
<start> Hoc spatio interposito reliqui sese confirmant tantum , ut in munitionibus consistere audeant speciemque defensorum praebeant . <end>$$This space having intervened , the others resume courage so far as to venture to take their place on the fortifications and present the aspect of defenders .
<start> Interim confecta frumentatione milites nostri clamorem exaudiunt : praecurrunt equites ; quanto res sit in periculo cognoscunt . <end>$$The foraging having in the mean time been completed , our soldiers distinctly hear the shout ; the horse hasten on before and discover in what danger the affair is .
<start> Hic vero nulla munitio est quae perterritos recipiat : modo conscripti atque usus militaris imperiti ad tribunum militum centurionesque ora convertunt ; quid ab his praecipiatur exspectant . <end>$$But here there is no fortification to receive them , in their alarm : those last enlisted , and unskilled in military discipline turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions ; they wait to find what orders may be given by them .
<start> Nemo est tam fortis quin rei novitate perturbetur . <end>$$No one is so courageous as not to be disconcerted by the suddenness of the affair .
<start> Barbari signa procul conspicati oppugnatione desistunt : redisse primo legiones credunt , quas longius discessisse ex captivis cognoverant ; postea despecta paucitate ex omnibus partibus impetum faciunt . <end>$$The barbarians , espying our standard in the distance , desist from the attack ; at first they suppose that the legions , which they had learned from their prisoners had removed further off , had returned ; afterward , despising their small number , they make an attack on them at all sides .
<start> Calones in proximum tumulum procurrunt Hinc celeriter deiecti se in signa manipulosque coniciunt : eo magis timidos perterrent milites . <end>$$The camp-followers run forward to the nearest rising ground ; being speedily driven from this they throw themselves among the standards and companies : they thus so much the more alarm the soldiers already affrighted .
<start> Alii cuneo facto ut celeriter perrumpant censent , quoniam tam propinqua sint castra , et si pars aliqua circumventa ceciderit , at reliquos servari posse confidunt ; alii , ut in iugo consistant atque eundem omnes ferant casum . <end>$$Some propose that , forming a wedge , they suddenly break through , since the camp was so near ; and if any part should be surrounded and slain , they fully trust that at least the rest may be saved ; others , that they take their stand on an eminence , and all undergo the same destiny .
<start> Hoc veteres non probant milites , quos sub vexillo una profectos docuimus . <end>$$The veteran soldiers whom we stated to have set out together under a standard , do not approve of this .
<start> Itaque inter se cohortati duce Gaio Trebonio , equite Romano , qui eis erat praepositus , per medios hostes perrumpunt incolumesque ad unum omnes in castra perveniunt . <end>$$Therefore encouraging each other , under the conduct of Caius Trebonius , a Roman knight , who had been appointed over them , they break through the midst of the enemy , and arrive in the camp safe to a man .
<start> Hos subsecuti calones equitesque eodem impetu militum virtute servantur . <end>$$The camp attendants and the horse following close upon them with the same impetuosity , are saved by the courage of the soldiers .
<start> At ei qui in iugo constiterant , nullo etiam nunc usu rei militaris percepto neque in eo quod probaverant consilio permanere , ut se loco superiore defenderent , neque eam quam prodesse aliis vim celeritatemque viderant imitari potuerunt , sed se in castra recipere conati iniquum in locum demiserunt . <end>$$But those who had taken their stand upon the eminence having even now acquired no experience of military matters , neither could persevere in that resolution which they approved of , namely , to defend themselves from their higher position , nor imitate that vigor and speed which they had observed to have availed others ; but , attempting to reach the camp , had descended into an unfavorable situation .
<start> Centuriones , quorum nonnulli ex inferioribus ordinibus reliquarum legionum virtutis causa in superiores erant ordines huius legionis traducti , ne ante partam rei militaris laudem amitterent , fortissime pugnantes conciderunt . <end>$$The centurions , some of whom had been promoted for their valor from the lower ranks of other legions to higher ranks in this legion , in order that they might not forfeit their glory for military exploits previously acquired , fell together fighting most valiantly .
<start> Militum pars horum virtute summotis hostibus praeter spem incolumis in castra pervenit , pars a barbaris circumventa periit . <end>$$The enemy having been dislodged by their valor , a part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their expectations ; a part perished , surrounded by the barbarians .
<start> Germani desperata expugnatione castrorum , quod nostros iam constitisse in munitionibus videbant , cum ea praeda quam in silvis deposuerant trans Rhenum sese receperunt . <end>$$The Germans , despairing of taking the camp by storm , because they saw that our men had taken up their position on the fortifications , retreated beyond the Rhine with that plunder which they had deposited in the woods .
<start> Sic omnino animos timor praeoccupaverat ut paene alienata mente deletis omnibus copiis equitatum se ex fuga recepisse dicerent neque in columi exercitu Germanos castra oppugnaturos fuisse contenderent . <end>$$Volusenus , who had been sent with the cavalry , arrived that night , he could not gain credence that Caesar was close at hand with his army safe .
<start> Reversus ille eventus belli non ignorans unum , quod cohortes ex statione et praesidio essent emissae , questus ne minimo quidem casu locum relinqui debuisse , multum fortunam in repentino hostium adventu potuisse iudicavit , multo etiam amplius , quod paene ab ipso vallo portisque castrorum barbaros avertisset . <end>$$He , on his return , being well aware of the casualties of war , complained of one thing , namely , that the cohorts had been sent away from the outposts and garrison , and pointed out that room ought not to have been left for even the most trivial casualty ; that fortune had exercised great influence in the sudden arrival of their enemy ; much greater , in that she had turned the barbarians away from the very rampart and gates of the camp .
<start> Quarum omnium rerum maxime admirandum videbatur , quod Germani , qui eo consilio Rhenum transierant , ut Ambiorigis fines depopularentur , ad castra Romanorum delati optatissimum Ambiorigi beneficium obtulerunt . <end>$$Of all which events , it seemed the most surprising , that the Germans , who had crossed the Rhine with this object , that they might plunder the territories of Ambiorix , being led to the camp of the Romans , rendered Ambiorix a most acceptable service .
<start> Caesar rursus ad vexandos hostes profectus magno coacto numero ex finitimis civitatibus in omnes partes dimittit . <end>$$Caesar , having again marched to harass the enemy , after collecting a large number from the neighboring states , dispatches them in all directions .
<start> Omnes vici atque omnia aedificia quae quisque conspexerat incendebantur ; praeda ex omnibus locis agebatur ; frumenta non solum tanta multitudine iumentorum atque hominum consumebantur , sed etiam anni tempore atque imbribus procubuerant ut , si qui etiam in praesentia se occultassent , tamen his deducto exercitu rerum omnium inopia pereundum videretur . <end>$$All the villages and all the buildings , which each beheld , were on fire : spoil was being driven off from all parts ; the corn not only was being consumed by so great numbers of cattle and men , but also had fallen to the earth , owing to the time of the year and the storms ; so that if any had concealed themselves for the present , still , it appeared likely that they must perish through want of all things , when the army should be drawn off .
<start> Ac saepe in eum locum ventum est tanto in omnes partes diviso equitatu , ut modo visum ab se Ambiorigem in fuga circumspicerent captivi nec plane etiam abisse ex conspectu contenderent , ut spe consequendi illata atque infinito labore suscepto , qui se summam ab Caesare gratiam inituros putarent , paene naturam studio vincerent , semperque paulum ad summam felicitatem defuisse videretur , atque ille latebris aut saltibus se eriperet et noctu occultatus alias regiones partesque peteret non maiore equitum praesidio quam quattuor , quibus solis vitam suam committere audebat . <end>$$And frequently it came to that point , as so large a body of cavalry had been sent abroad in all directions , that the prisoners declared Ambiorix had just then been seen by them in flight , and had not even passed out of sight , so that the hope of overtaking him being raised , and unbounded exertions having been resorted to , those who thought they should acquire the highest favor with Caesar , nearly overcame nature by their ardor , and continually , a little only seemed wanting to complete success ; but he rescued himself by lurking-places and forests , and , concealed by the night made for other districts and quarters , with no greater guard than that of four horsemen , to whom along he ventured to confide his life .
<start> Tali modo vastatis regionibus exercitum Caesar duarum cohortium damno Durocortorum Remorum reducit concilioque in eum locum Galliae indicto de coniuratione Senonum et Carnutum quaestionem habere instituit et de Accone , qui princeps eius consili fuerat , graviore sententia pronuntiata more maiorum supplicium sumpsit . <end>$$Having devastated the country in such a manner , Caesar leads back his army with the loss of two cohorts to Durocortorum of the Remi , and , having summoned a council of Gaul to assemble at that place , he resolved to hold an investigation respecting the conspiracy of the Senones and Carnutes , and having pronounced a most severe sentence upon Acco , who had been the contriver of that plot , he punished him after the custom of our ancestors .
<start> Nonnulli iudicium veriti profugerunt Quibus cum aqua atque igni interdixisset , duas legiones ad fines Treverorum , duas in Lingonibus , sex reliquas in Senonum finibus Agedinci in hibernis collocavit frumentoque exercitui proviso , ut iustituerat , in Italiam ad conventus agendos profectus est . <end>$$Some fearing a trial , fled ; when he had forbidden these fire and water , he stationed in winter quarters two legions at the frontiers of the Treviri , two among the Lingones , the remaining six at Agendicum , in the territories of the Senones ; and , having provided corn for the army , he set out for Italy , as he had determined , to hold the assizes .
<start> Quieta Gallia Caesar , ut constituerat , in Italiam ad conventus agendos proficiscitur . <end>$$Gaul being tranquil , Caesar , as he had determined , sets out for Italy to hold the provincial assizes .
<start> Ibi cognoscit de Clodii caede senatusque consulto certior factus , ut omnes iuniores Italiae coniurarent , delectum tota provincia habere instituit . <end>$$There he receives intelligence of the death of Clodius ; and , being informed of the decree of the senate , that all the youth of Italy should take the military oath , he determined to hold a levy throughout the entire province .
<start> Eae res in Galliam Transalpinam celeriter perferuntur . <end>$$Report of these events is rapidly borne into Transalpine Gaul .
<start> Addunt ipsi et ad fingunt rumoribus Galli , quod res poscere videbatur , retineri urbano motu Caesarem neque in tantis dissensionibus ad exercitum venire posse . <end>$$The Gauls themselves add to the report , and invent what the case seemed to require , that Caesar was detained by commotions in the city , and could not , amid so violent dissensions , come to his army .
<start> Hac impulsi occasione , qui iam ante se populi Romani imperio subiectos dolerent liberius atque audacius de bello consilia inire incipiunt . <end>$$Animated by this opportunity , they who already , previously to this occurrence , were indignant that they were reduced beneath the dominion of Rome , begin to organize their plans for war more openly and daringly .
<start> Indictis inter se principes Galliae conciliis silvestribus ac remotis locis queruntur de Acconis morte ; posse hunc casum ad ipsos recidere demonstrant : miserantur communem Galliae fortunam : omnibus pollicitationibus ac praemius deposcunt qui belli initium faciant et sui capitis periculo Galliam in libertatem vindicent . <end>$$The leading men of Gaul , having convened councils among themselves in the woods , and retired places , complain of the death of Acco : they point out that this fate may fall in turn on themselves : they bewail the unhappy fate of Gaul ; and by every sort of promises and rewards , they earnestly solicit some to begin the war , and assert the freedom of Gaul at the hazard of their lives .
<start> In primis rationem esse habendam dicunt , priusquam eorum clandestina consilia efferantur , ut Caesar ab exercitu intercludatur . <end>$$They say that special care should be paid to this , that Caesar should be cut off from his army before their secret plans should be divulged .
<start> Id esse facile , quod neque legiones audeant absente imperatore ex hibernis egredi , neque imperator sine praesidio ad legiones pervenire possit Postremo in acie praestare interfici quam non veterem belli gloriam libertatemque quam a maioribus acce perint recuperare . <end>$$That this was easy , because neither would the legions , in the absence of their general , dare to leave their winter quarters , nor could the general reach his army without a guard : finally , that it was better to be slain in battle , than not to recover their ancient glory in war , and that freedom which they had received from their forefathers .
<start> Vbi ea dies venit , Carnutes Cotuato et Conconnetodumno ducibus , desperatis hominibus , Cenabum signo dato concurrunt civesque Romanos , qui negotiandi causa ibi constiterant , in his Gaium Fufium Citam , honestum equitem Romanum , qui rei frumentariae iussu Caesaris praeerat , interficiunt bonaque eorum diripiunt . <end>$$When the appointed day came , the Carnutes , under the command of Cotuatus and Conetodunus , desperate men , meet together at Genabum , and slay the Roman citizens who had settled there for the purpose of trading , and plunder their property .
<start> Celeriter ad omnes Galliae civitates fama perfertur Nam ubicumque maior atque illustrior incidit res , clamore per agros regionesque significant ; hunc alii deinceps excipiunt et proximis tradunt , ut tum accidit Nam quae Cenabi oriente sole gesta essent , ante primam confectam vigiliam in finibus Arvernorum audita sunt , quod spatium est milium passuum circiter centum LX . <end>$$The report is quickly spread among all the states of Gaul ; for , whenever a more important and remarkable event takes place , they transmit the intelligence through their lands and districts by a shout ; the others take it up in succession , and pass it to their neighbors , as happened on this occasion ; for the things which were done at Genabum at sunrise , were heard in the territories of the Arverni before the end of the first watch , which is an extent of more than a hundred and sixty miles .
<start> Simili ratione ibi Vercingetorix , Celtilli filius , Arveruus , summae potentiae adulescens , cuius pater principatum Galliae totius obtinuerat et ob eam causam , quod regnum appetebat , ab civitate erat interfectus , convocatis suis clientibus facile incendit . <end>$$There in like manner , Vercingetorix the son of Celtillus the Arvernian , a young man of the highest power , summoned together his dependents , and easily excited them .
<start> Cognito eius consilio ad arma concurritur Prohibetur ab Gobannitione , patruo suo , reliquisque principibus , qui hanc temptandam fortunam non existimabant ; expellitur ex oppido Gergovia ; non destitit tamen atque in agris habet dilectum egentium ac perditorum . <end>$$On his design being made known , they rush to arms : he is expelled from the town of Gergovia , by his uncle Gobanitio and the rest of the nobles , who were of opinion , that such an enterprise ought not to be hazarded : he did not however desist , but held in the country a levy of the needy and desperate .
<start> Hac coacta manu , quoscumque adit ex civitate ad suam sententiam perducit ; hortatur ut communis libertatis causa arma capiant , magnisque coactis copiis adversarios suos a quibus paulo ante erat eiectus expellit ex civitate . <end>$$Having collected such a body of troops , he brings over to his sentiments such of his fellow-citizens as he has access to : he exhorts them to take up arms in behalf of the general freedom , and having assembled great forces he drives from the state his opponents , by whom he had been expelled a short time previously .
<start> Rex ab suis appellatur Dimittit quoque versus legationes ; obtestatur ut in fide maneant . <end>$$He is saluted king by his partisans ; he sends embassadors in every direction , he conjures them to adhere firmly to their promise .
<start> Celeriter sibi Senones , Parisios , Pictones , Cadurcos , Turonos , Aulercos , Lemovices , Andos reliquosque omnes qui Oceanum attingunt adiungit : omnium consensu ad eum defertur imperium . <end>$$He quickly attaches to his interests the Senones , Parisii , Pictones , Cadurci , Turones , Aulerci , Lemovice , and all the others who border on the ocean ; the supreme command is conferred on him by unanimous consent .
<start> Qua oblata potestate omnibus his civitatibus obsides imperat , certum numerum militum ad se celeriter adduci iubet , armorum quantum quaeque civitas domi quodque ante tempus efficiat constituit ; in primis equitatui studet . <end>$$On obtaining this authority , he demands hostages from all these states , he orders a fixed number of soldiers to be sent to him immediately ; he determines what quantity of arms each state shall prepare at home , and before what time ; he pays particular attention to the cavalry .
<start> Summae diligentiae summam imperi severitatem addit ; magnitudine supplici dubitantes cogit Nam maiore commisso delicto igni atque omnibus tormentis necat , leviore de causa auribus desectis aut singulis effossis oculis domum remittit , ut sint reliquis documento et magnitudine poenae perterreant alios . <end>$$To the utmost vigilance he adds the utmost rigor of authority ; and by the severity of his punishments brings over the wavering : for on the commission of a greater crime he puts the perpetrators to death by fire and every sort of tortures ; for a slighter cause , he sends home the offenders with their ears cut off , or one of their eyes put out , that they may be an example to the rest , and frighten others by the severity of their punishment .
<start> His suppliciis celeriter coacto exercitu Lucterium Cadurcum , summae hominem audaciae , cum parte copiarum in Rutenos mittit ; ipse in Bituriges proficiscitur . <end>$$Having quickly collected an army by their punishments , he sends Lucterius , one of the Cadurci , a man the utmost daring , with part of his forces , into the territory of the Ruteni ; and marches in person into the country of the Bituriges .
<start> Eius adventu Bituriges ad Aeduos , quorum erant in fide , legatos mittunt subsidium rogatum , quo facilius hostium copias sustinere possint . <end>$$On his arrival , the Bituriges send embassadors to the Aedui , under whose protection they were , to solicit aid in order that they might more easily resist the forces of the enemy .
<start> Aedui de consilio legatorum , quos Caesar ad exercitum reliquerat , copias equitatus peditatusque subsidio Biturigibus mittunt . <end>$$The Aedui , by the advice of the lieutenants whom Caesar had left with the army , send supplies of horse and foot to succor the Bituriges .
<start> Qui cum ad flumen Ligerim venissent , quod Bituriges ab Aeduis dividit , paucos dies ibi morati neque flumen transire ausi domum revertuntur legatisque nostris renuntiant se Biturigum perfidiam veritos revertisse , quibus id consili fuisse cognoverint , ut , si flumen transissent , una ex parte ipsi , altera Arverni se circumsisterent . <end>$$When they came to the river Loire , which separates the Bituriges from the Aedui , they delayed a few days there , and , not daring to pass the river , return home , and send back word to the lieutenants that they had returned through fear of the treachery of the Bituriges , who , they ascertained , had formed this design , that if the Aedui should cross the river , the Bituriges on the one side , and the Arverni on the other , should surround them .
<start> Id eane de causa , quam legatis pronuntiarunt , an perfidia adducti fecerint , quod nihil nobis constat , non videtur pro certo esse proponendum . <end>$$Whether they did this for the reason which they alleged to the lieutenants , or influenced by treachery , we think that we ought not to state as certain , because we have no proof .
<start> Bituriges eorum discessu statim cum Arvernis iunguntur . <end>$$On their departure , the Bituriges immediately unite themselves to the Arverni .
<start> His rebus in Italiam Caesari nuntiatis , cum iam ille urbanas res virtute Gnaeus Pompei commodiorem in statum pervenisse intellegeret , in Transalpinam Galliam profectus est . <end>$$These affairs being announced to Caesar in Italy , at the time when he understood that matters in the city had been reduced to a more tranquil state by the energy of Cneius Pompey , he set out for Transalpine Gaul .
<start> Eo cum venisset , magna difficultate adficiebatur , qua ratione ad exercitum pervenire posset . <end>$$After he had arrived there , he was greatly at a loss to know by what means he could reach his army .
<start> Nam si legiones in provinciam arcesseret , se absente in itinere proelio dimicaturas intellegebat ; si ipse ad exercitum contenderet , ne eis quidem eo tempore qui quieti viderentur suam salutem recte committi videbat . <end>$$For if he should summon the legions into the province , he was aware that on their march they would have to fight in his absence ; he foresaw too that if he himself should endeavor to reach the army , he would act injudiciously , in trusting his safety even to those who seemed to be tranquilized .
<start> Interim Lucterius Cadurcus in Rutenos missus eam civitatem Arvernis conciliat . <end>$$In the mean time Lucterius the Cadurcan , having been sent into the country of the Ruteni , gains over that state to the Arverni .
<start> Progressus in Nitiobriges et Gabalos ab utrisque obsides accipit et magna coacta manu in provinciam Narbonem versus eruptionem facere contendit . <end>$$Having advanced into the country of the Nitiobriges , and Gabali , he receives hostages from both nations , and , assembling a numerous force , marches to make a descent on the province in the direction of Narbo .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Caesar omnibus consiliis antevertendum existimavit , ut Narbonem proficisceretur . <end>$$Caesar , when this circumstance was announced to him , thought that the march to Narbo ought to take the precedence of all his other plans .
<start> Eo cum venisset , timentes confirmat , praesidia in Rutenis provincialibus , Volcis Arecomicis , Tolosatibus circumque Narbonem , quae loca hostibus erant finitima , constituit ; partem copiarum ex provincia supplementumque , quod ex Italia adduxerat , in Helvios , qui fines Arvernorum contingunt , convenire iubet . <end>$$When he arrived there , he encourages the timid and stations garrisons among the Ruteni , in the province of the Volcae Arecomici , and the country around Narbo which was in the vicinity of the enemy ; he orders a portion of the forces from the province , and the recruits which he had brought from Italy , to rendezvous among the Helvii who border on the territories of the Arverni .
<start> Etsi mons Cevenna , qui Arvernos ab Helviis discludit , durissimo tempore anni altissima nive iter impediebat , tamen discussa nive sex in altitudinem pedum atque ita viis patefactis summo militum sudore ad fines Arvernorum pervenit . <end>$$This people being surprised , because they considered themselves defended by the Cevennes as by a wall , and the paths at this season of the year had never before been passable even to individuals , he orders the cavalry to extend themselves as far as they could , and strike as great a panic as possible into the enemy .
<start> Celeriter haec fama ac nuntiis ad Vercingetorigem perferuntur ; quem perterriti omnes Arverni circumsistunt atque obsecrant , ut suis fortunis consulat , neve ab hostibus diripiautur , praesertim cum videat omne ad se bellum translatum . <end>$$Around him all the Arverni crowd in alarm , and solemnly entreat him to protect their property , and not to suffer them to be plundered by the enemy , especially as he saw that all the war was transferred into their country .
<start> Quorum ille precibus per motus castra ex Biturigibus movet in Arveruos versus . <end>$$Being prevailed upon by their entreaties he moves his camp from the country of the Bituriges in the direction of the Arverni .
<start> At Caesar biduum in his locis moratus , quod haec de Vercingetorige usu ventura opinione praeceperat , per causam supplementi equitatusque cogendi ab exercitu discedit ; Brutum adulescentem his copiis praeficit ; hunc monet , ut in omnes partes equites quam latissime pervagentur : daturum se operam , ne longius triduo ab castris absit . <end>$$Caesar , having delayed two days in that place , because he had anticipated that , in the natural course of events , such would be the conduct of Vercingetorix , leaves the army under pretense of raising recruits and cavalry : he places Brutus , a young man , in command of these forces ; he gives him instructions that the cavalry should range as extensively as possible in all directions ; that he would exert himself not to be absent from the camp longer than three days .
<start> His constitutis rebus suis inopinantibus quam maximis potest itineribus Viennam pervenit . <end>$$Having arranged these matters , he marches to Vienna by as long journeys as he can , when his own soldiers did not expect him .
<start> Ibi nactus recentem equitatum , quem multis ante diebus eo praemiserat , neque diurno neque nocturno itinere intermisso per fines Aeduorum in Lingones contendit , ubi duae legiones hiemabant , ut , si quid etiam de sua salute ab Aeduis iniretur consili , celeritate praecurreret . <end>$$Finding there a fresh body of cavalry , which he had sent on to that place several days before , marching incessantly night and day , he advanced rapidly through the territory of the Aedui into that of the Lingones , in which two legions were wintering , that , if any plan affecting his own safety should have been organized by the Aedui , he might defeat it by the rapidity of his movements .
<start> Eo cum pervenisset , ad reliquas legiones mittit priusque omnes in unum locum cogit quam de eius adventu Arvernis nuntiari posset . <end>$$When he arrived there , he sends information to the rest of the legions , and gathers all his army into one place before intelligence of his arrival could be announced to the Arverni .
<start> Hac re cognita Vercingetorix rursus in Bituriges exercitum reducit atque inde profectus Gorgobinam , Boiorum oppidum , quos ibi Helvetico proelio victos Caesar collocaverat Aeduisque attribuerat , oppugnare instituit . <end>$$Vercingetorix , on hearing this circumstance , leads back his army into the country of the Bituriges ; and after marching from it to Gergovia , a town of the Boii , whom Caesar had settled there after defeating them in the Helvetian war , and had rendered tributary to the Aedui , he determined to attack it .
<start> Magnam haec res Caesari difficultatem ad consilium capiendum adferebat , si reliquam partem hiemis uno loco legiones contineret , ne stipendiariis Aeduorum expugnatis cuncta Gallia deficeret , quod nullum amicis in eo praesidium videretur positum esse ; si maturius ex hibernis educeret , ne ab re frumentaria duris subvectionibus laboraret . <end>$$This action caused great perplexity to Caesar in the selection of his plans ; lest , if he should confine his legions in one place for the remaining portion of the winter , all Gaul should revolt when the tributaries of the Aedui were subdued , because it would appear that there was in him no protection for his friends ; but if he should draw them too soon out of their winter quarters , he might be distressed by the want of provisions , in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance .
<start> Praestare visum est tamen omnis difficultates perpeti , quam tanta contumelia accepta omnium suorum voluntates alienare . <end>$$It seemed better , however , to endure every hardship than to alienate the affections of all his allies , by submitting to such an insult .
<start> Itaque cohortatus Aeduos de supportando commeatu praemittit ad Boios qui de suo adventu doceant hortenturque ut in fide maneant atque hostium impetum magno animo sustineant . <end>$$Having , therefore , impressed on the Aedui the necessity of supplying him with provisions , he sends forward messengers to the Boii to inform them of his arrival , and encourage them to remain firm in their allegiance , and resist the attack of the enemy with great resolution .
<start> Duabus Agedinci legionibus atque impedimentis totius exer citus relictis ad Boios proficiscitur . <end>$$Having left two legions and the luggage of the entire army at Agendicum , he marches to the Boii .
<start> Altero die cum ad oppidum Senonum Vellaunodunum venisset , ne quem post se hostem relinqueret , quo expeditiore re frumentaria uteretur , oppugnare instituit idque biduo circumvallavit ; tertio die missis ex oppido legatis de deditione arma conferri , iumenta produci , sescentos obsides dari iubet . <end>$$On the second day , when he came to Vellaunodunum , a town of the Senones , he determined to attack it , in order that he might not leave an enemy in his rear , and might the more easily procure supplies of provisions , and draw a line of circumvallation around it in two days : on the third day , embassadors being sent from the town to treat of a capitulation , he orders their arms to be brought together , their cattle to be brought forth , and six hundred hostages to be given .
<start> Ea qui conficeret , a Trebonium legatum relinquit Ipse , ut quam primum iter faceret , Cenabum Carnutum proficiscitur ; qui tum primum allato nuntio de oppugnatione Vellaunoduni , cum longius eam rem ductum iri existimarent , praesidium Cenabi tuendi causa , quod eo mitterent , comparabant . <end>$$He leaves Caius Trebonius his lieutenant , to complete these arrangements ; he himself sets out with the intention of marching as soon as possible , to Genabum , a town of the Carnutes , who having then for the first time received information of the siege of Vellaunodunum , as they thought that it would be protracted to a longer time , were preparing a garrison to send to Genabum for the defense of that town .
<start> Huc biduo pervenit Castris ante oppidum positis diei tempore exclusus in posterum oppugnationem differt quaeque ad eam rem usui sint militibus imperat et , quod oppidum Cenabum pons fluminis Ligeris contingebat , veritus ne noctu ex oppido profugerent , duas legiones in armis excubare iubet . <end>$$Caesar arrived here in two days ; after pitching his camp before the town , being prevented by the time of the day , he defers the attack to the next day , and orders his soldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that enterprise ; and as a bridge over the Loire connected the town of Genabum with the opposite bank , fearing lest the inhabitants should escape by night from the town , he orders two legions to keep watch under arms .
<start> Cenabenses paulo ante mediam noctem silentio ex oppido egressi flumen transire coeperunt . <end>$$The people of Genabum came forth silently from the city before midnight , and began to cross the river .
<start> Qua re per exploratores nuntiata Caesar legiones quas expeditas esse iusserat portis incensis intromittit atque oppido potitur , perpaucis ex hostium numero desideratis quin cuncti caperentur , quod pontis atque itinerum angustiae multitudinis fugam intercluserant . <end>$$When this circumstance was announced by scouts , Caesar , having set fire to the gates , sends in the legions which he had ordered to be ready , and obtains possession of the town so completely , that very few of the whole number of the enemy escaped being taken alive , because the narrowness of the bridge and the roads prevented the multitude from escaping .
<start> Oppidum diripit atque incendit , praedam militibus donat , exercitum Ligerem traducit atque in Biturigum fines pervenit . <end>$$He pillages and burns the town , gives the booty to the soldiers , then leads his army over the Loire , and marches into the territories of the Bituriges .
<start> Vercingetorix , ubi de Caesaris adventu cognovit , oppuguatione destitit atque obviam Caesari proficiscitur . <end>$$Vercingetorix , when he ascertained the arrival of Caesar , desisted from the siege , and marched to meet Caesar .
<start> Ille oppidum Biturigum positum in via Noviodunum oppugnare instituerat Quo ex oppido cum legati ad eum venissent oratum ut sibi ignosceret suaeque vitae consuleret , ut celeritate reliquas res conficeret , qua pleraque erat consecutus , arma conferri , equos produci , obsides dari iubet . <end>$$The latter had commenced to besiege Noviodunum ; and when embassadors came from this town to beg that he would pardon them and spare their lives , in order that he might execute the rest of his designs with the rapidity by which he had accomplished most of them , he orders their arms to be collected , their horses to be brought forth , and hostages to be given .
<start> Parte iam obsidum tradita , cum reliqua administrarentur , centurionibus et paucis militibus intromissis , qui arma iumentaque conquirerent , equitatus hostium procul visus est , qui agmen Vercingetorigis antecesserat Quem simul atque oppidani conspexerunt atque in spem auxili venerunt , clamore sublato arma capere , portas claudere , murum complere coeperunt . <end>$$A part of the hostages being now delivered up , when the rest of the terms were being performed , a few centurions and soldiers being sent into the town to collect the arms and horses , the enemy's cavalry which had outstripped the main body of Vercingetorix's army , was seen at a distance ; as soon as the townsmen beheld them , and entertained hopes of assistance , raising a shout , they began to take up arms , shut the gates , and line the walls .
<start> Centuriones in oppido , cum ex significatione Gallorum novi aliquid ab eis iniri consili intellexissent , gladiis destrictis portas occupaverunt suosque omnes incolumes receperunt . <end>$$When the centurions in the town understood from the signal-making of the Gauls that they were forming some new design , they drew their swords and seized the gates , and recovered all their men safe .
<start> Caesar ex castris equitatum educi iubet , proelium equestre committit : laborantibus iam suis Germanos equites circiter CCCC summittit , quos ab initio habere secum instituerat . <end>$$Caesar orders the horse to be drawn out of the camp , and commences a cavalry action His men being now distressed , Caesar sends to their aid about four hundred German horse , which he had determined , at the beginning , to keep with himself .
<start> Eorum impetum Galli sustinere non potuerunt atque in fugam coniecti multis amissis se ad agmen receperunt . <end>$$The Gauls could not withstand their attack , but were put to flight , and retreated to their main body , after losing a great number of men .
<start> Quibus profligatis rursus oppidani perterriti comprehensos eos , quorum opera plebem concitatam existimabant , ad Caesarem perduxerunt seseque ei dediderunt . <end>$$When they were routed , the townsmen , again intimidated , arrested those persons by whose exertions they thought that the mob had been roused , and brought them to Caesar , and surrendered themselves to him .
<start> Quibus rebus confectis , Caesar ad oppidum Avaricum , quod erat maximum munitissimumque in finibus Biturigum atque agri fertilissima regione , profectus est , quod eo oppido recepto civitatem Biturigum se in potestatem redacturum confidebat . <end>$$When these affairs were accomplished , Caesar marched to the Avaricum , which was the largest and best fortified town in the territories of the Bituriges , and situated in a most fertile tract of country ; because he confidently expected that on taking that town , he would reduce beneath his dominion the state of the Bituriges .
<start> Vercingetorix tot continuis incommodis Vellaunoduni , Cenabi , Novioduni acceptis suos ad concilium convocat . <end>$$Vercingetorix , after sustaining such a series of losses at Vellaunodunum , Genabum , and Noviodunum , summons his men to a council .
<start> Docet longe alia ratione esse bellum gerendum atque antea gestum sit Omnibus modis huic rei studendum , ut pabulatione et commeatu Romani prohibeantur Id esse facile , quod equitatu ipsi abundent et quod anni tempore subleventur Pabulum secari non posse ; necessario dispersos hostes ex aedificiis petere : hos omnes cotidie ab equitibus deligi posse . <end>$$He impresses on them that the war must be prosecuted on a very different system from that which had been previously adopted ; but they should by all means aim at this object , that the Romans should be prevented from foraging and procuring provisions ; that this was easy , because they themselves were well supplied with cavalry , and were likewise assisted by the season of the year ; that forage could not be cut ; that the enemy must necessarily disperse , and look for it in the houses , that all these might be daily destroyed by the horse .
<start> Praeterea salutis causa rei familiaris commoda neglegenda : vicos atque aedificia incendi oportere hoc spatio ab via quoque versus , quo pabulandi causa adire posse videantur . <end>$$Besides that the interests of private property must be neglected for the sake of the general safety ; that the villages and houses ought to be fired , over such an extent of country in every direction from Boia , as the Romans appeared capable of scouring in their search for forage .
<start> Harum ipsis rerum copiam suppetere , quod , quorum in finibus bellum geratur , eorum opibus subleventur : Romanos aut inopiam non laturos aut magno periculo longius ab castris processuros ; neque interesse , ipsosne interficiant , impedimentisne exuant , quibus amissis bellum geri non possit . <end>$$That an abundance of these necessaries could be supplied to them , because they would be assisted by the resources of those in whose territories the war would be waged : that the Romans either would not bear the privation , or else would advance to any distance from the camp with considerable danger ; and that it made no difference whether they slew them or stripped them of their baggage , since , if it was lost , they could not carry on the war .
<start> Praeterea oppida incendi oportere , quae non munitione et loci natura ab omni sint periculo tuta , neu suis sint ad detractandam militiam receptacula neu Romanis proposita ad copiam commeatus praedamque tollendam . <end>$$Besides that , the towns ought to be burned which were not secured against every danger by their fortifications or natural advantages ; that there should not be places of retreat for their own countrymen for declining military service , nor be exposed to the Romans as inducements to carry off abundance of provisions and plunder .
<start> Haec si gravia aut acerba videautur , multo illa gravius aestimare , liberos , coniuges in servitutem abstrahi , ipsos interfici ; quae sit necesse accidere victis . <end>$$If these sacrifices should appear heavy or galling , that they ought to consider it much more distressing that their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery , and themselves slain ; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered .
<start> Omnium consensu hac sententia probata uno die amplius XX urbes Biturigum iucenduntur . <end>$$This opinion having been approved of by unanimous consent , more than twenty towns of the Bituriges are burned in one day .
<start> Hoc idem fit in reliquis civitatibus : in omnibus partibus incendia conspiciuntur ; quae etsi magno cum dolore omnes ferebant , tamen hoc sibi solati proponebant , quod se prope explorata victoria celeriter amissa reciperaturos confidebant . <end>$$Conflagrations are beheld in every quarter ; and although all bore this with great regret , yet they laid before themselves this consolation , that , as the victory was certain , they could quickly recover their losses .
<start> Deliberatur de Avarico in communi concilio , incendi placeret an defendi . <end>$$There is a debate concerning Avaricum in the general council , whether they should decide , that it should be burned or defended .
<start> Procumbunt omnibus Gallis ad pedes Bituriges , ne pulcherrimam prope totius Galliae urbem , quae praesidio et ornamento sit civitati , suis manibus succendere cogerentur : facile se loci natura defensuros dicunt , quod prope ex omnibus partibus flumine et palude circumdata unum habeat et perangustum aditum . <end>$$The Bituriges threw themselves at the feet of all the Gauls , and entreat that they should not be compelled to set fire with their own hands to the fairest city of almost the whole of Gaul , which was both a protection and ornament to the state ; they say that they could easily defend it , owing to the nature of the ground , for , being inclosed almost on every side by a river and a marsh , it had only one entrance , and that very narrow .
<start> Datur petentibus venia dissuadente primo Vercingetorige , post concedente et precibus ipsorum et misericordia vulgi . <end>$$Permission being granted to them at their earnest request , Vercingetorix at first dissuades them from it , but afterward concedes the point , owing to their entreaties and the compassion of the soldiers .
<start> Defensores oppido idonei deliguntur . <end>$$A proper garrison is selected for the town .
<start> Vercingetorix minoribus Caesarem itineribus subsequitur et locum castris deligit paludibus silvisque munitum ab Avarico longe milia passuum XVI . <end>$$Vercingetorix follows closely upon Caesar by shorter marches , and selects for his camp a place defended by woods and marshes , at the distance of fifteen miles from Avaricum .
<start> Ibi per certos exploratores in singula diei tempora quae ad Avaricum agerentur cognoscebat et quid fieri vellet imperabat Omnes nostras pabulationes frumentationesque observabat dispersosque , cum longius necessario procederent , adoriebatur magnoque incommodo adficiebat , etsi , quantum ratione provideri poterat , ab nostris occurrebatur , ut incertis temporibus diversisque itineribus iretur . <end>$$There he received intelligence by trusty scouts , every hour in the day , of what was going on at Avaricum , and ordered whatever he wished to be done ; he closely watched all our expeditions for corn and forage , and whenever they were compelled to go to a greater distance , he attacked them when dispersed , and inflicted severe loss upon them ; although the evil was remedied by our men , as far as precautions could be taken , by going forth at irregular times' and by different ways .
<start> Castris ad eam partem oppidi positis Caesar , quae intermissa flumine et a paludibus aditum , ut supra diximus , angustum habebat , aggerem apparare , vineas agere , turres duas constituere coepit : nam circumvallare loci natura prohibebat . <end>$$Caesar pitching his camp at that side of the town which was not defended by the river and marsh , and had a very narrow approach , as we have mentioned , began to raise the vineae and erect two towers : for the nature of the place prevented him from drawing a line of circumvallation .
<start> De re frumentaria Boios atque Aeduos adhortari non destitit ; quorum alteri , quod nullo studio agebant , non multum adiuvabant , alteri non magnis facultatibus , quod civitas erat exigua et infirma , celeriter quod habuerunt consumpserunt . <end>$$He never ceased to importune the Boii and Aedui for supplies of corn ; of whom the one , because they were acting with no zeal , did not aid him much ; the others , as their resources were not great , quickly consumed what they had .
<start> Summa difficultate rei frumentariae adfecto exercitu tenuitate Boiorum , indiligentia Aeduorum , incendiis aedificiorum , usque eo ut complures dies frumento milites caruerint et pecore ex longinquioribus vicis adacto extremam famem sustentarent , nulla tamen vox est ab eis audita populi Romani maiestate et superioribus victoriis indigna . <end>$$Although the army was distressed by the greatest want of corn , through the poverty of the Boii , the apathy of the Aedui , and the burning of the houses , to such a degree , that for several days the soldiers were without corn , and satisfied their extreme hunger with cattle driven from the remote villages ; yet no language was heard from them unworthy of the majesty of the Roman people and their former victories .
<start> Quin etiam Caesar cum in opere singulas legiones appellaret et , si acerbius inopiam ferrent , se dimissurum oppugnationem diceret , universi ab eo , ne id faceret , petebant : sic se complures anuos illo imperante meruisse , ut nullam ignominiam acciperent , nusquam infecta re discederent : hoc se ignominiae laturos loco , si inceptam oppugnationem reliquissent : praestare omnes perferre acerbitates , quam non civibus Romanis , qui Cenabi perfidia Gallorum interissent , parentarent . <end>$$Moreover , when Caesar addressed the legions , one by one , when at work , and said that he would raise the siege , if they felt the scarcity too severely , they unanimously begged him not to do so ; that they had served for several years under his command in such a manner that they never submitted to insult , and never abandoned an enterprise without accomplishing it ; that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned the siege after commencing it ; that it was better to endure every hardship than to not avenge the names of the Roman citizens who perished at Genabum by the perfidy of the Gauls .
<start> Haec eadem centurionibus tribunisque militum mandabant , ut per eos ad Caesarem deferrentur . <end>$$They intrusted the same declarations to the centurions and military tribunes , that through them they might be communicated to Caesar .
<start> Cum iam muro turres appropinquassent , ex captivis Caesar cognovit Vercingetorigem consumpto pabulo castra movisse propius Avaricum atque ipsum cum equitatu expeditisque , qui inter equites proeliari consuessent , insidiarum causa eo profectum , quo nostros postero die pabulatum venturos arbitraretur . <end>$$When the towers had now approached the walls , Caesar ascertained from the captives that Vercingetorix after destroying the forage , had pitched his camp nearer Avaricum , and that he himself with the cavalry and light-armed infantry , who generally fought among the horse , had gone to lay an ambuscade in that quarter , to which he thought that our troops would come the next day to forage .
<start> Illi celeriter per exploratores adventu Caesaris cognito carros impedimentaque sua in artiores silvas abdiderunt , copias omnes in loco edito atque aperto instruxerunt . <end>$$On learning these facts , he set out from the camp secretly at midnight , and reached the camp of the enemy early in the morning .
<start> Collis erat leniter ab infimo acclivis Hunc ex omnibus fere partibus palus difficilis atque impedita cingebat non latior pedibus quinquaginta . <end>$$There was a hill of a gentle ascent from the bottom ; a dangerous and impassable marsh , not more than fifty feet broad , begirt it on almost every side .
<start> Hoc se colle interruptis pontibus Galli fiducia loci continebant generatimque distributi in civitates omnia vada ac saltus eius paludis obtinebant sic animo parati , ut , si eam paludem Romani perrumpere conarentur , haesitantes premerent ex loco superiore ; ut qui propinquitatem loci videret paratos prope aequo Marte ad dimicandum existimaret , qui iniqui tatem condicionis perspiceret inani simulatione sese ostentare cognosceret . <end>$$The Gauls , having broken down the bridges , posted themselves on this hill , in confidence of their position , and being drawn up in tribes according to their respective states , held all the fords and passages of that marsh with trusty guards , thus determined that if the Romans should attempt to force the marsh , they would overpower them from the higher ground while sticking in it , so that whoever saw the nearness of the position , would imagine that the two armies were prepared to fight on almost equal terms ; but whoever should view accurately the disadvantage of position , would discover that they were showing off an empty affectation of courage .
<start> Indignantes milites Gaesar , quod conspectum suum hostes perferre possent tantulo spatio interiecto , et signum proeli exposcentes edocet , quanto detrimento et quot virorum tortium morte necesse sit constare victoriam ; quos cum sic animo paratos videat , ut nullum pro sua laude periculum recusent , summae se iniquitatis condemnari debere , nisi eorum vitam sua salute habeat cariorem . <end>$$Caesar clearly points out to his soldiers , who were indignant that the enemy could bear the sight of them at the distance of so short a space , and were earnestly demanding the signal for action , with how great loss and the death of how many gallant men the victory would necessarily be purchased : and when he saw them so determined to decline no danger for his renown , that he ought to be considered guilty of the utmost injustice if he did not hold their life dearer than his personal safety .
<start> Sic milites consolatus eodem die reducit in castra reliquaque quae ad oppugnationem pertinebant oppidi administrare instituit . <end>$$Having thus consoled his soldiers , he leads them back on the same day to the camp , and determined to prepare the other things which were necessary for the siege of the town .
<start> Vereingetorix , cum ad suos redisset , proditionis insimulatus , quod castra propius Romanos movisset , quod cum omni equitatu discessisset , quod sine imperio tantas copias reliquisset , quod eius discessu Romani tanta opportunitate et celeritate venissent : non haec omnia fortuito aut sine consilio accidere potuisse ; regnum illum Galliae malle Caesaris concessu quam ipsorum habere beneficio--tali modo accusatus ad haec respondit : Quod castra movisset , factum inopia pabuli etiam ipsis hortantibus ; quod propius Romanos accessisset , persuasum loci opportunitate , qui se ipsum munitione defenderet : equitum vero operam neque in loco palustri desiderari debuisse et illic fuisse utilem , quo sint profecti . <end>$$Vercingetorix , when he had returned to his men , was accused of treason , in that he had moved his camp nearer the Romans , in that he had gone away with all the cavalry , in that he had left so great forces without a commander , in that , on his departure , the Romans had come at such a favorable season , and with such dispatch ; that all these circumstances could not have happened accidentally or without design ; that he preferred holding the sovereignty of Gaul by the grant of Caesar to acquiring it by their favor .
<start> Summam imperi se consulto nulli discedentem tradidisse , ne is multitudinis studio ad dimicandum impelleretur ; cui rei propter animi mollitiem studere omnes videret , quod diutius laborem ferre non possent Romani si casu intervenerint , fortunae , si alicuius indicio vocati , huic habendam gratiam , quod et paucitatem eorum ex loco superiore cognoscere et virtutem despicere potuerint , qui dimicare non ausi turpiter se in castra receperint . <end>$$Being accused in such a manner , he made the following reply to these charges : -That his moving his camp had been caused by want of forage , and had been done even by their advice ; that his approaching near the Romans had been a measure dictated by the favorable nature of the ground , which would defend him by its natural strength ; that the service of the cavalry could not have been requisite in marshy ground , and was useful in that place to which they had gone ; that he , on his departure , had given the supreme command to no one intentionally , lest he should be induced by the eagerness of the multitude to hazard an engagement , to which he perceived that all were inclined , owing to their want of energy , because they were unable to endure fatigue any longer .
<start> Imperium se ab Caesare per proditionem nullum desiderare , quod habere victoria posset , quae iam esset sibi atque omnibus Gallis explorata : quin etiam ipsis remittere , si sibi magis honorem tribuere , quam ab se salutem accipere videantur . <end>$$That , if the Romans in the mean time came up by chance , they should feel grateful to fortune ; if invited by the information of some one they should feel grateful to him , because they were enabled to see distinctly from the higher ground the smallness of the number of their enemy , and despise the courage of those who , not daring to fight , retreated disgracefully into their camp .
<start> Hi iam ante edocti quae interrogati pronuntiarent , milites se esse legionarios dicunt ; fame et inopia adductos clam ex castris exisse , si quid frumenti aut pecoris in agris reperire possent : simili omnem exercitum inopia premi , nec iam vires sufficere cuiusquam nec ferre operis laborem posse : itaque statuisse imperatorem , si nihil in oppugnatione oppidi profecissent , triduo exercitum deducere . <end>$$They being previously instructed in what answers they should make when examined , say , That they were legionary soldiers , that , urged by famine and want , they had recently gone forth from the camp , if they could find any corn or cattle in the fields ; that the whole army was distressed by a similar scarcity , nor had any one now sufficient strength , nor could bear the labor of the work ; and therefore that the general was determined , if he made no progress in the siege , to draw off his army in three days .
<start> Haec , inquit , a me , Vercingetorix , beneficia habetis , quem proditionis insimulatis ; cuius opera sine vestro sanguine tantum exercitum victorem fame consumptum videtis ; quem turpiter se ex fuga recipientem ne qua civitas suis finibus recipiat a me provisum est . <end>$$These benefits , says Vercingetorix , you receive from me , whom you accuse of treason-me , by whose exertions you see so powerful and victorious an army almost destroyed by famine , without shedding one drop of your blood ; and I have taken precautions that no state shall admit within its territories this army in its ignominious flight from this place .
<start> Conclamat omnis multitudo et suo more armis concrepat , quod facere in eo consuerunt cuius orationem approbant : summum esse Vercingetorigem ducem , nec de eius fide dubitandum , nec maiore ratione bellum administrari posse . <end>$$The whole multitude raise a shout and clash their arms , according to their custom , as they usually do in the case of him of whose speech they approve ; that Vercingetorix was a consummate general , and that they had no doubt of his honor ; that the war could not be conducted with greater prudence .
<start> Statuunt , ut X milia hominum delecta ex omnibus copiis in oppidum mittantur , nec solis Biturigibus communem salutem committendam censent , quod paene in eo , si id oppidum retinuissent , summam victoriae constare intellegebant . <end>$$They determine that ten thousand men should be picked out of the entire army and sent into the town , and decide that the general safety should not be intrusted to the Bituriges alone , because they were aware that the glory of the victory must rest with the Bituriges , if they made good the defense of the town .
<start> Singulari militum nostrorum virtuti consilia cuius que modi Gallorum occurrebant , ut est summae genus sollertiae atque ad omnia imitanda et efficienda , quae ab quoque traduntur , aptissimum Nam et laqueis falces avertebant , quas , cum destinaverant , tormentis introrsus reducebant , et aggerem cuniculis subtrahebant , eo scientius quod apud eos magnae sunt ferrariae atque omne genus cuniculorum notum atque usitatum est . <end>$$To the extraordinary valor of our soldiers , devices of every sort were opposed by the Gauls ; since they are a nation of consummate ingenuity , and most skillful in imitating and making those things which are imparted by any one ; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses , and when they had caught hold of them firmly , drew them on by means of engines , and undermined the mound the more skillfully on this account , because there are in their territories extensive iron mines , and consequently every description of mining operations is known and practiced by them .
<start> Totum autem murum ex omni parte turribus contabulaverant atque has coriis intexerant . <end>$$They had furnished , more over , the whole wall on every side with turrets , and had covered them with skins .
<start> Tum crebris diurnis nocturnisque eruptionibus aut aggeri ignem inferebant aut milites occupatos in opere adoriebantur , et nostrarum turrium altitudinem , quantum has cotidianus agger expresserat , commissis suarum turrium malis adaequabant , et apertos cuniculos praeusta et praeacuta materia et pice fervefacta et maximi ponderis saxis morabantur moenibusque appropinquare prohibebant . <end>$$Besides , in their frequent sallies by day and night , they attempted either to set fire to the mound , or attack our soldiers when engaged in the works ; and , moreover , by splicing the upright timbers of their own towers , they equaled the height of ours , as fast as the mound had daily raised them , and countermined our mines , and impeded the working of them by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends , and boiling pitch and stones of very great weight , and prevented them from approaching the walls .
<start> Muri autem omnes Gallici hac fere forma sunt . <end>$$But this is usually the form of all the Gallic walls .
<start> Trabes derectae perpetuae in longitudinem paribus iutervallis , distantes inter se binos pedes , in solo collocantur . <end>$$Straight beams , connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal intervals , are placed together on the ground ; these are mortised on the inside , and covered with plenty of earth .
<start> Hae revinciuntur introrsus et multo aggere vestiuntur : ea autem , quae diximus , inter valla grandibus in fronte saxis effarciuntur . <end>$$But the intervals which we have mentioned , are closed up in front by large stones .
<start> His collocatis et coagmentatis alius insuper ordo additur , ut idem illud intervallum servetur neque inter se contingaut trabes , sed paribus intermissae spatiis singulae singulis saxis interiectis arte contineantur . <end>$$These being thus laid and cemented together , another row is added above , in such a manner , that the same interval may be observed , and that the beams may not touch one another , but equal spaces intervening , each row of beams is kept firmly in its place by a row of stones .
<start> Sic deinceps omne opus contexitur , dum iusta muri altitudo expleatur . <end>$$In this manner the whole wall is consolidated , until the regular height of the wall be completed .
<start> Hoc cum in speciem varietatemque opus deforme non est alternis trabibus ac saxis , quae rectis lineis suos ordines servant , tum ad utilitatem et defensionem urbium summam habet opportunitatem , quod et ab incendio lapis et ab ariete materia defendit , quae perpetuis trabibus pedes quadragenos plerumque introrsus revincta neque perrumpi neque distrahi potest . <end>$$This work , with respect to appearance and variety , is not unsightly , owing to the alternate rows of beams and stones , which preserve their order in right lines ; and , besides , it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defense of cities ; for the stone protects it from fire , and the wood from the battering ram , since it being mortised in the inside with rows of beams , generally forty feet each in length , can neither be broken through nor torn asunder .
<start> His tot rebus impedita oppugnatione milites , cum toto tempore frigore et assiduis imbribus tardarentur , tamen continenti labore omnia haec superaverunt et diebus XXV aggerem latum pedes CCCXXX , altum pedes LXXX exstruxerunt . <end>$$The siege having been impeded by so many disadvantages , the soldiers , although they were retarded during the whole time by the mud , cold , and constant showers , yet by their incessant labor overcame all these obstacles , and in twenty-five days raised a mound three hundred and thirty feet broad and eighty feet high .
<start> Cum is murum hostium paene contingeret , et Caesar ad opus consuetudine excubaret milites que hortaretur , ne quod omnino tempus ab opere intermitteretur , paulo ante tertiam vigiliam est animadversum fumare aggerem , quem cuniculo hostes succenderant , eodemque tempore toto muro clamore sublato duabus portis ab utroque latere turrium eruptio fiebat , alii faces atque aridam materiem de muro in aggerem eminus iaciebant , picem reliquasque res , quibus ignis excitari potest , fundebant , ut quo primum curreretur aut cui rei ferretur auxilium vix ratio iniri posset . <end>$$Some at a distance were casting torches and dry wood from the wall on the mound , others were pouring on it pitch , and other materials , by which the flame might be excited , so that a plan could hardly be formed , as to where they should first run to the defense , or to what part aid should be brought .
<start> Cum in omnibus locis consumpta iam reliqua parte noctis pugnaretur , semperque hostibus spes victoriae redintegraretur , eo magis , quod deustos pluteos turrium videbant nec facile adire apertos ad auxiliandum animadvertebant , semperque ipsi recentes defessis succederent omnemque Galliae salutem in illo vestigio temporis positam arbitrarentur , accidit inspectantibus nobis quod dignum memoria visum praetereundum non existimavimus . <end>$$When the battle was going on in every direction , the rest of the night being now spent , and fresh hopes of victory always arose before the enemy : the more so on this account because they saw the coverings of our towers burnt away , and perceived , that we , being exposed , could not easily go to give assistance , and they themselves were always relieving the weary with fresh men , and considered that all the safety of Gaul rested on this crisis ; there happened in my own view a circumstance which , having appeared to be worthy of record , we thought it ought not to be omitted .
<start> Quidam ante portam oppidi Gallus per manus sebi ac picis traditas glebas in ignem e regione turris proiciebat : scorpione ab latere dextro traiectus exanimatusque concidit . <end>$$A certain Gaul before the gate of the town , who was casting into the fire opposite the turret balls of tallow and fire which were passed along to him , was pierced with a dart on the right side and fell dead .
<start> Hunc ex proximis unus iacentem transgressus eodem illo munere fungebatur ; eadem ratione ictu scorpionis exanimato alteri successit tertius et tertio quartus , nec prius ille est a propugnatoribus vacuus relictus locus quam restincto aggere atque omni ex parte summotis hostibus finis est pugnandi factus . <end>$$One of those next him stepped over him as he lay , and discharged the same office : when the second man was slain in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow , a third succeeded him , and a fourth succeeded the third : nor was this post left vacant by the besieged , until , the fire of the mound having been extinguished , and the enemy repulsed in every direction , an end was put to the fighting .
<start> Omnia experti Galli , quod res nulla successerat , postero die consilium ceperunt ex oppido profugere hortante et iubente Vercingetorige . <end>$$The Gauls having tried every expedient , as nothing had succeeded , adopted the design of fleeing from the town the next day , by the advice and order of Vercingetorix .
<start> Id silentio noctis conati non magna iactura suorum sese effecturos sperabant , propterea quod neque longe ab oppido castra Vercingetorigis aberant , et palus , quae perpetua intercedebat , Romanos ad insequendum tardabat . <end>$$They hoped that , by attempting it at the dead of night , they would effect it without any great loss of men , because the camp of Vercingetorix was not far distant from the town , and the extensive marsh which intervened , was likely to retard the Romans in the pursuit .
<start> Iamque hoc facere noctu apparabant , cum matres familiae repente in publicum procurrerunt flentesque proiectae ad pedes suorum omnibus precibus petierunt , ne se et communes liberos hostibus ad supplicium dederent , quos ad capiendam fugam naturae et virium infirmitas impediret . <end>$$And they were now preparing to execute this by night , when the matrons suddenly ran out-into the streets , and weeping cast themselves at the feet of their husbands , and requested of them , with every entreaty , that they should not abandon themselves and their common children to the enemy for punishment , because the weakness of their nature and physical powers prevented them from taking to flight .
<start> Vbi eos in sententia perstare viderunt , quod plerumque in summo periculo timor misericordiam non recipit , conclamare et significare de fuga Romanis coeperunt . <end>$$When they saw that they persisted in their resolution , they began to shout aloud , and give intelligence of their flight to the Romans .
<start> Quo timore perterriti Galli , ne ab equitatu Romanorum viae praeoccuparentur , consilio destiterunt . <end>$$The Gauls being intimidated by fear of this , lest the passes should be pre-occupied by the Roman cavalry , desisted from their design .
<start> Postero die Caesar promota turri perfectisque operibus quae facere instituerat , magno coorto imbre non inutilem hanc ad capiendum consilium tempestatem arbitratus est , quod paulo incautius custodias in muro dispositas videbat , suosque languidius in opere versari iussit et quid fieri vellet ostendit . <end>$$The next day Caesar , the tower being advanced , and the works which he had determined to raise being arranged , a violent storm arising , thought this no bad time for executing his designs , because he observed the guards arranged on the walls a little too negligently , and therefore ordered his own men to engage in their work more remissly , and pointed out what he wished to be done .
<start> Legionibusque intra vineas in occulto expeditis , cohortatus ut aliquando pro tantis laboribus fructum victoriae perciperent , eis qui primi murum ascendissent praemia proposuit militibusque signum dedit . <end>$$He proposed a reward for those who should first scale the walls , and gave the signal to the soldiers .
<start> Hostes re nova perterriti muro turribusque deiecti in foro ac locis patentioribus cuneatim constiterunt , hoc animo ut si qua ex parte obviam contra veniretur acie instructa depugnarent . <end>$$The enemy being alarmed by the suddenness of the attack , were dislodged from the wall and towers , and drew up , in form of a wedge , in the market place and the open streets , with this intention that , if an attack should be made on any side , they should fight with their line drawn up to receive it .
<start> Vbi neminem in aequum loeum sese demittere , sed toto undique muro circum fundi viderunt , veriti ne omnino spes fugae tolleretur , abiectis armis ultimas oppidi partes continenti impetu petiverunt , parsque ibi , cum angusto exitu portarum se ipsi premerent , a militibus , pars iam egressa portis ab equitibus est interfecta ; nec fuit quisquam , qui praedae studeret . <end>$$When they saw no one descending to the level ground , and the enemy extending themselves along the entire wall in every direction , fearing lest every hope of flight should be cut off , they cast away their arms , and sought , without stopping , the most remote parts of the town .
<start> Denique ex omni numero , qui fuit circiter milium XL , vix DCCC , qui primo clamore audito se ex oppido eiecerunt , incolumes ad Vercingetorigem pervenerunt . <end>$$Thus , being excited by the massacre at Genabum and the fatigue of the siege , they spared neither those worn out with years , women , or children .
<start> Quos ille multa iam nocte silentio ex fuga excepit , veritus ne qua in castris ex eorum concursu et misericordia vulgi seditio oreretur , ut procul in via dispositis familiaribus suis principibusque civitatum disparandos deducendosque ad suos curaret , quae cuique civitati pars eastrorum ab initio obvenerat . <end>$$Finally , out of all that number , which amounted to about forty thousand , scarcely eight hundred , who fled from the town when they heard the first alarm , reached Vercingetorix in safety : and he , the night being now far spent , received them in silence after their flight , so that , having arranged his friends and the chiefs of the states at a distance on the road , he took precautions that they should be separated and conducted to their fellow countrymen , to whatever part of the camp had been assigned to each state from the beginning .
<start> Fuit haec oratio non ingrata Gallis , et maxime , quod ipse animo non defecerat tanto accepto incommodo neque se in occultum abdiderat et conspectum multitudinis fugerat ; plusque animo providere et praesentire existimabatur , quod re integra primo incendendum Avaricum , post deserendum censuerat . <end>$$This speech was not disagreeable to the Gauls , principally , because he himself was not disheartened by receiving so severe a loss , and had not concealed himself , nor shunned the eyes of the people : and he was believed to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than the rest , because , when the affair was undecided , he had at first been of opinion that Avaricum should be burnt , and afterward that it should be abandoned .
<start> Itaque ut reliquorum imperatorum res adversae auctoritatem minuunt , sic huius ex contrario dignitas incommodo accepto in dies augebatur Simul in spem veniebant eius adfirmatione de reliquis adiungendis civitatibus ; primumque eo tempore Galli castra munire instituerunt et sic sunt animo confirmati , homines insueti laboris , ut omnia quae imperarentur sibi patienda existimarent . <end>$$Accordingly , as ill success weakens the authority of other generals , so , on the contrary , his dignity increased daily , although a loss was sustained : at the same time they began to entertain hopes , on his assertion , of uniting the rest of the states to themselves , and on this occasion , for the first time , the Gauls began to fortify their camps , and were so alarmed that although they were men unaccustomed to toil , yet they were of opinion that they ought to endure and suffer every thing which should be imposed upon them .
<start> Nec minus quam est pollicitus Vercingetorix animo laborabat ut reliquas civitates adiungeret , atque eas donis pollicitationibusque alliciebat . <end>$$Nor did Vercingetorix use less efforts than he had promised , to gain over the other states , and endeavored to entice their leaders by gifts and promises .
<start> Huic rei idoneos homines deligebat , quorum quisque aut oratione sub dola aut amicitia facillime capere posset . <end>$$For this object he selected fitting emissaries , by whose subtle pleading or private friendship , each of the nobles could be most easily influenced .
<start> Qui Avarico expugnato refugerant , armandos vestiendosque curat ; simul , ut deminutae copiae redintegrarentur , imperat certum numerum militum civitatibus , quem et quam ante diem in castra adduci velit , sagittariosque omnes , quorum erat permagnus numerus in Gallia , conquiri et ad se mitti iubet . <end>$$He takes care that those who fled to him on the storming of Avaricum should be provided with arms and clothes At the same time that his diminished forces should be recruited , he levies a fixed quota of soldiers from each state , and defines the number and day before which he should wish them brought to the camp , and orders all the archers , of whom there was a very great number in Gaul , to be collected and sent to him .
<start> His rebus celeriter id quod Avarici deperierat expletur . <end>$$By these means , the troops which were lost at Avaricum are speedily replaced .
<start> Interim Teutomatus , Olloviconis filius , rex Nitiobrigum , cuius pater ab senatu nostro amicus erat appellatus , cum magno equitum suorum numero et quos ex Aquitania conduxerat ad eum pervenit . <end>$$In the mean time , Teutomarus , the son of Ollovicon , the king of the Nitiobriges , whose father had received the appellation of friend from our senate , came to him with a great number of his own horse and those whom he had hired from Aquitania .
<start> Caesar Avarici complures dies commoratus summamque ibi copiam frumenti et reliqui commeatus nactus exercitum ex labore atque inopia refecit . <end>$$Caesar , after delaying several days at Avaricum , and , finding there the greatest plenty of corn and other provisions , refreshed his army after their fatigue and privation .
<start> Iam prope hieme confecta cum ipso anni tempore ad gerendum bellum vocaretur et ad hostem proficisci constituisset , sive eum ex paludibus silvisque elicere sive obsidione premere posset , legati ad eum principes Aeduorum veniunt oratum ut maxime necessario tempore civitati subveniat : Summo esse in periculo rem , quod , cum singuli magistratus antiquitus creari atque regiam potestatem annum obtinere consuessent , duo magistratum gerant et se uterque eorum legibus creatum esse dicat . <end>$$The winter being almost ended , when he was invited by the favorable season of the year to prosecute the war and march against the enemy , whether he could draw them from the marshes and woods , or else press them by a blockade ; some noblemen of the Aedui came to him as embassadors to entreat that in an extreme emergency he should succor their state ; that their affairs were in the utmost danger , because , whereas single magistrates had been usually appointed in ancient times and held the power of king for a single year , two persons now exercised this office , and each asserted that he was appointed according to their laws .
<start> Horum esse alterum Convictolitavem , florentem et illustrem adulescentem , alterum Cotum , antiquissima familia natum atque ipsum hominem summae potentiae et magnae cognationis , cuius frater Valetiacus proximo anno eundem magistratum gesserit . <end>$$That one of them was Convictolitanis , a powerful and illustrious youth ; the other Cotus , sprung from a most ancient family , and personally a man of very great influence and extensive connections .
<start> Civitatem esse omnem in armis ; divisum senatum , divisum populum , suas cuiusque eorum clientelas Quod si diutius alatur controversia , fore uti pars cum parte civitatis confligat Id ne accidat , positum in eius diligentia atque auctoritate . <end>$$His brother Valetiacus had borne the same office during the last year : that the whole state was up in arms ; the senate divided , the people divided ; that each of them had his own adherents ; and that , if the animosity would be fomented any longer , the result would be that one part of the state would come to a collision with the other ; that it rested with his activity and influence to prevent it .
<start> Caesar , etsi a bello atque hoste discedere detrimentosum esse existimabat , tamen non ignorans quanta ex dissensionibus incommoda oriri consuessent , ne tanta et tam coniuncta populo Romano civitas , quam ipse semper aluisset omnibusque rebus ornasset , ad vim atque arma descenderet , atque ea pars quae minus sibi confideret auxilia a Vercingetorige arcesseret , huic rei praevertendum existimavit et , quod legibus Aeduorum eis , qui summum magistra tum obtinerent , excedere ex finibus non liceret , ne quid de iure aut de legibus eorum deminuisse videretur , ipse in Aeduos proficisci statuit senatumque omnem et quos inter controversia esset ad se Decetiam evocavit . <end>$$Although Caesar considered it ruinous to leave the war and the enemy , yet , being well aware what great evils generally arise from internal dissensions , lest a state so powerful and so closely connected with the Roman people , which he himself had always fostered and honored in every respect , should have recourse to violence and arms , and that the party which had less confidence in its own power should summon aid from Vercingetorix , he determined to anticipate this movement ; and because , by the laws of the Aedui , it was not permitted those who held the supreme authority to leave the country , he determined to go in person to the Aedui , lest he should appear to infringe upon their government and laws , and summoned all the senate , and those between whom the dispute was , to meet him at Decetia .
<start> Cum prope omnis civitas eo convenisset , docereturque paucis clam convocatis alio loco , alio tempore atque oportuerit fratrem a fratre renuntiatum , cum leges duo ex una familia vivo utroque non solum magistratus creari vetarent , sed etiam in senatu esse prohiberent , Cotum imperium deponere coegit , Convictolitavem , qui per sacerdotes more civitatis intermissis magistratibus esset creatus , potestatem obtinere iussit . <end>$$When almost all the state had assembled there , and he was informed that one brother had been declared magistrate by the other , when only a few persons were privately summoned for the purpose , at a different time and place from what he ought , whereas the laws not only forbade two belonging to one family to be elected magistrates while each was alive , but even deterred them from being in the senate , he compelled Cotus to resign his office ; he ordered Convictolitanis , who had been elected by the priests , according to the usage of the state , in the presence of the magistrates , to hold the supreme authority .
<start> Hoc decreto interposito cohortatus Aeduos , ut controversiarum ac dissensionis obliviscerentur atque omnibus omissis his rebus huic bello servirent eaque quae meruissent praemia ab se devicta Gallia exspectarent equitatumque omnem et peditum milia decem sibi celeriter mitterent , quae in praesidiis rei frumentariae causa disponeret , exercitum in duas partes divisit : quattuor legiones in Senones Parisiosque Labieno ducendas dedit , sex ipse in Arvernos ad oppidum Gergoviam secundum flumen Elaver duxit ; equitatus partem illi attribuit , partem sibi reliquit . <end>$$Having pronounced this decree between , he exhorted the Aedui to bury in oblivion their disputes and dissensions , and , laying aside all these things , devote themselves to the war , and expect from him , on the conquest of Gaul , those rewards which they should have earned , and send speedily to him all their cavalry and ten thousand infantry , which he might place in different garrisons to protect his convoys of provisions , and then divided his army into two parts : he gave Labienus four legions to lead into the country of the Senones and Parisii ; and led in person six into the country of the Arverni , in the direction of the town of Gergovia , along the banks of the Allier .
<start> Cum uterque utrimque exisset exercitus , in conspectu fereque e regione castris castra ponebant dispositis exploratoribus , necubi effecto ponte Romani copias traducerent Erat in magnis Caesaris difficultatibus res , ne maiorem aestatis partem flumine impediretur , quod non fere ante autumnum Elaver vado transiri solet . <end>$$When each army was in sight of the other , and was pitching their camp almost opposite that of the enemy , scouts being distributed in every quarter , lest the Romans should build a bridge and bring over their troops ; it was to Caesar a matter attended with great difficulties , lest he should be hindered from passing the river during the greater part of the summer , as the Allier can not generally be forded before the autumn .
<start> Itaque , ne id accideret , silvestri loco castris positis e regione unius eorum pontium , quos Vercingetorix rescindendos curaverat , postero die cum duabus legionibus in occulto restitit ; reliquas copias cum omnibus impedimentis , ut consueverat , misit , apertis quibusdam cohortibus , uti numerus legionum constare videretur . <end>$$Therefore , that this might not happen , having pitched his camp in a woody place opposite to one of those bridges which Vercingetorix had taken care should be broken down , the next day he stopped behind with two legions in a secret place ; he sent on the rest of the forces as usual , with all the baggage , after having selected some cohorts , that the number of the legions might appear to be complete .
<start> His quam longissime possent egredi iussis , eum iam ex diei tempore coniecturam ceperat in castra perventum , isdem sublicis , quarum pars inferior integra remanebat , pontem reficere coepit . <end>$$Having ordered these to advance as far as they could , when now , from the time of day , he conjectured they had come to an encampment , he began to rebuild the bridge on the same piles , the lower part of which remained entire .
<start> Celeriter effecto opere legionibusque traductis et loco castris idoneo delecto reliquas copias revocavit . <end>$$Having quickly finished the work and led his legions across , he selected a fit place for a camp , and recalled the rest of his troops .
<start> Vercingetorix re cognita , ne contra suam voluntatem dimicare cogeretur , magnis itineribus antecessit . <end>$$Vercingetorix , on ascertaining this fact , went before him by forced marches , in order that he might not be compelled to come to an action against his will .
<start> Caesar ex eo loco quintis castris Gergoviam pervenit equestrique eo die proelio levi facto perspecto urbis situ , quae posita in altissimo monte omnes aditus difficiles habebat , de expugnatione desperavit , de obsessione non prius agendum constituit , quam rem frumentariam expedisset . <end>$$Caesar , in five days' march , went from that place to Gergovia , and after engaging in a slight cavalry skirmish that day , on viewing the situation of the city , which , being built on a very high mountain , was very difficult of access , he despaired of taking it by storm , and determined to take no measures with regard to besieging it before he should secure a supply of provisions .
<start> At Vercingetorix castris , prope oppidum positis , mediocribus circum se intervallis separatim singularum civitatium copias collocaverat atque omnibus eius iugi collibus occupatis , qua despici poterat , horribilem speciem praebebat ; principesque earum civitatium , quos sibi ad consilium capiendum delegerat , prima luce cotidie ad se convenire iubebat , seu quid communicandum , seu quid administrandum videretur ; neque ullum fere diem intermittebat quin equestri proelio interiectis sagittariis , quid in quoque esset animi ac virtutis suorum perspiceret . <end>$$But Vercingetorix , having pitched his camp on the mountain near the town , placed the forces of each state separately and at small intervals around himself , and having occupied all the hills of that range as far as they commanded a view , he presented a formidable appearance ; he ordered the rulers of the states , whom he had selected as his council of war , to come to him daily at the dawn , whether any measure seemed to require deliberation or execution .
<start> Erat e regione oppidi collis sub ipsis radicibus montis , egregie munitus atque ex omni parte circumcisus ; quem si tenerent nostri , et aquae magna parte et pabulatione libera prohibituri hostes videbantur . <end>$$Nor did he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a cavalry action , the archers being intermixed , what spirit and valor there was in each of his own men .
<start> Sed is locus praesidio ab his non nimis firmo tenebatur Tamen silentio noctis Caesar ex castris egressus , priusquam subsidio ex oppido veniri posset , deiecto praesidio potitus loco duas ibi legiones collocavit fossamque duplicem duodenum pedum a maioribus castris ad minora perduxit , ut tuto ab repentino hostium incursu etiam singuli commeare possent . <end>$$There was a hill opposite the town , at the very foot of that mountain , strongly fortified and precipitous on every side : however , Caesar set out from the camp in the silence of night , and dislodging the garrison before succor could come from the town , he got possession of the place and posted two legions there , and drew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet broad , so that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any sudden attack of the enemy .
<start> Dum haec ad Gergoviam geruntur , Convictolitavis Aeduus , cui magistratum adiudicatum a Caesare demonstravimus , sollicitatus ab Arvernis pecunia cum quibusdam adulescentibus colloquitur ; quorum erat princeps Litaviccus atque eius fratres , amplissima familia nati adulescentes . <end>$$While these affairs were going on at Gergovia , Convictolanis , the Aeduan , to whom we have observed the magistracy was adjudged by Caesar , being bribed by the Arverni , holds a conference with certain young men , the chief of whom were Litavicus and his brothers , who were born of a most noble family .
<start> Cum his praemium communicat hortaturque , ut se liberos et imperio natos meminerint Vnam esse Aeduorum civitatem , quae certissimam Galliae victoriam detineat ; eius auctoritate reliquas contineri ; qua traducta locum consistendi Romanis in Gallia non fore Esse nonnullo se Caesaris beneficio adfectum , sic tamen , ut iustissimam apud eum causam obtinuerit ; sed plus communi libertati tribuere Cur enim potius Aedui de suo iure et de legibus ad Caesarem disceptatorem , quam Romani ad Aeduos veniant ? Celeriter adulescentibus et oratione magistratus et praemio deductis , cum se vel priucipes eius consili fore profiterentur , ratio perficiendi quaerebatur , quod civitatem temere ad suscipiendum bellum adduci posse non confidebant . <end>$$He shares the bribe with them , and exhorts them to remember that they were free and born for empire ; that the state of the Aedui was the only one which retarded the most certain victory of the Gauls ; that the rest were held in check by its authority ; and , if it was brought over , the Romans would not have room to stand on in Gaul ; that he had received some kindness from Caesar , only so far , however , as gaining a most just cause by his decision ; but that he assigned more weight to the general freedom ; for , why should the Aedui go to Caesar to decide concerning their rights and laws , rather than the Romans come to the Aedui ? The young men being easily won over by the speech of the magistrate and the bribe , when they declared that they would even be leaders in the plot , a plan for accomplishing it was considered , because they were confident their state could not be induced to undertake the war on slight grounds .
<start> Placuit ut Litaviccus decem illis milibus , quae Caesari ad bellum mitterentur , praeficeretur atque ea ducenda curaret , fratresque eius ad Caesarem praecurrerent . <end>$$It was resolved that Litavicus should have the command of the ten thousand , which were being sent to Caesar for the war , and should have charge of them on their march , and that his brothers should go before him to Caesar .
<start> Reliqua qua ratione agi placeat constituunt . <end>$$They arrange the other measures , and the manner in which they should have them done .
<start> Litaviccus accepto exercitu , cum milia passuum circiter XXX ab Gergovia abesset , convocatis subito militibus lacrimans , Quo proficiscimur , inquit , milites ? Omnis noster equitatus , omnis nobilitas interiit ; principes civitatis , Eporedorix et Viridomarus , insimulati proditionis ab Romanis indicta causa interfecti sunt . <end>$$Litavicus , having received the command of the army , suddenly convened the soldiers , when he was about thirty miles distant from Gergovia , and , weeping , said , Soldiers , whither are we going ? All our knights and all our nobles have perished .
<start> Haec ab ipsis cognoscite , qui ex ipsa caede fugerunt : nam ego fratribus atque omnibus meis propinquis interfectis dolore prohibeor , quae gesta sunt , pronuntiare . <end>$$Eporedirix and Viridomarus , the principal men of the state , being accused of treason , have been slain by the Romans without any permission to plead their cause .
<start> Producuntur hi quos ille edocuerat quae dici vellet , atque eadem , quae Litaviccus pronuntiaverat , multitudini exponunt : multos equites Aeduorum interfectos , quod collocuti cum Arvernis dicerentur ; ipsos se inter multitudinem militum occultasse atque ex media caede fugisse . <end>$$Learn this intelligence from those who have escaped from the massacre ; for I , since my brothers and all my relations have been slain , am prevented by grief from declaring what has taken place .
<start> Quasi vero , inquit ille , consili sit res , ac non necesse sit nobis Gergoviam contendere et cum Arvernis nosmet coniungere . <end>$$As if , said he , it were a matter of deliberation , and not of necessity , for us to go to Gergovia and unite ourselves to the Arverni .
<start> An dubitamus quin nefario facinore admisso Romani iam ad nos interficiendos concurrant ? Proinde , si quid in nobis animi est , persequamur eorum mortem qui indignissime interierunt , atque hos latrones interficiamus . <end>$$Or have we any reasons to doubt that the Romans , after perpetrating the atrocious crime , are now hastening to slay us ? Therefore , if there be any spirit in us , let us avenge the death of those who have perished in a most unworthy manner , and let us slay these robbers .
<start> Ostendit cives Romanos , qui eius praesidi fiducia una erant : magnum numerum frumenti commeatusque diripit , ipsos crudeliter excruciatos interficit . <end>$$He points to the Roman citizens , who had accompanied them , in reliance on his protection .
<start> Eporedorix Aeduus , summo loco natus adulescens et summae domi potentiae , et una Viridomarus , pari aetate et gratia , sed genere dispari , quem Caesar ab Diviciaeo sibi traditum ex humili loco ad summam dignitatem perduxerat , in equitum numero convenerant nominatim ab eo evocati . <end>$$Eporedirix , the Aeduan , a young man born in the highest rank and possessing very great influence at home , and , along with Viridomarus , of equal age and influence , but of inferior birth , whom Caesar had raised from a humble position to the highest rank , on being recommended to him by Divitiacus , had come in the number of horse , being summoned by Caesar by name .
<start> His erat inter se de principatu contentio , et in illa magistratuum controversia alter pro Convictolitavi , alter pro Coto summis opibus pugnaverant . <end>$$These had a dispute with each other for precedence , and in the struggle between the magistrates they had contended with their utmost efforts , the one for Convictolitanis , the other for Cotus .
<start> Ex eis Eporedorix cognito Litavicci consilio media fere noete rem ad Caesarem defert ; orat ne patiatur civitatem pravis adulescentium consiliis ab amicitia populi Romani deficere ; quod futurum provideat , si se tot hominum milia cum hostibus coniunxerint , quorum salutem neque propinqui neglegere , neque civitas levi momento aestimare posset . <end>$$Of these Eporedirix , on learning the design of Litavicus , lays the matter before Caesar almost at midnight ; he entreats that Caesar should not suffer their state to swerve from the alliance with the Roman people , owing to the depraved counsels of a few young men which he foresaw would be the consequence if so many thousand men should unite themselves to the enemy , as their relations could not neglect their safety , nor the state regard it as a matter of slight importance .
<start> Magna adfectus sollicitudine hoc nuntio Caesar , quod semper Aeduorum civitati praecipue indulserat , nulla interposita dubitatione legiones expeditas quattuor equitatumque omnem ex castris educit ; nec fuit spatium tali tempore ad contrahenda castra , quod res posita in celeritate videbatur ; Gaium Fabium legatum eum legionibus duabus castris praesidio relinquit . <end>$$Caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence , because he had always especially indulged the state of the Aedui , and , without any hesitation , draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all the cavalry : nor had he time , at such a crisis , to contract the camp , because the affair seemed to depend upon dispatch .
<start> Fratres Litavicci eum comprehendi iussisset , paulo ante reperit ad hostes fugisse . <end>$$He leaves Caius Fabius , his lieutenant , with two legions to guard the camp .
<start> Adhortatus milites , ne necessario tempore itineris labore per moveantur , cupidissimis omnibus progressus milia passuum XXV agmen Aeduorum conspicatus immisso equitatu iter eorum moratur atque impedit interdicitque omnibus ne quemquam interficiant . <end>$$When he ordered the brothers of Litavicus to be arrested , he discovers that they had fled a short time before to the camp of the enemy .
<start> His cognitis et Litavicci fraude perspecta Aedui manus tendere , deditionem significare et proiectis armis mortem deprecari incipiunt . <end>$$When they were recognized and the treachery of Litavicus discovered , the Aedui began to extend their hands to intimate submission , and , laying down their arms , to deprecate death .
<start> Litaviccus cum suis clientibus , quibus more Gallorum nefas est etiam in extrema fortuna deserere patronos , Gergoviam profugit . <end>$$Litavicus , with his clansmen , who after the custom of the Gauls consider it a crime to desert their patrons , even in extreme misfortune , flees forth to Gergovia .
<start> Caesar nuntiis ad civitatem Aeduorum missis , qui suo beneficio conservatos docerent quos iure belli interficere potuisset , tribusque horis noctis exercitui ad quietem datis castra ad Gergoviam movit . <end>$$Caesar , after sending messengers to the state of the Aedui , to inform them that they whom he could have put to death by the right of war were spared through his kindness , and after giving three hours of the night to his army for his repose , directed his march to Gergovia .
<start> Dum haec ad Gergoviam geruntur , Aedui primis nuntiis ab Litavicco acceptis nullum sibi ad cognoscendum spatium relinquunt . <end>$$While these things are going on at Gergovia , the Aedui , on receiving the first announcements from Litavicus , leave themselves no time to ascertain the truth of those statements .
<start> Impellit alios avaritia , alios iracundia et temeritas , quae maxime illi hominum generi est innata , ut levem auditionem habeant pro re comperta . <end>$$Some are stimulated by avarice , others by revenge and credulity , which is an innate propensity in that race of men to such a degree that they consider a slight rumor as an ascertained fact .
<start> Bona civium Romanorum diripiunt , caedes faciunt , in servitutem abstrahunt . <end>$$They plunder the property of the Roman citizens , and either massacre them or drag them away to slavery .
<start> Adiuvat rem proclinatam Convictolitavis plebemque ad furorem impellit , ut facinore admisso ad sanitatem reverti pudeat . <end>$$Convictolitanis increases the evil state of affairs , and goads on the people to fury , that by the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return to propriety .
<start> Marcum Aristium , tribunum militum , iter ad legionem facientem fide data ex oppido Cabillono educunt : idem facere cogunt eos , qui negotiandi causa ibi constiterant . <end>$$They entice from the town of Cabillonus , by a promise of safety , Marcus Aristius , a military tribune , who was on his march to his legion ; they compel those who had settled there for the purpose of trading to do the same .
<start> Hos continuo itinere adorti omnibus impedimentis exuunt ; repugnantes diem noctemque obsident ; multis utrimque interfectis maiorem multitudinem armatorum concitant . <end>$$By constantly attacking them on their march they strip them of all their baggage ; they besiege day and night those that resisted ; when many were slain on both sides , they excite a great number to arms .
<start> Interim nuntio allato omnes eorum milites in potestate Caesaris teneri , concurrunt ad Aristium , nihil publico factum consilio demonstrant ; quaestionem de bonis direptis decernunt , Litavicci fatrumque bona publicant , legatos ad Caesarem sui purgandi gratia mittunt . <end>$$In the mean time , when intelligence was brought that all their soldiers were in Caesar's power , they run in a body to Aristius ; they assure him that nothing had been done by public authority ; they order an inquiry to be made about the plundered property ; they confiscate the property of Litavicus and his brothers ; they send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of clearing themselves .
<start> Haec faciunt reciperandorum suorum causa ; sed contaminati facinore et capti compendio ex direptis bonis , quod ea res ad multos pertinebat , timore poenae exterriti consilia clam de bello inire incipiunt civitatesque reliquas legationibus sollicitant . <end>$$They do all this with a view to recover their soldiers ; but being contaminated by guilt , and charmed by the gains arising from the plundered property , as that act was shared in by many , and being tempted by the fear of punishment , they began to form plans of war and stir up the other states by embassies .
<start> Quae tametsi Caesar intellegebat , tamen quam mitissime potest legatos appellat : nihil se propter inscientiam levitatemque vulgi gravius de civitate iudicare neque de sua in Aeduos benevolentia deminuere . <end>$$Although Caesar was aware of this proceeding , yet he addresses the embassadors with as much mildness as he can : That he did not think worse of the state on account of the ignorance and fickleness of the mob , nor would diminish his regard for the Aedui .
<start> Ipse maiorem Galliae motum exspectans , ne ab omnibus civitatibus circumsisteretur , consilia inibat quemadmodum ab Gergovia discederet ac rursus omnem exercitum contraheret , ne profectio nata ab timore defectionis similis fugae videretur . <end>$$He himself , fearing a greater commotion in Gaul , in order to prevent his being surrounded by all the states , began to form plans as to the manner in which he should return from Gergovia and again concentrate his forces , lest a departure arising from the fear of a revolt should seem like a flight .
<start> Haec cogitanti accidere visa est facultas bene rei gerendae . <end>$$While he was considering these things an opportunity of acting successfully seemed to offer .
<start> Nam cum in minora castra operis perspiciendi causa venisset , animadvertit collem , qui ab hostibus tenebatur , nudatum hominibus , qui superioribus diebus vix prae multitudine cerni poterat . <end>$$For , when he had come into the smaller camp for the purpose of securing the works , he noticed that the hill in the possession of the enemy was stripped of men , although , on the former days , it could scarcely be seen on account of the numbers on it .
<start> Admiratus quaerit ex perfugis causam , quorum magnus ad eum cotidie numerus confluebat . <end>$$Being astonished , he inquires the reason of it from the deserters , a great number of whom flocked to him daily .
<start> Constabat inter omnes , quod iam ipse Caesar per exploratores cognoverat , dorsum esse eius iugi prope aequum , sed hunc silvestrem et angustum , qua esset aditus ad alteram partem oppidi ; huic loco vehementer illos timere nec iam aliter sentire , uno colle ab Romanis occupato , si alterum amisissent , quin paene circumvallati atque omni exitu et pabulatione interclusi viderentur : ad hunc muniendum omnes a Vercingetorige evocatos . <end>$$They all concurred in asserting , what Caesar himself had already ascertained by his scouts , that the back of that hill was almost level ; but likewise woody and narrow , by which there was a pass to the other side of the town ; that they had serious apprehensions for this place , and had no other idea , on the occupation of one hill by the Romans , than that , if they should lose the other , they would be almost surrounded , and cut off from all egress and foraging ; that they were all summoned by Vercingetorix to fortify this place .
<start> Hac re cognita Caesar mittit complures equitum turmas ; eis de media nocte imperat , ut paulo tumultuosius omnibus locis vagarentur . <end>$$Caesar , on being informed of this circumstance , sends several troops of horse to the place immediately after midnight ; he orders them to range in every quarter with more tumult than usual .
<start> Prima luce magnum numerum impedimentorum ex castris mulorumque produci deque his stramenta detrahi mulionesque cum cassidibus equitum specie ac simulatione collibus circumvehi iubet . <end>$$At dawn he orders a large quantity of baggage to be drawn out of the camp , and the muleteers with helmets , in the appearance and guise of horsemen , to ride round the hills .
<start> His paucos addit equites qui latius ostentationis causa vagarentur . <end>$$To these he adds a few cavalry , with instructions to range more widely to make a show .
<start> Longo circuitu easdem omnes iubet petere regiones Haec procul ex oppido videbantur , ut erat a Gergovia despectus in castra , neque tanto spatio certi quid esset explorari poterat . <end>$$He orders them all to seek the same quarter by a long circuit ; these proceedings were seen at a distance from the town , as Gergovia commanded a view of the camp , nor could the Gauls ascertain at so great a distance , what certainty there was in the maneuver .
<start> Legionem unam eodem iugo mittit et paulum progressam inferiore constituit loco silvisque occultat . <end>$$He sends one legion to the same hill , and after it had marched a little , stations it in the lower ground , and conceals it in the woods .
<start> Augetur Gallis suspicio , atque omnes illo ad munitionem copiae traducuntur . <end>$$The suspicion of the Gauls are increased , and all their forces are marched to that place to defend it .
<start> Vacua castra hostium Caesar conspicatus tectis insignibus suorum occultatisque signis militaribus raros milites , ne ex oppido animadverterentur , ex maioribus castris in minora traducit legatisque , quos singulis legionibus praefecerat , quid fieri velit ostendit : in primis monet ut contineant milites , ne studio pugnandi aut spe praedae longius progrediantur ; quid iniquitas loci habeat incommodi proponit : hoc una celeritate posse mutari ; occasionis esse rem , non proeli . <end>$$Caesar , having perceived the camp of the enemy deserted , covers the military insignia of his men , conceals the standards , and transfers his soldiers in small bodies from the greater to the less camp , and points out to the lieutenants whom he had placed in command over the respective legions , what he should wish to be done ; he particularly advises them to restrain their men from advancing too far , through their desire of fighting , or their hope of plunder , he sets before them what disadvantages the unfavorable nature of the ground carries with it ; that they could be assisted by dispatch alone : that success depended on a surprise , and not on a battle .
<start> His rebus expositis signum dat et ab dextra parte alio ascensu eodem tempore Aeduos mittit . <end>$$After stating these particulars , he gives the signal for action , and detaches the Aedui at the same time by another ascent on the right .
<start> Oppidi murus ab planitie atque initio ascensus recta regione , si nullus anfractus intercederet , MCC passus aberat : quidquid huc circuitus ad molliendum clivum accesserat , id spatium itineris augebat . <end>$$The town wall was 1200 paces distant from the plain and foot of the ascent , in a straight line , if no gap intervened ; whatever circuit was added to this ascent , to make the hill easy , increased the length of the route .
<start> A medio fere colle in longitudinem , ut natura montis ferebat , ex grandibus saxis sex pedum murum qui nostrorum impetum tardaret praeduxerant Galli , atque inferiore omni spatio vacuo relicto superiorem partem collis usque ad murum oppidi densissimis castris compleverant . <end>$$But almost in the middle of the hill , the Gauls had previously built a wall six feet high , made of large stones , and extending in length as far as the nature of the ground permitted , as a barrier to retard the advance of our men ; and leaving all the lower space empty , they had filled the upper part of the hill , as far as the wall of the town , with their camps very close to one another .
<start> Milites dato signo celeriter ad munitionem perveniunt eamque transgressi trinis castris potiuntur ; ac tanta fuit in castris capiendis celeritas , ut Teutomatus , rex Nitiobrigum , subito in tabernaculo oppressus , ut meridie conquieverat , superiore corporis parte nudata vulnerato equo vix se ex manibus praedantium militum eriperet . <end>$$The soldiers , on the signal being given , quickly advance to this fortification , and passing over it , make themselves masters of the separate camps And so great was their activity in taking the camps , that Teutomarus , the king of the Nitiobriges , being suddenly surprised in his tent , as he had gone to rest at noon , with difficulty escaped from the hands of the plunderers , with the upper part of his person naked , and his horse wounded .
<start> Consecutus id quod animo proposuerat , Caesar receptui cani iussit legionique decimae , quacum erat , continuo signa constituit . <end>$$Caesar , having accomplished the object which he had in view , ordered the signal to be sounded for a retreat ; and the soldiers of the tenth legion , by which he was then accompanied , halted .
<start> Sed elati spe celeris victoriae et hostium fuga et superiorum temporum secundis proeliis nihil adeo arduum sibi esse existimaverunt quod non virtute consequi possent , neque finem prius sequendi fecerunt quam muro oppidi portisque appropinquarunt . <end>$$The matrons begin to cast their clothes and silver over the wall , and bending over as far as the lower part of the bosom , with outstretched hands beseech the Romans to spare them , and not to sacrifice to their resentment even women and children , as they had done at Avaricum .
<start> Tum vero ex omnibus urbis partibus orto clamore , qui longius aberant repentino tumultu perterriti , cum hostem intra portas esse existimarent , sese ex oppido eiecerunt . <end>$$Some of them let themselves down from the walls by their hands , and surrendered to our soldiers .
<start> Matres familiae de muro vestem argentumque iactabant et pectore nudo prominentes passis manibus obtestabantur Romanos , ut sibi parcerent neu , sicut Avarici fecissent , ne a mulieribus quidem atque infantibus abstinerent : nonnullae de muris per manus demissae sese militibus tradebant . <end>$$Lucius Fabius a centurion of the eighth legion , who , it was ascertained , had said that day among his fellow soldiers that he was excited by the plunder of Avaricum , and would not allow any one to mount the wall before him , finding three men of his own company , and being raised up by them , scaled the wall .
<start> Interim ei qui ad alteram partem oppidi , ut supra demonstravimus , munitionis causa convenerant , primo exaudito clamore , inde etiam crebris nuntiis incitati , oppidum a Romanis teneri , praemissis equitibus magno concursu eo contenderunt . <end>$$In the mean time those who had gone to the other part of the town to defend it , as we have mentioned above , at first , aroused by hearing the shouts , and , afterward , by frequent accounts , that the town was in possession of the Romans , sent forward their cavalry , and hastened in larger numbers to that quarter .
<start> Eorum ut quisque primus venerat , sub muro consistebat suorumque pugnantium numerum augebat . <end>$$As each first came he stood beneath the wall , and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in action .
<start> Quorum cum magna multitudo convenisset , matres familiae , quae paulo ante Romanis de muro manus tendebant , suos obtestari et more Gallico passum capillum ostentare liberosque in conspectum proferre coeperunt . <end>$$When a great multitude of them had assembled , the matrons , who a little before were stretching their hands from the walls to the Romans , began to beseech their countrymen , and after the Gallic fashion to show their disheveled hair , and bring their children into public view .
<start> Erat Romanis nec loco nec numero aequa contentio ; simul et cursu et spatio pugnae defatigati non facile recentes atque integros sustinebant . <end>$$Neither in position nor in numbers was the contest an equal one to the Romans ; at the same time , being exhausted by running and the long continuation of the fight , they could not easily withstand fresh and vigorous troops .
<start> Caesar , cum iniquo loco pugnari hostiumque augeri copias videret , praemetuens suis ad Titum Sextium legatum , quem minoribus castris praesidio reliquerat , misit , ut cohortes ex castris celeriter educeret et sub infimo colle ab dextro latere hostium constitueret , ut , si nostros loco depulsos vidisset , quo minus libere hostes insequerentur terreret . <end>$$Caesar , when he perceived that his soldiers were fighting on unfavorable ground , and that the enemy's forces were increasing , being alarmed for the safety of his troops , sent orders to Titus Sextius , one of his lieutenants , whom he had left to guard the smaller camp , to lead out his cohorts quickly from the camp , and post them at the foot of the hill , on the right wing of the enemy ; that if he should see our men driven from the ground , he should deter the enemy from following too closely .
<start> Ipse paulum ex eo loco cum legione progressus , ubi constiterat , eventum pugnae exspectabat . <end>$$He himself , advancing with the legion a little from that place where he had taken his post , awaited the issue of the battle .
<start> Cum acerrime comminus pugnaretur , hostes loco et numero , nostri virtute confiderent , subito sunt Aedui nsi ab latere nostris aperto , quos Caesar ab dextra parte alio ascensu manus distinendae causa miserat . <end>$$While the fight was going on most vigorously , hand to hand , and the enemy depended on their position and numbers , our men on their bravery , the Aedui suddenly appeared on our exposed flank , as Caesar had sent them by another ascent on the right , for the sake of creating a diversion .
<start> Hi similitudine armorum vehementer nostros perterruerunt , ac tametsi dextris humeris ex sertis animadvertebantur , quod insigne pactum esse consuerat , tamen id ipsum sui fallendi causa milites ab hostibus factum existimabant . <end>$$These , from the similarity of their arms , greatly terrified our men ; and although they were discovered to have their right shoulders bare , which was usually the sign of those reduced to peace , yet the soldiers suspected that this very thing was done by the enemy to deceive them .
<start> Eodem tempore Lucius Fabius centurio quique una murum ascenderant circumventi atque interfecti muro praecipitabantur . <end>$$At the same time Lucius Fabius the centurion , and those who had scaled the wall with him , being surrounded and slain , were cast from the wall .
<start> Marcus Petronius , eiusdem legionis centurio , cum portam excidere conatus esset , a multitudine oppressus ac sibi desperans multis iam vulneribus acceptis manipularibus suis , qui illum secuti erant , Quoniam , inquit , me una vobiscum servare non possum , vestrae quidem certe vitae prospiciam , quos cupiditate gloriae adductus in periculum deduxi . <end>$$Marcus Petreius , a centurion of the same legion , after attempting to hew down the gates , was overpowered by numbers , and , despairing of his safety , having already received many wounds , said to the soldiers of his own company who followed him : Since I can not save you as well as myself , I shall at least provide for your safety , since I , allured by the love of glory , led you into this danger , do you save yourselves when an opportunity is given .
<start> Vos data facultate vobis consulite Simul in medios hostes irrupit duobusque interfectis reliquos a porta paulum summovit . <end>$$At the same time he rushed into the midst of the enemy , and slaying two of them , drove back the rest a little from the gate .
<start> Conantibus auxiliari suis Frustra , inquit , meae vitae subvenire conamini , quem iam sanguis viresque deficiunt Proinde abite , dum est facultas , vosque ad legionem recipite . <end>$$When his men attempted to aid him , In vain , he says , you endeavor to procure me safety , since blood and strength are now failing me , therefore leave this , while you have the opportunity , and retreat to the legion .
<start> Ita puguans post paulum concidit ac suis saluti fuit . <end>$$Thus he fell fighting a few moments after , and saved his men by his own death .
<start> Nostri , cum undique premerentur , XLVI centurionibus amissis deiecti sunt loco Sed intolerantius Gallos insequentes legio decima tardavit , quae pro subsidio paulo aequiore loco constiterat . <end>$$Our soldiers , being hard pressed on every side , were dislodged from their position , with the loss of forty-six centurions ; but the tenth legion , which had been posted in reserve on ground a little more level , checked the Gauls in their eager pursuit .
<start> Hanc rursus XIII legionis cohortes exceperunt , quae ex castris minoribus eductae cum Tito Sextio legato ceperant locum superiorem . <end>$$It was supported by the cohorts of the thirteenth legion , which , being led from the smaller camp , had , under the command of Titus Sextius , occupied the higher ground .
<start> Legiones , ubi primum planitiem attigerunt , infestis contra hostes signis constiterunt . <end>$$The legions , as soon as they reached the plain , halted and faced the enemy .
<start> Vercingetorix ab radicibus collis suos intra munitiones reduxit . <end>$$Vercingetorix led back his men from the part of the hill within the fortifications .
<start> Eo die milites sunt paulo minus septingenti desiderati . <end>$$On that day little less than seven hundred of the soldiers were missing .
<start> Postero die Caesar contione advocata temeritatem cupiditatemque militum reprehendit , quod sibi ipsi iudicavissent quo procedendum aut quid agendum videretur , neque signo recipiendi dato constitissent neque ab tribunis militum legatisque retineri potuissent Exposuit quid iniquitas loci posset , quid ipse ad Avaricum sensisset , cum sine duce et sine equitatu deprehensis hostibus exploratam victoriam dimisisset , ne parvum modo detrimentum in contentione propter iniquitatem loci accideret . <end>$$On the next day , Caesar , having called a meeting , censured the rashness and avarice of his soldiers , In that they had judged for themselves how far they ought to proceed , or what they ought to do , and could not be kept back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the lieutenants ; and stated , what the disadvantage of the ground could effect , what opinion he himself had entertained at Avaricum , when having surprised the enemy without either general or cavalry , he had given up a certain victory , lest even a trifling loss should occur in the contest owing to the disadvantage of position .
<start> Quanto opere eorum animi magnitudinem admiraretur , quos non castrorum munitiones , non altitudo montis , non murus oppidi tardare potuisset , tanto opere licentiam arrogantiamque reprehendere , quod plus se quam imperatorem de victoria atque exitu rerum sentire existimarent ; nec minus se ab milite modestiam et continentiam quam virtutem atque animi magnitudinem desiderare . <end>$$That as much as he admired the greatness of their courage , since neither the fortifications of the camp , nor the height of the mountain , nor the wall of the town could retard them ; in the same degree he censured their licentiousness and arrogance , because they thought that they knew more than their general concerning victory , and the issue of actions : and that he required in his soldiers forbearance and self-command , not less than valor and magnanimity .
<start> Hac habita contione et ad extremam orationem confirmatis militibus , ne ob hanc causam animo permoverentur neu quod iniquitas loci attulisset id virtuti hostium tribuerent , eadem de profectione cogitans quae ante senserat legiones ex castris eduxit aciemque idoneo loco constituit . <end>$$Having held this assembly , and having encouraged the soldiers at the conclusion of his speech , That they should not be dispirited on this account , nor attribute to the valor of the enemy , what the disadvantage of position had caused ; entertaining the same views of his departure that he had previously had , he led forth the legions from the camp , and drew up his army in order of battle in a suitable place .
<start> Cum Vercingetorix nihil magis in aequum locum descenderet , levi facto equestri proelio atque secundo in castra exercitum reduxit . <end>$$When Vercingetorix , nevertheless , would not descend to the level ground , a slight cavalry action , and that a successful one , having taken place , he led back his army into the camp .
<start> Cum hoc idem postero die fecisset , satis ad Gallicam ostentationem minuendam militumque animos confirmandos factum existimans in Aeduos movit castra . <end>$$When he had done this , the next day , thinking that he had done enough to lower the pride of the Gauls , and to encourage the minds of his soldiers , he moved his camp in the direction of the Aedui .
<start> Ne tum quidem insecutis hostibus tertio die ad flumen Elaver  ; pontem refecit exercitumque traduxit . <end>$$The enemy not even then pursuing us , on the third day he repaired the bridge over the river Allier , and led over his whole army .
<start> Ibi a Viridomaro atque Eporedorige Aeduis appellatus discit cum omni equitatu Litaviccum ad sollicitandos Aeduos profectum : opus esse ipsos antecedere ad confirmandam civitatem . <end>$$Having then held an interview with Viridomarus and Eporedirix the Aeduans , he learns that Litavicus had set out with all the cavalry to raise the Aedui ; that it was necessary that they too should go before him to confirm the state in their allegiance .
<start> Etsi multis iam rebus perfidiam Aeduorum perspectam habebat atque horum discessu admaturari defectionem civitatis existimabat , tamen eos retinendos non constituit , ne aut inferre iniuriam videretur aut dare timoris aliquam suspicionem . <end>$$Although he now saw distinctly the treachery of the Aedui in many things , and was of opinion that the revolt of the entire state would be hastened by their departure ; yet he thought that they should not be detained , lest he should appear either to offer an insult , or betray some suspicion of fear .
<start> Discedentibus his breviter sua in Aeduos merita exposuit , quos et quam humiles accepisset , compulsos in oppida , multatos agris omnibus ereptis copiis , imposito stipendio , obsidibus summa cum contumelia extortis , et quam in fortunam quamque in amplitudinem deduxisset , ut non solum in pristinum statum redissent , sed omnium temporum dignitatem et gratiam antecessisse viderentur . <end>$$He briefly states to them when departing his services toward the Aedui : in what a state and how humbled he had found them , driven into their towns , deprived of their lands , stripped of all their forces , a tribute imposed on them , and hostages wrested from them with the utmost insult ; and to what condition and to what greatness he had raised them , that they had not only recovered their former position , but seemed to surpass the dignity and influence of all the previous eras of their history .
<start> His datis mandatis eos ab se dimisit . <end>$$After giving these admonitions he dismissed them .
<start> Noviodunum erat oppidum Aeduorum ad ripas Ligeris opportuno loco positum . <end>$$Noviodunum was a town of the Aedui , advantageously situated on the banks of the Loire .
<start> Huc Caesar omnes obsides Galliae , frumentum , pecuniam publicam , suorum atque exercitus impedimentorum magnam partem contulerat ; huc magnum numerum equorum huius belli causa in Italia atque Hispania coemptum miserat . <end>$$Caesar had conveyed hither all the hostages of Gaul , the corn , public money , a great part of his own baggage and that of his army ; he had sent hither a great number of horses , which he had purchased in Italy and Spain on account of this war .
<start> Eo cum Eporedorix Viridomarusque venissent et de statu civitatis cognovissent , Litaviccum Bibracti ab Aeduis receptum , quod est oppidum apud eos maximae auctoritatis , Convictolitavim magistratum magnamque partem senatus ad eum convenisse , legatos ad Vercingetorigem de pace et amicitia concilianda publice missos , non praetermittendum tantum commodum existimaverunt . <end>$$When Eporedirix and Viridomarus came to this place , and received information of the disposition of the state , that Litavicus had been admitted by the Aedui into Bibracte , which is a town of the greatest importance among them , that Convictolitanis the chief magistrate and a great part of the senate had gone to meet him , that embassadors had been publicly sent to Vercingetorix to negotiate a peace and alliance ; they thought that so great an opportunity ought not to be neglected .
<start> Itaque interfectis Novioduni custodibus quique eo negotiandi causa convenerant pecuniam atque equos inter se partiti sunt ; obsides civitatum Bibracte ad magistratum deducendos curaverunt ; oppidum , quod a se teneri non posse iudicabant , ne cui esset usui Romanis , incenderunt ; frumenti quod subito potuerunt navibus avexerunt , reliquum flumine atque incendio corruperunt Ipsi ex finitimis regionibus copias cogere , praesidia custodiasque ad ripas Ligeris disponere equitatumque omnibus locis iniciendi timoris causa ostentare coeperunt , si ab re frumentaria Romanos excludere aut adductos inopia in provinciam espellere possent . <end>$$Therefore , having put to the sword the garrison of Noviodunum , and those who had assembled there for the purpose of trading or were on their march , they divided the money and horses among themselves ; they took care that the hostages of the states should be brought to Bibracte , to the chief magistrate ; they burned the town to prevent its being of any service to the Romans , as they were of opinion that they could not hold it ; they carried away in their vessels whatever corn they could in the hurry , they destroyed the remainder , by into the river or setting it on fire , they themselves began to collect forces from the neighboring country , to place guards and garrisons in different positions along the banks of the Loire , and to display the cavalry on all sides to strike terror into the Romans , if they could cut them off from a supply of provisions .
<start> Quam ad spem multum eos adiuvabat , quod Liger ex nivibus creverat , ut omnino vado non posse transiri videretur . <end>$$In which expectation they were much aided , from the circumstance that the Loire had swollen to such a degree from the melting of the snows , that it did not seem capable of being forded at all .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar maturandum sibi censuit , si esset in perficiendis pontibus periclitandum , ut prius quam essent maiores eo coactae copiae dimicaret . <end>$$Caesar on being informed of these movements was of opinion that he ought to make haste , even if he should run some risk in completing the bridges , in order that he might engage before greater forces of the enemy should be collected in that place .
<start> Nam ut commutato consilio iter in provinciam converteret , id ne metu quidem necessario faciendum existimabat ; cum infamia atque indignitas rei et oppositus mons Cevenna viarumque difficultas impediebat , tum maxime quod abiuncto Labieno atque eis legionibus quas una miserat vehementer timebat . <end>$$For no one even then considered it an absolutely necessary act , that changing his design he should direct his march into the Province , both because the infamy and disgrace of the thing , and the intervening mount Cevennes , and the difficulty of the roads prevented him ; and especially because he had serious apprehensions for the safety of Labienus whom he had detached , and those legions whom he had sent with him .
<start> Itaque admodum magnis diurnis nocturnisque itineribus confectis contra omnium opinionem ad Ligerem venit vadoque per equites invento pro rei necessitate opportuno , ut brachia modo atque humeri ad sustinenda arma liberi ab aqua esse possent , disposito equitatu qui vim fluminis refringeret , atque hostibus primo aspectu perturbatis , incolumem exercitum traduxit frumentumque in agris et pecoris copiam nactus repleto his rebus exercitu iter in Senones facere instituit . <end>$$Therefore , having made very long marches by day and night , he came to the river Loire , contrary to the expectation of all ; and having by means of the cavalry , found out a ford , suitable enough considering the emergency , of such depth that their arms and shoulders could be above water for supporting their accoutrements , he dispersed his cavalry in such a manner as to break the force of the current , and having confounded the enemy at the first sight , led his army across the river in safety ; and finding corn and cattle in the fields , after refreshing his army with them , he determined to march into the country of the Senones .
<start> Dum haec apud Caesarem geruntur , Labienus eo supplemento , quod nuper ex Italia venerat , relicto Agedinci , ut esset impedimentis praesidio , cum quattuor legionibus Lutetiam proficiscitur . <end>$$While these things are being done by Caesar , Labienus , leaving at Agendicum the recruits who had lately arrived from Italy , to guard the baggage , marches with four legions to Lutetia , whose arrival being discovered by the enemy , numerous forces arrived from the neighboring states .
<start> Summa imperi traditur Camulogeno Aulerco , qui prope confectus aetate tamen propter singularem scientiam rei militaris ad eum est honorem evocatus . <end>$$The supreme command is intrusted to Camalugenus one of the Aulerci , who , although almost worn out with age , was called to that honor on account of his extraordinary knowledge of military tactics .
<start> Labienus primo vineas agere , cratibus atque aggere paludem explere atque iter munire conabatur . <end>$$Labienus at first attempted to raise Vineae , fill up the marsh with hurdles and clay , and secure a road .
<start> Postquam id difficilius confieri animadvertit , silentio e castris tertia vigilia egressus eodem quo venerat itinere Metiosedum pervenit . <end>$$After he perceived that this was too difficult to accomplish , he issued in silence from his camp at the third watch , and reached Melodunum by the same route by which he came .
<start> Id est oppidum Senonum in insula Sequanae positum , ut paulo ante de Lutetia diximus . <end>$$This is a town of the Senones , situated on an island in the Seine , as we have just before observed of Lutetia .
<start> Deprensis navibus circiter quinquaginta celeriterque coniunctis atque eo militibus iniectis et rei novitate perterritis oppidanis , quorum magna pars erat ad bellum evocata , sine contentione oppido potitur . <end>$$Having seized upon about fifty ships and quickly joined them together , and having placed soldiers in them , he intimidated by his unexpected arrival the inhabitants , of whom a great number had been called out to the war , and obtains possession of the town without a contest .
<start> Refecto ponte , quem superioribus diebus hostes resciderant , exercitum traducit et secundo flumine ad Lutetiam iter facere coepit . <end>$$Having repaired the bridge , which the enemy had broken down during the preceding days , he led over his army , and began to march along the banks of the river to Lutetia .
<start> Hostes re cogmta ab eis , qui Metiosedo fugerant , Lutetiam incendi pontesque eius oppidi rescindi iubent ; ipsi profecti a palude ad ripas Sequanae e regione Lutetiae contra Labieni castra considunt . <end>$$The enemy , on learning the circumstance from those who had escaped from Melodunum , set fire to Lutetia , and order the bridges of that town to be broken down : they themselves set out from the marsh , and take their position on the banks of the Seine , over against Lutetia and opposite the camp of Labienus .
<start> Iam Caesar a Gergovia discessisse audiebatur , iam de Aeduorum defectione et secundo Galliae motu rumores adferebantur , Gallique in colloquiis interclusum itinere et Ligeri Caesarem inopia frumenti coactum in provinciam contendisse confirmabant . <end>$$Caesar was now reported to have departed from Gergovia ; intelligence was likewise brought to them concerning the revolt of the Aedui , and a successful rising in Gaul ; and that Caesar , having been prevented from prosecuting his journey and crossing the Loire , and having been compelled by the want of corn , had marched hastily to the province .
<start> Bellovaci autem defectione Aeduorum cognita , qui ante erant per se infideles , manus cogere atque aperte bellum parare coeperunt . <end>$$But the Bellovaci , who had been previously disaffected of themselves , on learning the revolt of the Aedui , began to assemble forces and openly to prepare for war .
<start> Tum Labienus tanta rerum commutatione longe aliud sibi capiendum consilium adque antea senserat intellegebat , neque iam , ut aliquid adquireret proelioque hostes lacesseret , sed ut incolumem exercitum Agedincum reduceret , cogitabat . <end>$$Then Labienus , as the change in affairs was so great , thought that he must adopt a very different system from what he had previously intended , and he did not now think of making any new acquisitions , or of provoking the enemy to an action ; but that he might bring back his army safe to Agendicum .
<start> Namque altera ex parte Bellovaci , quae civitas in Gallia maximam habet opinionem virtutis , instabant , alteram Camulogenus parato atque instructo exercitu tenebat ; tum legiones a praesidio atque impedimentis interclusas maximum flumen distinebat . <end>$$For , on one side , the Bellovaci , a state which held the highest reputation for prowess in Gaul , were pressing on him ; and Camulogenus , with a disciplined and well-equipped army , held the other side ; moreover , a very great river separated and cut off the legions from the garrison and baggage .
<start> Tantis subito difficultatibus obiectis ab animi virtute auxilium petendum videbat . <end>$$He saw that , in consequence of such great difficulties being thrown in his way , he must seek aid from his own energy of disposition .
<start> Sub vesperum consilio convocato cohortatus ut ea quae imperasset diligenter industrieque administrarent , naves , quas Metiosedo deduxerat , singulas equitibus Romanis attribuit , et prima confecta vigilia quattuor milia passuum secundo flumine silentio progredi ibique se exspectari iubet . <end>$$Having , therefore , called a council of war a little before evening , he exhorted his soldiers to execute with diligence and energy such commands as he should give ; he assigns the ships which he had brought from Melodunum to Roman knights , one to each , and orders them to fall down the river silently for four miles , at the end of the fourth watch , and there wait for him .
<start> Quinque cohortes , quas minime firmas ad dimicandum esse existimabat , castris praesidio relinquit ; quinque eiusdem legionis reliquas de media nocte cum omnibus impedimentis adverso flumine magno tumultu proficisci imperat . <end>$$He leaves the five cohorts , which he considered to be the most steady in action , to guard the camp ; he orders the five remaining cohorts of the same legion to proceed a little after midnight up the river with all their baggage , in a great tumult .
<start> Conquirit etiam lintres : has magno sonitu remorum incitatus in eandem partem mittit . <end>$$He collects also some small boats ; and sends them in the same direction , with orders to make a loud noise in rowing .
<start> Ipse post paulo silentio egressus cum tribus legionibus eum locum petit quo naves appelli iusserat . <end>$$He himself , a little after , marched out in silence , and , at the head of three legions , seeks that place to which he had ordered the ships to be brought .
<start> Eo cum esset ventum , exploratores hostium , ut omni fluminis parte erant dispositi , inopinantes , quod magna subito erat coorta tempestas , ab nostris opprimumtur ; exercitus equitatusque equitibus Romanis administrantibus , quos ei negotio praefecerat , celeriter transmittitur . <end>$$When he had arrived there , the enemy's scouts , as they were stationed along every part of the river , not expecting an attack , because a great storm had suddenly arisen , were surprised by our soldiers : the infantry and cavalry are quickly transported , under the superintendence of the Roman knights , whom he had appointed to that office .
<start> Vno fere tempore sub lucem hostibus nuntiatur in castris Romanorum praeter consuetudinem tumultuari et magnum ire agmen adverso flumine sonitumque remorum in eadem parte exaudiri et paulo infra milites navibus transportari . <end>$$Almost at the same time , a little before daylight , intelligence was given to the enemy that there was an unusual tumult in the camp of the Romans , and that a strong force was marching up the river , and that the sound of oars was distinctly heard in the same quarter , and that soldiers were being conveyed across in ships a little below .
<start> Quibus rebus auditis , quod existimabant tribus locis transire legiones atque omnes perturbatos defectione Aeduorum fugam parare , suas quoque copias in tres partes distribuerunt . <end>$$On hearing these things , because they were of opinion that the legions were passing in three different places , and that the entire army , being terrified by the revolt of the Aedui , were preparing for flight , they divided their forces also into three divisions .
<start> Nam praesidio e regione castrorum relicto et parva manu Metiosedum versus missa , quae tantum progrediatur , quantum naves processissent , reliquas copias contra Labienum duxerunt . <end>$$For leaving a guard opposite to the camp and sending a small body in the direction of Metiosedum , with orders to advance as far as the ships would proceed , they led the rest of their troops against Labienus .
<start> Prima luce et nostri omnes erant transportati , et hostium acies cernebatur . <end>$$By day-break all our soldiers were brought across , and the army of the enemy was in sight .
<start> Labienus milites cohortatus ut suae pristinae virtutis et secundissimorum proeliorum retinerent memoriam atque ipsum Caesarem , cuius ductu saepe numero hostes superassent , praesentem adesse existimarent , dat signum proeli . <end>$$Labienus , having encouraged his soldiers to retain the memory of their ancient valor , and so many most successful actions , and imagine Caesar himself , under whose command they had so often routed the enemy , to be present , gives the signal for action .
<start> Primo concursu ab dextro cornu , ubi septima legio constiterat , hostes pelluntur atque in fugam coniciuntur ; ab sinistro , quem locum duodecima legio tenebat , cum primi ordines hostium transfixi telis concidissent , tamen acerrime reliqui resistebant , nec dabat suspicionem fugae quisquam . <end>$$At the first onset the enemy are beaten and put to flight in the right wing , where the seventh legion stood : on the left wing , which position the twelfth legion held , although the first ranks fell transfixed by the javelins of the Romans , yet the rest resisted most bravely ; nor did any one of them show the slightest intention of flying .
<start> Ipse dux hostium Camulogenus suis aderat atque eos cohortabatur . <end>$$Camulogenus , the general of the enemy , was present and encouraged his troops .
<start> Incerto nunc etiam exitu victoriae , cum septimae legionis tribunis esset nuntiatum quae in sinistro cornu gererentur , post tergum hostium legionem ostenderunt signaque intulerunt . <end>$$But when the issue of the victory was still uncertain , and the circumstances which were taking place on the left wing were announced to the tribunes of the seventh legion , they faced about their legion to the enemy's rear and attacked it : not even then did any one retreat , but all were surrounded and slain .
<start> At ei qui praesidio contra castra Labieni erant relicti , cum proelium commissum audissent , subsidio suis ierunt collemque ceperunt , neque nostrorum militum victorum impetum sustinere potuerunt . <end>$$But those who were left as a guard opposite the camp of Labienus , when they heard that the battle was commenced , marched to aid their countrymen and take possession of a hill , but were unable to withstand the attack of the victorious soldiers .
<start> Sic cum suis fugientibus permixti , quos non silvae montesque texerunt , ab equitatu sunt interfecti . <end>$$In this manner , mixed with their own fugitives , such as the woods and mountains did not shelter were cut to pieces by our cavalry .
<start> Hoc negotio confecto Labienus revertitur Agedincum , ubi impedimenta totius exercitus relicta erant : inde cum omnibus copiis ad Caesarem pervenit . <end>$$When this battle was finished , Labienus returns to Agendicum , where the baggage of the whole army had been left : from it he marched with all his forces to Caesar .
<start> Defectione Aeduorum cognita bellum augetur . <end>$$The revolt of the Aedui being known , the war grows more dangerous .
<start> Legationes in omnes partes circummittuntur : quantum gratia , auctoritate , pecunia valent , ad sollicitandas civitates nituntur ; nacti obsides , quos Caesar apud eos deposuerat , horum supplicio dubitantes territant . <end>$$Embassies are sent by them in all directions : as far as they can prevail by influence , authority , or money , they strive to excite the state  .
<start> Petunt a Vercingetorige Aedui ut ad se veniat rationesque belli gerendi communicet . <end>$$Having got possession of the hostages whom Caesar had deposited with them , they terrify the hesitating by putting them to death .
<start> Re impetrata contendunt ut ipsis summa imperi tradatur , et re in controversiam deducta totius Galliae concilium Bibracte indicitur . <end>$$The Aedui request Vercingetorix to come to them and communicate his plans of conducting the war .
<start> Multitudinis suffragiis res permittitur : ad unum omnes Vercingetorigem probant imperatorem . <end>$$The decision is left to the votes of the mass ; all to a man approve of Vercingetorix as their general .
<start> Ab hoc concilio Remi , Lingones , Treveri afuerunt : illi , quod amicitiam Romanorum sequebantur ; Treveri , quod aberant longius et ab Germanis premebantur , quae fuit causa quare toto abessent bello et neutris auxilia mitterent . <end>$$The Remi , Lingones , and Treviri were absent from this meeting ; the two former because they attached themselves to the alliance of Rome ; the Treviri because they were very remote and were hard pressed by the Germans ; which was also the reason of their being absent during the whole war , and their sending auxiliaries to neither party .
<start> Magno dolore Aedui ferunt se deiectos principatu , queruntur fortunae commutationem et Caesaris indulgentiam in se requirunt , neque tamen suscepto bello suum consilium ab reliquis separare audent . <end>$$The Aedui are highly indignant at being deprived of the chief command ; they lament the change of fortune , and miss Caesar's indulgence toward them ; however , after engaging in the war , they do not dare to pursue their own measures apart from the rest .
<start> Inviti summae spei adulescentes Eporedorix et Viridomarus Vercingetorigi parent . <end>$$Eporedirix and Viridomarus , youths of the greatest promise , submit reluctantly to Vercingetorix .
<start> Ipse imperat reliquis civitatibus obsides diemque ei rei constituit Omnes equites , quindecim milia numero , celeriter convenire iubet ; peditatu quem antea habuerit se fore contentum dicit , neque fortunam temptaturum aut in acie dimicaturum , sed , quoniam abundet equitatu , perfacile esse factu frumentationibus pabulationibusque Romanos prohibere , aequo modo animo sua ipsi frumenta corrumpant aedificiaque incendant , qua rei familiaris iactura perpetuum imperium libertatemque se consequi videant . <end>$$The latter demands hostages from the remaining states ; nay , more , appointed a day for this proceeding ; he orders all the cavalry , fifteen thousand in number , to quickly assemble here ; he says that he will be content with the infantry which he had before , and would not tempt fortune nor come to a regular engagement ; but since he had abundance of cavalry , it would be very easy for him to prevent the Romans from obtaining forage or corn , provided that they themselves should resolutely destroy their corn and set fire to their houses ; by which sacrifice of private property they would evidently obtain perpetual dominion and freedom .
<start> His constitutis rebus Aeduis Segusiavisque , qui sunt finitimi provinciae , decem milia peditum imperat ; huc addit equites octingentos . <end>$$After arranging these matters , he levies ten thousand infantry on the Aedui and Segusiani , who border on our province : to these he adds eight hundred horse .
<start> His praeficit fratrem Eporedorigis bellumque inferri Allobrogibus iubet . <end>$$He sets over them the brother of Eporedirix , and orders him to wage war against the Allobroges .
<start> Altera ex parte Gabalos proximosque pagos Arvernorum in Helvios , item Rutenos Cadurcosque ad fines Volcarum Arecomicorum depopulandos mittit . <end>$$On the other side he sends the Gabali and the nearest cantons of the Arverni against the Helvii ; he likewise sends the Ruteni and Cadurci to lay waste the territories of the Volcae Arecomici .
<start> Nihilo minus clandestinis nuntiis legationibusque Allobrogas sollicitat , quorum mentes nondum ab superiore bello resedisse sperabat . <end>$$Besides , by secret messages and embassies , he tampers with the Allobroges , whose minds , he hopes , had not yet settled down after the excitement of the late war .
<start> Horum principibus pecunias , civitati autem imperium totius provinciae pollicetur . <end>$$To their nobles he promises money , and to their state the dominion of the whole province .
<start> Ad hos omnes casus provisa erant praesidia cohortium duarum et viginti , quae ex ipsa provincia ab Lucio Caesare legato ad omnes partes opponebantur . <end>$$The only guards provided against all these contingencies were twenty-two cohorts , which were collected from the entire province by Lucius Caesar , the lieutenant , and opposed to the enemy in every quarter .
<start> Helvii sua sponte cum finitimis proelio congressi pelluntur et Gaio Valerio Donnotauro , Caburi filio , principe civitatis , compluribusque aliis interfectis intra oppida ac muros compelluntur . <end>$$The Helvii , voluntarily engaging in battle with their neighbors , are defeated , and Caius Valerius Donotaurus , the son of Caburus , the principal man of the state , and several others , being slain , they are forced to retire within their towns and fortifications .
<start> Allobroges crebris ad Rhodanum dispositis praesidiis magna cum cura et diligentia suos fines tuentur . <end>$$The Allobroges , placing guards along the course of the Rhone , defend their frontiers with great vigilance and energy .
<start> Caesar , quod hostes equitatu superiores esse intellegebat et interclusis omnibus itineribus nulla re ex provincia atque Italia sublevari poterat , trans Rhenum in Germaniam mittit ad eas civitates quas superioribus annis pacaverat , equitesque ab his arcessit et levis armaturae pedites , qui inter eos proeliari consuerant . <end>$$Caesar , as he perceived that the enemy were superior in cavalry , and he himself could receive no aid from the Province or Italy , while all communication was cut off , sends across the Rhine into Germany to those states which he had subdued in the preceding campaigns , and summons from them cavalry and the light-armed infantry , who were accustomed to engage among them .
<start> Eorum adventu , quod minus idoneis equis utebantur , a tribunis militum reliquisque equitibus Romanis atque evocatis equos sumit Germanisque distribuit . <end>$$On their arrival , as they were mounted on unserviceable horses , he takes horses from the military tribunes and the rest , nay , even from the Roman knights and veterans , and distributes them among the Germans .
<start> Interea , dum haec geruntur , hostium copiae ex Arvernis equitesque qui toti Galliae erant imperati conveniunt . <end>$$In the mean time , whilst these things are going on , the forces of the enemy from the Arverni , and the cavalry which had been demanded from all Gaul , meet together .
<start> Si pedites suis auxilium ferant atque in eo morentur , iter facere non posse ; si , id quod magis futurum confidat , relictis impedimentis suae saluti consulant , et usu rerum necessariarum et dignitate spoliatum iri . <end>$$For as to the enemy's horse , they ought not to entertain a doubt that none of them would dare to advance beyond the main body .
<start> Nam de equitibus hostium , quin nemo eorum progredi modo extra agmen audeat , et ipsos quidem non debere dubitare , et quo maiore faciant animo , copias se omnes pro castris habiturum et terrori hostibus futurum . <end>$$In order that they may do so with greater spirit , he would marshal all their forces before the camp , and intimidate the enemy .
<start> Conclamant equites sanctissimo iureiurando confirmari oportere , ne tecto recipiatur , ne ad liberos , ne ad parentes , ad uxorem aditum habeat , qui non bis per agmen hostium perequitasset . <end>$$The cavalry unanimously shout out , That they ought to bind themselves by a most sacred oath , that he should not be received under a roof , nor have access to his children , parents , or wife , who shall not twice have ridden through the enemy's army .
<start> Probata re atque omnibus iureiurando adactis postero die in tres partes distributo equitatu duae se acies ab duobus lateribus ostendunt , una primo agmine iter impedire coepit . <end>$$This proposal receiving general approbation , and all being forced to take the oath , on the next day the cavalry were divided into three parts , and two of these divisions made a demonstration on our two flanks ; while one in front began to obstruct our march .
<start> Qua re nuntiata Caesar suum quoque equitatum tripertito divisum contra hostem ire iubet . <end>$$On this circumstance being announced , Caesar orders his cavalry also to form three divisions and charge the enemy .
<start> Pugnatur una omnibus in partibus Consistit agmen ; impedimenta intra legiones recipiuntur . <end>$$Then the action commences simultaneously in every part : the main body halts ; the baggage is received within the ranks of the legions .
<start> Si qua in parte nostri laborare aut gravius premi videbantur , eo signa inferri Caesar aciemque constitui iubebat ; quae res et hostes ad insequendum tardabat et nostros spe auxili confirmabat . <end>$$If our men seemed to be distressed , or hard pressed in any quarter , Caesar usually ordered the troops to advance , and the army to wheel round in that quarter ; which conduct retarded the enemy in the pursuit , and encouraged our men by the hope of support .
<start> Tandem Germani ab dextro latere summum iugum nacti hostes loco depellunt ; fugientes usque ad flumen , ubi Vercingetorix cum pedestribus copiis consederat , persecuntur compluresque interficiunt . <end>$$At length the Germans , on the right wing , having gained the top of the hill , dislodge the enemy from their position and pursue them even as far as the river at which Vercingetorix with the infantry was stationed , and slay several of them .
<start> Qua re animadversa reliqui ne circumirentur veriti se fugae mandant . <end>$$The rest , on observing this action , fearing lest they should be surrounded , betake themselves to flight .
<start> Omnibus locis fit caedes Tres nobilissimi Aedui capti ad Caesarem perducuntur : Cotus , praefectus equitum , qui controversiam cum Convictolitavi proximis comitiis habuerat , et Cavarillus , qui post defectionem Litavicci pedestribus copiis praefuerat , et Eporedorix , quo duce ante adventum Caesaris Aedui cum Sequanis bello contenderant . <end>$$A slaughter ensues in every direction , and three of the noblest of the Aedui are taken and brought to Caesar : Cotus , the commander of the cavalry , who had been engaged in the contest with Convictolitanis the last election , Cavarillus , who had held the command of the infantry after the revolt of Litavicus , and Eporedirix , under whose command the Aedui had engaged in war against the Sequani , before the arrival of Caesar .
<start> Fugato omni equitatu Vercingetorix copias , ut pro castris collocaverat , reduxit protinusque Alesiam , quod est oppidum Mandubiorum , iter facere coepit celeriterque impedimenta ex castris educi et se subsequi iussit . <end>$$All his cavalry being routed , Vercingetorix led back his troops in the same order as he had arranged them before the camp , and immediately began to march to Alesia , which is a town of the Mandubii , and ordered the baggage to be speedily brought forth from the camp , and follow him closely .
<start> Caesar impedimentis in proximum collem deductis , duabus legionibus praesidio relictis , secutus quantum diei tempus est passum , circiter tribus milibus hostium ex novissimo agmine interfectis altero die ad Alesiam castra fecit . <end>$$Caesar , having conveyed his baggage to the nearest hill , and having left two legions to guard it , pursued as far as the time of day would permit , and after slaying about three thousand of the rear of the enemy , encamped at Alesia on the next day .
<start> Perspecto urbis situ perterritisque hostibus , quod equitatu , qua maxime parte exercitus confidebant , erant pulsi , adhortatus ad laborem milites circumvallare instituit . <end>$$On reconnoitering the situation of the city , finding that the enemy were panic-stricken , because the cavalry in which they placed their chief reliance , were beaten , he encouraged his men to endure the toil , and began to draw a line of circumvallation round Alesia .
<start> Ipsum erat oppidum Alesia in colle summo admodum edito loco , ut nisi obsidione expugnari non posse videretur ; cuius collis radices duo duabus ex partibus flumina subluebant . <end>$$The town itself was situated on the top of a hill , in a very lofty position , so that it did not appear likely to be taken , except by a regular siege .
<start> Ante id oppidum planities circiter milia passuum tria in longitudinem patebat : reliquis ex omnibus partibus colles mediocri interiecto spatio pari altitudinis fastigio oppidum cingebant . <end>$$Two rivers , on two different sides , washed the foot of the hill Before the town lay a plain of about three miles in length ; on every other side hills at a moderate distance , and of an equal degree of height , surrounded the town .
<start> Sub muro , quae pars collis ad orientem solem spectabat , hunc omnem locum copiae Gallorum compleverant fossamque et maceriam sex in altitudinem pedum praeduxerant . <end>$$The army of the Gauls had filled all the space under the wall , comprising a part of the hill which looked to the rising sun , and had drawn in front a trench and a stone wall six feet high .
<start> Eius munitionis quae ab Romanis instituebatur circuitus XI milia passuum tenebat . <end>$$The circuit of that fortification , which was commenced by the Romans , comprised eleven miles .
<start> Castra opportunis locis erant posita ibique castella viginti tria facta , quibus in castellis interdiu stationes ponebantur , ne qua subito eruptio fieret : haec eadem noctu excubitoribus ac firmis praesidiis tenebantur . <end>$$The camp was pitched in a strong position , and twenty-three redoubts were raised in it , in which sentinels were placed by day , lest any sally should be made suddenly ; and by night the same were occupied by watches and strong guards .
<start> Opere instituto fit equestre proelium in ea planitie , quam intermissam collibus tria milia passuum in longitudinem patere supra demonstravimus . <end>$$The work having been begun , a cavalry action ensues in that plain , which we have already described as broken by hills , and extending three miles in length .
<start> Praesidio legionum addito nostris animus augetur : hostes in fugam coniecti se ipsi multitudine impediunt atque angustioribus portis relictis coacervantur . <end>$$The contest is maintained on both sides with the utmost vigor ; Caesar sends the Germans to aid our troops when distressed , and draws up the legions in front of the camp , lest any sally should be suddenly made by the enemy's infantry .
<start> Paulum legiones Caesar quas pro vallo constituerat promoveri iubet . <end>$$A great slaughter ensues ; some leave their horses , and endeavor to cross the ditch and climb the wall .
<start> Non minus qui intra munitiones erant perturbantur Galli : veniri ad se confestim existimantes ad arma conclamant ; nonnulli perterriti in oppidum irrumpunt . <end>$$Caesar orders the legions which he had drawn up in front of the rampart to advance a little .
<start> Vercingetorix , priusquam munitiones ab Romanis perficiantur , consilium capit omnem ab se equitatum noctu dimittere . <end>$$Vercingetorix adopts the design of sending away all his cavalry by night , before the fortifications should be completed by the Romans .
<start> Discedentibus mandat ut suam quisque eorum civitatem adeat omnesque qui per aetatem arma ferre possint ad bellum cogant Sua in illos merita proponit obtestaturque ut suae salutis rationem habeant neu se optime de communi libertate meritum in cruciatum hostibus dedant Quod si indiligentiores fuerint , milia hominum delecta octoginta una secum interitura demonstrat . <end>$$He charges them when departing that each of them should go to his respective state , and press for the war all who were old enough to bear arms ; he states his own merits , and conjures them to consider his safety , and not surrender him who had deserved so well of the general freedom , to the enemy for torture ; he points out to them that , if they should be remiss , eighty thousand chosen men would perish with him ; that upon making a calculation , he had barely corn for thirty days , but could hold out a little longer by economy .
<start> Ratione inita se exigue dierum triginta habere frumentum , sed paulo etiam longius tolerari posse parcendo His datis mandatis , qua opus erat intermissum , secunda vigilia silentio equitatum mittit Frumentum omne ad se referri iubet ; capitis poenam eis qui non paruerint constituit : pecus , cuius magna erat copia ab Mandubiis compulsa , viritim distribuit ; frumentum parce et paulatim metiri instituit ; copias omnes quas pro oppido collocaverat in oppidum recepit . <end>$$After giving these instructions he silently dismisses the cavalry in the second watch , where our works were not completed ; he orders all the corn to be brought to himself ; he ordains capital punishment to such as should not obey ; he distributes among them , man by man , the cattle , great quantities of which had been driven there by the Mandubii ; he began to measure out the corn sparingly , and by little and little ; he receives into the town all the forces which he had posted in front of it .
<start> His rationibus auxilia Galliae exspectare et bellum parat administrare . <end>$$In this manner he prepares to await the succors from Gaul , and carry on the war .
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis ex perfugis et captivis , Caesar haec genera munitionis instituit Fossam pedum viginti directis lateribus duxit , ut eius fossae solum tantundem pateret quantum summae fossae labra distarent . <end>$$Caesar , on learning these proceedings from the deserters and captives , adopted the following system of fortification ; he dug a trench twenty feet deep , with perpendicular sides , in such a manner that the base of this trench should extend so far as the edges were apart at the top .
<start> Reliquas omnes munitiones ab ea fossa pedes quadringentos reduxit , hoc consilio , quoniam tantum esset necessario spatium complexus , nec facile totum corpus corona militum cingeretur , ne de improviso aut noctu ad munitiones hostium multitudo advolaret aut interdiu tela in nostros operi destinatos conicere possent . <end>$$He raised all his other works at a distance of four hundred feet from that ditch ; that with this intention , lest a large number of the enemy should suddenly , or by night , sally against the fortifications ; or lest they should by day cast weapons against our men while occupied with the works .
<start> Hoc intermisso spatio duas fossas quindecim pedes latas , eadem altitudine perduxit , quarum interiorem campestribus ac demissis locis aqua ex flumine derivata complevit . <end>$$Having left this interval , he drew two trenches fifteen feet broad , and of the same depth ; the innermost of them , being in low and level ground , he filled with water conveyed from the river .
<start> Post eas aggerem ac vallum duodecim pedum exstruxit Huic loricam pinnasque adiecit grandibus cervis eminentibus ad commissuras pluteorum atque aggeris , qui ascensum hostium tardarent , et turres toto opere circumdedit , quae pedes LXXX inter se distarent . <end>$$Behind these he raised a rampart and wall twelve feet high ; to this he added a parapet and battlements , with large stakes cut like stags' horns , projecting from the junction of the parapet and battlements , to prevent the enemy from scaling it , and surrounded the entire work with turrets , which were eighty feet distant from one another .
<start> Erat eodem tempore et materiari et frumentari et tantas munitiones fieri necesse deminutis nostris copiis quae longius ab castris progrediebantur : ac nonnum quam opera nostra Galli temptare atque eruptionem ex oppido pluribus portis summa vi facere conabantur . <end>$$It was necessary , at one and the same time , to procure timber , lay in supplies of corn , and raise also extensive fortifications , and the available troops were in consequence of this reduced in number , since they used to advance to some distance from the camp , and sometimes the Gauls endeavored to attack our works , and to make a sally from the town by several gates and in great force .
<start> Quare ad haec rursus opera addendum Caesar putavit , quo minore numero militum munitiones defendi possent . <end>$$Caesar thought that further additions should be made to these works , in order that the fortifications might be defensible by a small number of soldiers .
<start> Itaque truncis arborum aut admodum firmis ramis abscisis atque horum delibratis ac praeacutis cacuminibus perpetuae fossae quinos pedes altae ducebantur . <end>$$Having , therefore , cut down the trunks of trees or very thick branches , and having stripped their tops of the bark , and sharpened them into a point , he drew a continued trench every where five feet deep .
<start> Quini erant ordines coniuncti inter se atque implicati ; quo qui intraverant , se ipsi acutissimis vallis induebant . <end>$$There were five rows in connection with , and intersecting each other ; and whoever entered within them were likely to impale themselves on very sharp stakes .
<start> Hos cippos appellabant . <end>$$The soldiers called these cippi .
<start> Ante quos obliquis ordinibus in quincuncem dispositis scrobes tres in altitudinem pedes fodiebantur paulatim angustiore ad infimum fastigio . <end>$$Before these , which were arranged in oblique rows in the form of a quincunx , pits three feet deep were dug , which gradually diminished in depth to the bottom .
<start> Huc teretes stipites feminis crassitudine ab summo praeacuti et praeusti demittebantur , ita ut non amplius digitis quattuor ex terra eminerent ; simul confirmandi et stabiliendi causa singuli ab infimo solo pedes terra exculcabantur , reliqua pars scrobis ad occultandas insidias viminibus ac virgultis integebatur . <end>$$In these pits tapering stakes , of the thickness of a man's thigh ; sharpened at the top and hardened in the fire , were sunk in such a manner as to project from the ground not more than four inches ; at the same time for the purpose of giving them strength and stability , they were each filled with trampled clay to the height of one foot from the bottom : the rest of the pit was covered over with osiers and twigs , to conceal the deceit .
<start> Huius generis octoni ordines ducti ternos inter se pedes distabant . <end>$$Eight rows of this kind were dug , and were three feet distant from each other .
<start> Id ex similitudine floris lilium appellabant . <end>$$They called this a lily from its resemblance to that flower .
<start> Ante haec taleae pedem longae ferreis hamis infixis totae in terram infodiebantur mediocribusque intermissis spatiis omnibus locis disserebantur ; quos stimulos nominabant . <end>$$Stakes a foot long , with iron hooks attached to them , were entirely sunk in the ground before these , and were planted in every place at small intervals ; these they called spurs .
<start> His rebus perfectis regiones secutus quam potuit aequissimas pro loci natura quattuordecim milia passuum complexus pares eiusdem generis munitiones , diversas ab bis , contra exteriorem hostem perfecit , ut ne magna quidem multitudine , si ita accidat , munitionum praesidia circumfundi possent ; ac ne cum periculo ex castris egredi cogatur , dierum triginta pabulum frumentumque habere omnes convectum iubet . <end>$$After completing these works , saving selected as level ground as he could , considering the nature of the country , and having inclosed an area of fourteen miles , he constructed , against an external enemy , fortifications of the same kind in every respect , and separate from these , so that the guards of the fortifications could not be surrounded even by immense numbers , if such a circumstance should take place owing to the departure of the enemy's cavalry ; and in order that the Roman soldiers might not be compelled to go out of the camp with great risk , he orders all to provide forage and corn for thirty days .
<start> Dum haec apud Alesiam geruntur , Galli concilio principum indicto non omnes eos qui arma ferre possent , ut censuit Vercingetorix , convocandos statuunt , sed certum numerum cuique ex civitate imperandum , ne tanta multitudine confusa nec moderari nec discernere suos nec frumentandi rationem habere possent . <end>$$While those things are carried on at Alesia , the Gauls , having convened a council of their chief nobility , determine that all who could bear arms should not be called out , which was the opinion of Vercingetorix , but that a fixed number should be levied from each state ; lest , when so great a multitude assembled together , they could neither govern nor distinguish their men , nor have the means of supplying them with corn .
<start> Imperant Aeduis atque eorum clientibus , Segusiavis , Ambivaretis , Aulercis Brannovicibus , Blannoviis , milia XXXV ; parem numerum Arvernis adiunctis Eleutetis , Cadurcis , Gabalis , Vellaviis , qui sub imperio Arvernorum esse consuerunt ; Sequanis , Senonibus , Biturigibus , Santonis , Rutenis , Carnutibus duodena milia ; Bellovacis X ; totidem Lemovicibus ; octona Pictonibus et Turonis et Parisiis et Helvetiis ; Ambianis , Mediomatricis , Petrocoriis , Nerviis , Morinis , Nitiobrigibus quina milia ; Aulercis Cenomanis totidem ; Atrebatibus ; Veliocassis , Lexoviis et Aulercis Eburovicibus terna ; Rauracis et Boiis bina ; universis civitatibus , quae Oceanum attingunt quaeque eorum consuetudine Armoricae appellantur , quo sunt in numero Curiosolites , Redones , Ambibarii , Caletes , Osismi , Veneti , Lemovices , Venelli . <end>$$They demand thirty-five thousand men from the Aedui and their dependents , the Segusiani , Ambivareti , and Aulerci Brannovices ; an equal number from the Arverni in conjunction with the Eleuteti Cadurci , Gabali , and Velauni , who were accustomed to be under the command of the Arverni ; twelve thousand each from the Senones , Sequani , Bituriges , Sentones , Ruteni , and Carnutes ; ten thousand from the Bellovaci ; the same number from the Lemovici ; eight thousand each from the Pictones , and Turoni , and Parisii , and Helvii ; five thousand each from the Suessiones , Ambiani , Mediomatrici , Petrocorii , Nervii , Morini , and Nitiobriges ; the same number from the Aulerci Cenomani ; four thousand from the Atrebates ; three thousand each from the Bellocassi , Lexovii , and Aulerci Eburovices ; thirty thousand from the Rauraci , and Boii ; six thousand from all the states together , which border on the Atlantic , and which in their dialect are called Armoricae  .
<start> Ex his Bellovaci suum numerum non compleverunt , quod se suo nomine atque arbitrio cum Romanis bellum gesturos dicebant neque cuiusquam imperio obtemperaturos ; rogati tamen ab Commio pro eius hospitio duo milia una miserunt . <end>$$Of these the Bellovaci did not contribute their number , as they said that they would wage war against the Romans on their own account , and at their own discretion , and would not obey the order of any one : however , at the request of Commius , they sent two thousand , in consideration of a tie of hospitality which subsisted between him and them .
<start> Huius opera Commi , ut antea demonstravimus , fideli atque utili superioribus annis erat usus in Britannia Caesar ; quibus ille pro meritis civitatem eius immunem esse iusserat , iura legesque reddiderat atque ipsi Morinos attribuerat . <end>$$Caesar had , as we have previously narrated , availed himself of the faithful and valuable services of this Commius , in Britain , in former years : in consideration of which merits he had exempted from taxes his state , and had conferred on Commius himself the country of the Morini .
<start> Tamen tanta universae Galliae consensio fuit libertatis vindicandae et pristinae belli laudis recuperandae , ut neque beneficiis neque amicitiae memoria moverentur , omnesque et animo et opibus in id bellum incumberent . <end>$$Yet such was the unanimity of the Gauls in asserting their freedom , and recovering their ancient renown in war , that they were influenced neither by favors , nor by the recollection of private friendship ; and all earnestly directed their energies and resources to that war , and collected eight thousand cavalry , and about two hundred and forty thousand infantry .
<start> Coactis equitum VIII milibus et peditum circiter CCL haec in Aeduorum finibus recensebantur , numerusque inibatur , praefecti constituebantur Commio Atrebati , Viridomaro et Eporedorigi Aeduis , Vercassivellauno Arverno , consobrino Vercingetorigis , summa imperi traditur . <end>$$These were reviewed in the country of the Aedui , and a calculation was made of their numbers : commanders were appointed : the supreme command is intrusted to Commius the Atrebatian , Viridomarus and Eporedirix the Aeduans , and Vergasillaunus the Arvernan , the cousin-german of Vercingetorix .
<start> His delecti ex civitatibus attribuuntur , quorum consilio bellum administraretur . <end>$$To them are assigned men selected from each state , by whose advice the war should be conducted .
<start> Omnes alacres et fiduciae pleni ad Alesiam proficiscuntur , neque erat omnium quisquam qui aspectum modo tantae multitudinis sustineri posse arbitraretur , praesertim ancipiti proelio , cum ex oppido eruptione pugnaretur , foris tantae copiae equitatus peditatusque cernerentur . <end>$$All march to Alesia , sanguine and full of confidence : nor was there a single individual who imagined that the Romans could withstand the sight of such an immense host : especially in an action carried on both in front and rear , when the besieged would sally from the town and attack the enemy , and on the outside so great forces of cavalry and infantry would be seen .
<start> At ei , qui Alesiae obsidebantur praeterita die , qua auxilia suorum exspectaverant , consumpto omni frumento , inscii quid in Aeduis gereretur , concilio coacto de exitu suarum fortunarum consultabant . <end>$$But those who were blockaded at Alesia , the day being past , on which they had expected auxiliaries from their countrymen , and all their corn being consumed ignorant of what was going on among the Aedui , convened an assembly and deliberated on the exigency of their situation .
<start> Ac variis dictis sententiis , quarum pars deditionem , pars , dum vires suppeterent , eruptionem censebat , non praetereunda oratio Critognati videtur propter eius singularem et nefariam crudelitatem . <end>$$After various opinions had been expressed among them , some of which proposed a surrender , others a sally , while their strength would support it , the speech of Critognatus ought not to be omitted for its singular and detestable cruelty .
<start> Hic summo in Arvernis ortus loco et magnae habitus auctoritatis , Nihil , inquit , de eorum sententia dicturus sum , qui turpissimam servitutem deditionis nomine appellant , neque hos habendos civium loco neque ad concilium adhibendos censeo . <end>$$He sprung from the noblest family among the Arverni , and possessing great influence , says , I shall pay no attention to the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender by the name of a capitulation ; nor do I think that they ought to be considered as citizens , or summoned to the council .
<start> Cum his mihi res sit , qui eruptionem probant ; quorum in consilio omnium vestrum consensu pristinae residere virtutis memoria videtur . <end>$$My business is with those who approve of a sally : in whose advice the memory of our ancient prowess seems to dwell in the opinion of you all .
<start> Animi est ista mollitia , non virtus , paulisper inopiam ferre non posse . <end>$$To be unable to bear privation for a short time is disgraceful cowardice , not true valor .
<start> Qui se ultro morti offerant facilius reperiuntur quam qui dolorem patienter ferant . <end>$$Those who voluntarily offer themselves to death are more easily found than those who would calmly endure distress .
<start> Atque ego hanc sententiam probarem , si nullam praeterquam vitae nostrae iacturam fieri viderem : sed in consilio capiendo omnem Galliam respiciamus , quam ad nostrum auxilium concitavimus . <end>$$And I would approve of this opinion , could I foresee no other loss , save that of life ; but let us , in adopting our design , look back on all Gaul , which we have stirred up to our aid .
<start> Quid hominum milibus LXXX uno loco interfectis propinquis consanguineisque nostris animi fore existimatis , si paene in ipsis cadaveribus proelio decertare cogentur ? Nolite hos vestro auxilio exspoliare , qui vestrae salutis causa suum periculum neglexerunt , nec stultitia ac temeritate vestra aut animi imbecillitate omnem Galliam prosternere et perpetuae servituti subicere . <end>$$What courage do you think would our relatives and friends have , if eighty thousand men were butchered in one spot , supposing that they should be forced to come to an action almost over our corpses ? Do not utterly deprive them of your aid , for they have spurned all thoughts of personal danger on account of your safety ; nor by your folly , rashness , and cowardice , crush all Gaul and doom it to an eternal slavery .
<start> An , quod ad diem non venerunt , de eorum fide constantiaque dubitatis ? Quid ergo ? Romanos in illis ulterioribus munitionibus animine causa cotidie exerceri putatis ? Si illorum nuntiis confirmari non potestis omni aditu praesaepto , his utimini testibus appropinquare eorum adventum ; cuius rei timore exterriti diem noctemque in opere versantur . <end>$$Do you doubt their fidelity and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day ? What then ? Do you suppose that the Romans are employed every day in the outer fortifications for mere amusement ? If you can not be assured by their dispatches , since every avenue is blocked up , take the Romans as evidence that their approach is drawing near ; since they , intimidated by alarm at this , labor night and day at their works .
<start> Quid ergo mei consili est ? Facere , quod nostri maiores nequaquam pari bello Cimbrorum Teutonumque fecerunt ; qui in oppida compulsi ac simili inopia subacti eorum corporibus qui aetate ad bellum inutiles videbantur vitam toleraverunt neque se hostibus tradiderunt . <end>$$What , therefore , is my design ? To do as our ancestors did in the war against the Cimbri and Teutones , which was by no means equally momentous who , when driven into their towns , and oppressed by similar privations , supported life by the corpses of those who appeared useless for war on account of their age , and did not surrender to the enemy : and even if we had not a precedent for such cruel conduct , still I should consider it most glorious that one should be established , and delivered to posterity .
<start> Cuius rei si exemplum non haberemus , tamen libertatis causa institui et posteris prodi pulcherrimum iudicarem Nam quid illi simile bello fuit ? Depopulata Gallia Cimbri magnaque illata calamitate finibus quidem nostris aliquando excesserunt atque alias terras petierunt ; iura , leges , agros , libertatem nobis reliquerunt . <end>$$For in what was that war like this ? The Cimbri , after laying Gaul waste , and inflicting great calamities , at length departed from our country , and sought other lands ; they left us our rights , laws , lands , and liberty .
<start> Romani vero quid petunt aliud aut quid volunt , nisi invidia adducti , quos fama nobiles potentesque bello cognoverunt , horum in agris civitatibusque considere atque his aeternam iniungere servitutem ? Neque enim ulla alia condicione bella gesserunt . <end>$$But what other motive or wish have the Romans , than , induced by envy , to settle in the lands and states of those whom they have learned by fame to be noble and powerful in war , and impose on them perpetual slavery ? For they never have carried on wars on any other terms .
<start> Quod si ea quae in longinquis nationibus geruntur ignoratis , respicite finitimam Galliam , quae in provinciam redacta iure et legibus commutatis securibus subiecta perpetua premitur servitute . <end>$$But if you know not these things which are going on in distant countries , look to the neighboring Gaul , which being reduced to the form of a province , stripped of its rights and laws , and subjected to Roman despotism , is oppressed by perpetual slavery .
<start> Sententiis dictis constituunt ut ei qui valetudine aut aetate inutiles sunt bello oppido excedant , atque omnia prius experiantur , quam ad Critognati sententiam descendant : illo tamen potius utendum consilio , si res cogat atque auxilia morentur , quam aut deditionis aut pacis subeundam condicionem . <end>$$When different opinions were expressed , they determined that those who , owing to age or ill health , were unserviceable for war , should depart from the town , and that themselves should try every expedient before they had recourse to the advice of Critognatus : however , that they would rather adopt that design , if circumstances should compel them and their allies should delay , than accept any terms of a surrender or peace .
<start> Mandubii , qui eos oppido receperant , cum liberis atque uxoribus exire coguntur . <end>$$The Mandubii , who had admitted them into the town , are compelled to go forth with their wives and children .
<start> Hi , cum ad munitiones Romanorum accessissent , flentes omnibus precibus orabant , ut se in servitutem receptos cibo iuvarent . <end>$$When these came to the Roman fortifications , weeping , they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to receive them as slaves and relieve them with food .
<start> At Caesar dispositis in vallo custodibus recipi prohibebat . <end>$$But Caesar , placing guards on the rampart , forbade them to be admitted .
<start> Interea Commius reliquique duces quibus summa imperi permissa erat cum omnibus copiis ad Alesiam perveniunt et colle exteriore occupato non longius mille passibus ab nostris munitionibus considunt . <end>$$In the mean time , Commius and the rest of the leaders , to whom the supreme command had been intrusted , came with all their forces to Alesia , and having occupied the entire hill , encamped not more than a mile from our fortifications .
<start> Postero die equitatu ex castris educto omnem eam planitiem , quam in longitudinem tria milia passuum patere demonstravimus , complent pedestresque copias paulum ab eo loco abditas in locis superioribus constituunt . <end>$$The following day , having led forth their cavalry from the camp , they fill all that plain , which , we have related , extended three miles in length , and drew out their infantry a little from that place , and post them on the higher ground .
<start> Erat ex oppido Alesia despectus in campum . <end>$$The town Alesia commanded a view of the whole plain .
<start> Concurrunt his auxiliis visis ; fit gratulatio inter eos , atque omnium animi ad laetitiam excitantur . <end>$$The besieged run together when these auxiliaries were seen ; mutual congratulations ensue , and the minds of all are elated with joy .
<start> Itaque productis copiis ante oppidum considunt et proximam fossam cratibus integunt atque aggere explent seque ad eruptionem atque omnes casus comparant . <end>$$Accordingly , drawing out their troops , they encamp before the town , and cover the nearest trench with hurdles and fill it up with earth , and make ready for a sally and every casualty .
<start> Caesar omni exercitu ad utramque partem munitionum disposito , ut , si usus veniat , suum quisque locum teneat et noverit , equitatum ex castris educi et proelium committi iubet . <end>$$Caesar , having stationed his army on both sides of the fortifications , in order that , if occasion should arise , each should hold and know his own post , orders the cavalry to issue forth from the camp and commence action .
<start> Erat ex omnibus castris , quae summum undique iugum tenebant , despectus , atque omnes milites intenti pugnae proventum exspectabant . <end>$$There was a commanding view from the entire camp , which occupied a ridge of hills ; and the minds of all the soldiers anxiously awaited the issue of the battle .
<start> Galli inter equites raros sagittarios expeditosque levis armaturae interiecerant , qui suis cedentibus auxilio succurrerent et nostrorum equitum impetus sustinerent . <end>$$The Gauls had scattered archers and light-armed infantry here and there , among their cavalry , to give relief to their retreating troops , and sustain the impetuosity of our cavalry .
<start> Ab his complures de improviso vuluerati proelio excedebant . <end>$$Several of our soldiers were unexpectedly wounded by these , and left the battle .
<start> Cum suos pugna superiores esse Galli confiderent et nostros multitudine premi viderent , ex omnibus partibus et ei qui munitionibus continebantur et hi qui ad auxilium convenerant clamore et ululatu suorum animos confirmabant . <end>$$When the Gauls were confident that their countrymen were the conquerors in the action , and beheld our men hard pressed by numbers , both those who were hemmed in by the line of circumvallation and those who had come to aid them , supported the spirits of their men by shouts and yells from every quarter .
<start> Quod in conspectu omnium res gerebatur neque recte ac turpiter factum celari poterat , utrosque et laudis cupiditas et timor ignominiae ad virtutem excitabant . <end>$$As the action was carried on in sight of all , neither a brave nor cowardly act could be concealed ; both the desire of praise and the fear of ignominy , urged on each party to valor .
<start> Cum a meridie prope ad solis occasum dubia victoria pugnaretur , Germani una in parte confertis turmis in hostes impetum fecerunt eosque propulerunt ; quibus in fugam coniectis sagittarii circumventi interfectique sunt . <end>$$After fighting from noon almost to sunset , without victory inclining in favor of either , the Germans , on one side , made a charge against the enemy in a compact body , and drove them back ; and , when they were put to flight , the archers were surrounded and cut to pieces .
<start> Item ex reliquis partibus nostri cedentes usque ad castra insecuti sui colligendi facultatem non dederunt . <end>$$In other parts , likewise , our men pursued to the camp the retreating enemy , and did not give them an opportunity of rallying .
<start> At ei qui ab Alesia processerant maesti prope victoria desperata se in oppidum receperunt . <end>$$But those who had come forth from Alesia returned into the town dejected and almost despairing of success .
<start> Vno die intermisso Galli atque hoc spatio magno cratium , scalarum , harpagonum numero effecto media nocte silentio ex castris egressi ad campestres munitiones accedunt . <end>$$The Gauls , after the interval of a day and after making , during that time , an immense number of hurdles , scaling-ladders , and iron hooks , silently went forth from the camp at midnight and approached the fortifications in the plain .
<start> Subito clamore sublato , qua significatione qui in oppido obsidebantur de suo adventu cognoscere possent , crates proicere , fundis , sagittis , lapidibus nostros de vallo proturbare reliquaque quae ad oppugnationem pertinent parant administrare . <end>$$Raising a shout suddenly , that by this intimation those who were beseiged in the town might learn their arrival , they began to cast down hurdles and dislodge our men from the rampart by slings , arrows , and stones , and executed the other movements which are requisite in storming .
<start> Eodem tempore clamore exaudito dat tuba signum suis Vercingetorix atque ex oppido educit . <end>$$At the same time , Vercingetorix , having heard the shout , gives the signal to his troops by a trumpet , and leads them forth from the town .
<start> Nostri , ut superioribus diebus , ut cuique erat locus attributus , ad munitiones accedunt ; fundis librilibus sudibusque quas in opere disposuerant ac glandibus Gallos proterrent . <end>$$Our troops , as each man's post had been assigned him some days before , man the fortifications ; they intimidate the Gauls by slings , large stones , stakes which they had placed along the works , and bullets .
<start> Prospectu tenebris adempto multa utrimque vulnera accipiuntur Complura tormentis tela coniciuntur . <end>$$All view being prevented by the darkness , many wounds are received on both sides ; several missiles , are thrown from the engines .
<start> At Marcus Antonius et Gaius Trebonius legati , quibus hae partes ad defendendum obvenerant , qua ex parte nostros premi intellexerant , his auxilio ex ulterioribus castellis deductos summittebant . <end>$$But Marcus Antonius , and Caius Trebonius , the lieutenants , to whom the defense of these parts had been allotted , draughted troops from the redoubts which were more remote , and sent them to aid our troops , in whatever direction they understood that they were hard pressed .
<start> Dum longius ab munitione aberant Galli , plus multitudine telorum proficiebant ; posteaquam propius successerunt , aut se stimulis inopinantes induebant aut in scrobes delati transfodiebantur aut ex vallo ac turribus traiecti pilis muralibus interibant . <end>$$While the Gauls were at a distance from the fortification , they did more execution , owing to the immense number of their weapons : after they came nearer , they either unawares empaled themselves on the spurs , or were pierced by the mural darts from the ramparts and towers , and thus perished .
<start> Multis undique vulneribus acceptis nulla munitione perrupta , cum lux appeteret , veriti ne ab latere aperto ex superioribus castris eruptione circumvenirentur , se ad suos receperunt . <end>$$After receiving many wounds on all sides , and having forced no part of the works , when day drew nigh , fearing lest they should be surrounded by a sally made from the higher camp on the exposed flank , they retreated to their countrymen .
<start> At interiores , dum ea quae a Vercingetorige ad eruptionem praeparata erant proferunt , priores fossas explent , diutius in his rebus administrandis morati prius suos discessisse cognoverunt , quam munitionibus appropinquarent . <end>$$But those within , while they bring forward those things which had been prepared by Vercingetorix for a sally , fill up the nearest trenches ; having delayed a long time in executing these movements , they learned the retreat of their countrymen before they drew nigh to the fortifications .
<start> Ita re infecta in oppidum reverterunt . <end>$$Thus they returned to the town without accomplishing their object .
<start> Bis magno cum detrimento repulsi Galli quid agant consulunt ; locorum peritos adhibent : ex his superiorum castrorum situs munitionesque cognoscunt . <end>$$The Gauls , having been twice repulsed with great loss , consult what they should do ; they avail themselves of the information of those who were well acquainted with the country ; from them they ascertain the position and fortification of the upper camp .
<start> Erat a septentrionibus collis , quem propter magnitudinem circuitus opere circumplecti non potuerant nostri : necessario paene iniquo loco et leniter declivi castra fecerunt . <end>$$There was , on the north side , a hill , which our men could not include in their works , on account of the extent of the circuit , and had necessarily made their camp in ground almost disadvantageous , and pretty steep .
<start> Haec Gaius Antistius Reginus et Gaius Caninius Rebilus legati cum duabus legionibus obtinebant . <end>$$Caius Antistius Reginus , and Caius Caninius Rebilus , two of the lieutenants , with two legions , were in possession of this camp .
<start> Cognitis per exploratores regionibus duces hostium LX milia ex omni numero deligunt earum civitatum quae maximam virtutis opinionem habebant ; quid quoque pacto agi placeat occulte inter se constituunt ; adeundi tempus definiunt , cum meridies esse videatur . <end>$$The leaders of the enemy , having reconnoitered the country by their scouts , select from the entire army sixty thousand men , belonging to those states , which bear the highest character for courage ; they privately arrange among themselves what they wished to be done , and in what manner ; they decide that the attack should take place when it should seem to be noon .
<start> His copiis Vercassivellaunum Arvernum , unum ex quattuor ducibus , propinquum Vercingetorigis , praeficiunt . <end>$$They appoint over their forces Vergasillaunus , the Arvernian , one of the four generals , and a near relative of Vercingetorix .
<start> Ille ex castris prima vigilia egressus prope confecto sub lucem itinere post montem se occultavit militesque ex nocturno labore sese reficere iussit . <end>$$He , having issued from the camp at the first watch , and having almost completed his march a little before the dawn , hid himself behind the mountain , and ordered his soldiers to refresh themselves after their labor during the night .
<start> Cum iam meridies appropinquare videretur , ad ea castra quae supra demonstravimus contendit ; eodemque tempore equitatus ad campestres munitiones accedere et reliquae copiae pro castris sese ostendere coeperunt . <end>$$When noon now seemed to draw nigh , he marched hastily against that camp which we have mentioned before ; and , at the same time , the cavalry began to approach the fortifications in the plain , and the rest of the forces to make a demonstration in front of the camp .
<start> Vercingetorix ex arce Alesiae suos conspicatus ex oppido egreditur ; crates , longurios , musculos , falces reliquaque quae eruptionis causa paraverat profert . <end>$$Vercingetorix , having beheld his countrymen from the citadel of Alesia , issues forth from the town ; he brings forth from the camp long hooks , movable pent-houses , mural hooks , and other things , which he had prepared for the purpose of making a sally .
<start> Pugnatur uno tempore omnibus locis , atque omnia temptantur : quae minime visa pars firma est , huc concurritur . <end>$$They flocked to whatever part of the works seemed weakest .
<start> Romanorum manus tantis munitionibus distinetur nec facile pluribus locis occurrit . <end>$$The army of the Romans is distributed along their extensive lines , and with difficulty meets the enemy in every quarter .
<start> Caesar idoneum locum nactus quid quaque ex parte geratur cognoscit ; laborantibus summittit . <end>$$Caesar , having selected a commanding situation , sees distinctly whatever is going on in every quarter , and sends assistance to his troops when hard pressed .
<start> Maxime ad superiores munitiones laboratur , quo Vercassivellaunum missum demonstravimus . <end>$$The least elevation of ground , added to a declivity , exercises a momentous influence .
<start> Alii tela coniciunt , alii testudine facta subeunt ; defatigatis in vicem integri succedunt . <end>$$The earth , heaped up by all against the fortifications , gives the means of ascent to the Gauls , and covers those works which the Romans had concealed in the ground .
<start> His rebus cognitis Caesar Labienum cum cohortibus sex subsidio laborantibus mittit : imperat , si sustinere non posset , deductis cohortibus eruptione pugnaret ; id nisi necessario ne faciat . <end>$$Caesar , on observing these movements , sends Labienus with six cohorts to relieve his distressed soldiers : he orders him , if he should be unable to withstand them , to draw off the cohorts and make a sally ; but not to do this except through necessity .
<start> Ipse adit reliquos , cohortatur ne labori succumbant ; omnium superiorum dimicationum fructum in eo die atque hora docet consistere . <end>$$He himself goes to the rest , and exhorts them not to succumb to the toil ; he shows them that the fruits of all former engagements depend on that day and hour .
<start> Interiores desperatis campestribus locis propter magnitudinem munitionum loca praerupta ex ascensu temptant : huc ea quae paraverant conferunt Multitudine telorum ex turribus propugnantes deturbant , aggere et cratibus fossas explent , falcibus vallum ac loricam rescindunt . <end>$$The Gauls within , despairing of forcing the fortifications in the plains on account of the greatness of the works , attempt the places precipitous in ascent : hither they bring the engines which they had prepared ; by the immense number of their missiles they dislodge the defenders from the turrets : they fill the ditches with clay and hurdles , then clear the way ; they tear down the rampart and breast-work with hooks .
<start> Mittit primo Brutum adulescentem cum cohortibus Caesar , post cum aliis Gaium Fabium legatum ; postremo ipse , cum vehementius pugnaretur , integros subsidio adducit . <end>$$Caesar sends at first young Brutus , with six cohorts , and afterward Caius Fabius , his lieutenant , with seven others : finally , as they fought more obstinately , he leads up fresh men to the assistance of his soldiers .
<start> Restituto proelio ac repulsis hostibus eo quo Labienum miserat contendit ; cohortes quattuor ex proximo castello deducit , equitum partem sequi , partem circumire exteriores munitiones et ab tergo hostes adoriri iubet . <end>$$After renewing the action , and repulsing the enemy , he marches in the direction in which he had sent Labienus , drafts four cohorts from the nearest redoubt , and orders part of the cavalry to follow him , and part to make the circuit of the external fortifications and attack the enemy in the rear .
<start> Labienus , postquam neque aggeres neque fossae vim hostium sustinere poterant , coactis una XL cohortibus , quas ex proximis praesidus deductas fors obtulit , Caesarem per nuntios facit certiorem quid faciendum existimet . <end>$$Labienus , when neither the ramparts or ditches could check the onset of the enemy , informs Caesar by messengers of what he intended to do .
<start> Accelerat Caesar , ut proelio intersit . <end>$$Caesar hastens to share in the action .
<start> Eius adventu ex colore vestitus cognito , quo insigni in proeliis uti consuerat , turmisque equitum et cohortibus visis quas se sequi iusserat , ut de locis superioribus haec declivia et devexa cernebantur , hostes proelium committunt . <end>$$His arrival being known from the color of his robe , and the troops of cavalry , and the cohorts which he had ordered to follow him being seen , as these low and sloping grounds were plainly visible from the eminences , the enemy join battle .
<start> Vtrimque clamore sublato excipit rursus ex vallo atque omnibus munitionibus clamor . <end>$$A shout being raised by both sides , it was succeeded by a general shout along the ramparts and whole line of fortifications .
<start> Nostri omissis pilis gladiis rem gerunt Repente post tergum equitatus cernitur ; cohortes aliae appropinquant . <end>$$Our troops , laying aside their javelins , carry on the engagement with their swords .
<start> Hostes terga vertunt ; fugientibus equites occurrunt Fit magna caedes Sedulius , dux et princeps Lemovicum , occiditur ; Vercassivellaunus Arvernus vivus in fuga comprehenditur ; signa militaria septuaginta quattuor ad Caesarem referuntur : pauci ex tanto numero se incolumes in castra recipiunt . <end>$$The cavalry is suddenly seen in the rear of the Gauls ; the other cohorts advance rapidly ; the enemy turn their backs ; the cavalry intercept them in their flight , and a great slaughter ensues .
<start> De media nocte missus equitatus novissimum agmen consequitur : magnus numerus capitur atque interficitur ; reliqui ex fuga in civitates discedunt . <end>$$Immediately after midnight , the cavalry are sent out and overtake the rear , a great number are taken or cut to pieces , the rest by flight escape in different directions to their respective states .
<start> Postero die Vercingetorix concilio convocato id bellum se suscepisse non suarum necessitatium , sed communis libertatis causa demonstrat , et quoniam sit fortunae cedendum , ad utramque rem se illis offerre , seu morte sua Romanis satisfacere seu vivum tradere velint . <end>$$Vercingetorix , having convened a council the following day , declares , That he had undertaken that war , not on account of his own exigences , but on account of the general freedom ; and since he must yield to fortune , he offered himself to them for either purpose , whether they should wish to atone to the Romans by his death , or surrender him alive .
<start> Mittuntur de his rebus ad Caesarem legati . <end>$$Embassadors are sent to Caesar on this subject .
<start> Ipse in munitione pro castris consedit : eo duces producuntur ; Vercingetorix deditur , arma proiciuntur . <end>$$They surrender Vercingetorix , and lay down their arms .
<start> Reservatis Aeduis atque Arvernis , si per eos civitates reciperare posset , ex reliquis captivis toto exercitui capita singula praedae nomine distribuit . <end>$$Reserving the Aedui and Arverni , if he could gain over , through their influence , their respective states , he distributes one of the remaining captives to each soldier , throughout the entire army , as plunder .
<start> His rebus confectis in Aeduos proficiscitur ; civitatem recipit . <end>$$After making these arrangements , he marches into the Aedui , and recovers that state .
<start> Eo legati ab Arvernis missi quae imperaret se facturos pollicentur . <end>$$To this place embassadors are sent by the Arveni , who promise that they will execute his commands .
<start> Imperat magnum numerum obsidum . <end>$$He demands a great number of hostages .
<start> Legiones in hiberna mittit Captivorum circiter viginti milia Aeduis Arvernisque reddit Titum Labienum duabus cum legionibus et equitatu in Sequanos proficisci iubet : huic Marcum Sempronium Rutilum attribuit Gaium Fabium legatum et Lucium Minucium Basilum cum legionibus duabus in Remis collocat , ne quam ab finitimis Bellovacis calamitatem accipiant . <end>$$He sends the legions to winter-quarters ; he restores about twenty thousand captives to the Aedui and Arverni ; he orders Titus Labienus to march into the Sequani with two legions and the cavalry , and to him he attaches Marcus Sempronius Rutilus ; he places Caius Fabius , and Lucius Minucius Basilus , with two legions in the country of the Remi , lest they should sustain any loss from the Bellovaci in their neighborhood .
<start> Gaium Antistium Reginum in Ambivaretos , Titum Sextium in Bituriges , Gaium Caninium Rebilum in Rutenos cum singulis legionibus mittit . <end>$$He sends Caius Antistius Reginus into the Ambivareti , Titus Sextius into the territories of the Bituriges , and Caius Caninius Rebilus into those of the Ruteni , with one legion each .
<start> Quintum Tullium Ciceronem et Publium Sulpicium Cabilloni et Matiscone in Aeduis ad Ararim rei frumentariae causa collocat . <end>$$He stations Quintus Tullius Cicero , and Publius Sulpicius among the Aedui at Cabillo and Matisco on the Saone , to procure supplies of corn .
<start> Ipse Bibracte hiemare constituit . <end>$$He himself determines to winter at Bibracte .
<start> His litteris cognitis Romae dierum viginti supplicatio redditur . <end>$$A supplication of twenty-days is decreed by the senate at Rome , on learning these successes from Caesar's dispatches .
<start> Litteris Gaius Caesaris consulibus redditis aegre ab his impetratum est summa tribunorum plebis contentione , ut in senatu recitarentur ; ut vero ex litteris ad senatum referretur , impetrari non potuit . <end>$$<start> When Caesar's letter was delivered to the consuls , they were with great difficulty , and a hard struggle of the tribunes , prevailed on to suffer it to be read in the senate ; but the tribunes could not prevail , that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the letter . <end>
<start> Referunt consules de re publica in civitate . <end>$$<start> The consuls put the question on the regulation of the state . <end>
<start> Incitat Lucius Lentulus consul senatu rei publicae se non defuturum pollicetur , si audacter ac fortiter sententias dicere velint ; sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam sequantur , ut superioribus fecerint temporibus , se sibi consilium capturum neque senatus auctoritati obtemperaturum : habere se quoque ad Caesaris gratiam atque amicitiam receptum . <end>$$<start> Lucius Lentulus the consul promises that he will not fail the senate and republic , if they declared their sentiments boldly and resolutely , but if they turned their regard to Caesar , and courted his favor , as they did on former occasions , he would adopt a plan for himself , and not submit to the authority of the senate : that he too had a means of regaining Caesar's favor and friendship . <end>
<start> In eandem sententiam loquitur Scipio : Pompeio esse in animo rei publicae non deesse , si senatus sequatur ; si cunctetur atque agat lenius , nequiquam eius auxilium , si postea velit , senatum imploraturum . <end>$$<start> Scipio spoke to the same purport , that it was Pompey's intention not to abandon the republic , if the senate would support him ; but if they should hesitate and act without energy , they would in vain implore his aid , if they should require it hereafter . <end>
<start> Haec Scipionis oratio , quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque aberat , ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur . <end>$$<start> This speech of Scipio's , as the senate was convened in the city , and Pompey was near at hand , seemed to have fallen from the lips of Pompey himself . <end>
<start> Dixerat aliquis leniorem sententiam , ut primo Marcus Marcellus , ingressus in eam orationem , non oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri , quam dilectus tota Italia habiti et exercitus conscripti essent , quo praesidio tuto et libere senatus , quae vellet , decernere auderet ; ut Marcus Calidius , qui censebat , ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficieceretur , ne qua esset armorum causa : timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus , ne ad eius periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur ; ut Marcus Rufus , qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus sequebatur . <end>$$<start> Some delivered their sentiments with more moderation , as Marcellus first , who in the beginning of his speech , said , that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter , till levies were made throughout all Italy , and armies raised under whose protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as they thought proper ; as Marcus Calidius afterward , who was of opinion , that Pompey should set out for his province , that there might be no cause for arms ; that Caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced from him , that Pompey was retaining those troops , and keeping them near the city to do him injury : as Marcus Rufus , who followed Calidius almost word for word . <end>
<start> Hi omnes convicio Lucius Lentuli consulis correpti exagitabantur . <end>$$<start> They were all harshly rebuked by Lentulus , who peremptorily refused to propose Calidius's motion . <end>
<start> Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnina negavit . <end>$$<start> Marcellus , overawed by his reproofs , retracted his opinion . <end>
<start> Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia discessit Sic vocibus consulis , terrore praesentis exercitus , minis amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis sententiam sequuntur : uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat ; si non faciat , eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri . <end>$$<start> Thus most of the senate , intimidated by the expressions of the consul , by the fears of a present army , and the threats of Pompey's friends , unwillingly and reluctantly adopted Scipio's opinion , that Caesar should disband his army by a certain day , and should he not do so , he should he considered as acting against the state . <end>
<start> Intercedit Marcus Antonius , Quintus Cassius , tribuni plebis . <end>$$<start> Marcus Antonius , and Quintus Cassius , tribunes of the people , interposed . <end>
<start> Refertur confestim de intersessione tribunorum . <end>$$<start> The question was immediately put on their interposition . <end>
<start> Dicuntur sententiae graves ; ut quisque acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit , ita quam maxime ab inimicis Caesaris collaudatur . <end>$$<start> Violent opinions were expressed ; whoever spoke with the greatest acrimony and cruelty was most highly commended by Caesar's enemies . <end>
<start> Misso ad vesperum senatu omnes , qui sunt eius ordinis , a Pompeio evocantur . <end>$$<start> The senate having broken up in the evening , all who belonged to that order were summoned by Pompey . <end>
<start> Laudat promptos Pompeius atque in posterum confirmat , segniores castigat atque incitat . <end>$$<start> Many veterans , from all parts , who had served in Pompey's armies , were invited to his standard by the hopes of rewards and promotions . <end>
<start> Multi undique ex veteribus Pompei exercitibus spe praemiorum atque ordinum evocantur , multi ex duabus legionibus , quae sunt traditae a Caesare , arcessuntur . <end>$$<start> Several officers belonging to the two legions , which had been delivered up by Caesar , were sent for . <end>
<start> Omnes amici consulum , necessarii Pompei atque eorum , qui veteres inimicitias cum Caesare gerebant , in senatum coguntur ; quorum vocibus et concursu terrentur infirmiores , dubii confirmantur , plerisque vero libere decernendi potestas eripitur . <end>$$<start> By their concourse and declarations the timid were awed , the irresolute confirmed , and the greater part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments with freedom . <end>
<start> Pollicetur Lucius Piso censor sese iturum ad Caesarem , item Lucius Roscius praetor , qui de his rebus eum doceant : sex dies ad eam rem conficiendam spatii postulant . <end>$$<start> Lucius Piso , the censor , offered to go to Caesar : as did likewise Lucius Roscius , the praetor , to inform him of these affairs , and require only six days' time to finish the business . <end>
<start> Omnibus his resistitur , omnibusque oratio consulis , Scipionis , Catonis opponitur . <end>$$<start> All these proposals were rejected , and opposition made to them all , in the speeches of the consul , Scipio , and Cato . <end>
<start> Lentulus aeris alieni magnitudine et spe exercitus ac provinciarum et regum appellandorum largitionibus movetur , seque alterum fore Sullam inter suos gloriatur , ad quem summa imperii redeat . <end>$$<start> Similar hopes of a province and armies , which he expected to share with Pompey on account of his connection with him , urged on Scipio ; and moreover he was influenced by the fear of being called to trial , and the adulation and an ostentatious display of himself and his friends in power , who at that time had great influence in the republic , and courts of judicature . <end>
<start> Scipionem eadem spes provinciae atque exercituum impellit , quos se pro necessitudine partiturum cum Pompeio arbitratur , simul iudiciorum metus , adulatio atque ostentatia sui et potentium , qui in re publica iudiciisque tum plurimum pollebant . <end>$$<start> Pompey himself , incited by Caesar's enemies , because he was unwilling that any person should bear an equal degree of dignity , had wholly alienated himself from Caesar's friendship , and procured a reconciliation with their common enemies ; the greatest part of whom he had himself brought upon Caesar during his affinity with him . <end>
<start> His de causis aguntur omnia raptim atque turbate Nec docendi Caesaris propinquis eius spatium datur , nec tribunis plebis sui periculi deprecandi neque etiam extremi iuris intercessione retinendi , quod Lucius Sulla reliquerat , facultas tribuitur , sed de sua salute septimo die cogitare coguntur , quod illi turbulentissimi superioribus temporibus tribuni plebis octavo denique mense suarum actionum respicere ac timere consuerant . <end>$$<start> For these reasons every thing was done in a hasty and disorderly manner , and neither was time given to Caesar's relations to inform him of the state of affairs nor liberty to the tribunes of the people to deprecate their own danger , nor even to retain the last privilege , which Sylla had left them , the interposing their authority ; but on the seventh day they were obliged to think of their own safety , which the most turbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to , nor to fear being called to an account for their actions , till the eighth month . <end>
<start> Decurritur ad illud extremum atque ultimum senatus consultum , quo nisi paene in ipso urbis incendio atque in desperatione omnium salutis sceleratorum audacia numquam ante descensum est : dent operam consules , praetores , tribuni plebis , quique pro consulibus sint ad urbem , ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat . <end>$$<start> Recourse is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate (which was never resorted to even by daring proposers except when the city was in danger of being set on fire , or when the public safety was despaired of) . <end>
<start> Haec senatusconsulto perscribuntur ad VII Id Ian Itaque V primis diebus , quibus haberi senatus potuit , qua ex die consulatum iniit Lentulus , biduo excepto comitiali et de imperio Caesaris et de amplissimis viris , tribunis plebis , gravissime acerbissimeque decernitur . <end>$$<start> That the consuls , praetors , tribunes of the people , and proconsuls in the city , should take care that the state received no injury . <end>
<start> Is eo tempore erat Ravennae exspectabatque suis lenissimis postulatis responsa , si qua hominum aequitate res ad otium deduci posset . <end>$$<start> The latter immediately made their escape from the city , and withdrew to Caesar , who was then at Ravenna , awaiting an answer to his moderate demands ; to see if matters could be brought to a peaceful termination by any equitable act on the part of his enemies . <end>
<start> Proximis diebus habetur extra urbem senatus . <end>$$<start> During the succeeding days the senate is convened outside the city . <end>
<start> Statim de reliquis rebus ad senatum refertur : tota Italia delectus habeatur ; Faustus Sulla propere in Mauretaniam mittatur ; pecunia uti ex aerario Pompeio detur . <end>$$<start> He applauded the courage and firmness of the senate , acquainted them with his force , and told them that he had ten legions ready ; that he was moreover informed and assured that Caesar's soldiers were disaffected , and that he could not persuade them to defend or even follow him . <end>
<start> De reliquis rebus senatusconsulta perscribuntur . <end>$$<start> But Marcellus said that he would not allow this motion for the present . <end>
<start> Provinciae privatis decernuntur duae consulares , reliquae praetoriae . <end>$$<start> Philip , one of the tribunes , stopped the appointment of Sylla ; the resolutions respecting the other matters passed . <end>
<start> Scipioni obvenit Syria , Lucius Domitio Gallia ; Philippus et Cotta privato consilio praetereuntur , neque eorum sortes deiciuntur . <end>$$<start> The provinces , two of which were consular , the remainder praetorian , were decreed to private persons ; Scipio got Syria , Lucius Domitius Gaul : Philip and Marcellus were omitted , from a private motive , and their lots were not even admitted . <end>
<start> Neque exspectant , quod superioribus annis acciderat , ut de eorum imperio ad popullim feratur paludatique votis nuncupatis exeant . <end>$$<start> Both the consuls leave the city , and private men had lictors in the city and capital , contrary to all precedents of former times . <end>
<start> Consules , quod ante id tempus accidit nunquam , ex urbe proficiscuntur , lictoresque habent in urbe et Capitolio privati contra omnia vetustatis exempla . <end>$$<start> Levies were made throughout Italy , arms demanded , and money exacted from the municipal towns , and violently taken from the temples . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar apud milites contionatur Omnium temporum iniurias inimicorum in se commemorat ; a quibus deductum ac depravatum Pompeium queritur invidia atque obtrectatione laudis suae , cuius ipse honori et dignitati semper faverit adiutorque fuerit . <end>$$<start> These things being made known to Caesar , he harangued his soldiers ; he reminded them of the wrongs done to him at all times by his enemies , and complained that Pompey had been alienated from him and led astray by them through envy and a malicious opposition to his glory , though he had always favored and promoted Pompey's honor and dignity . <end>

<start> Is reliquo sermone confecto , cuius rei causa venerat , habere se a Pompeio ad eum privati officii mandata demonstrat : velle Pompeium se Caesari purgatum , ne ea , quae rei publicae causa egerit , in suam contumeliam vertat Semper se rei publicae commoda privatis necessitudinibus habuisse potiora Caesarem quoque pro sua dignitate debere et studium et iracundiam suam rei publicae dimittere neque adeo graviter irasci inimicis , ut , cum illis nocere se speret , rei publicae noceat . <end>$$<start> He , after concluding the rest of his speech , and stating for what purpose he had come , told Caesar that he had commands of a private nature for him from Pompey ; that Pompey wished to clear himself to Caesar , lest he should impute those actions which he did for the republic , to a design of affronting him ; that he had ever preferred the interest of the state to his own private connections ; that Caesar , too , for his own honor , ought to sacrifice his desires and resentment to the public good , and not vent his anger so violently against his enemies , lest in his hopes of injuring them , he should injure the republic . <end>
<start> Pauca eiusdem generis addit cum excusatione Pompei coniuncta . <end>$$<start> He spoke a few words to the same purport from himself , in addition to Pompey's apology . <end>
<start> Eadem fere atque eisdem verbis praetor Roscius agit cum Caesare sibique Pompeium commemorasse demonstrat . <end>$$<start> Roscius , the praetor , conferred with Caesar almost in the same words , and on the same subject , and declared that Pompey had empowered him to do so . <end>
<start> Quae res etsi nihil ad levandas iniurias pertinere videbantur , tamen idoneos nactus homines , per quos ea , quae vellet , ad eum perferrentur , petit ab utroque , quoniam Pompei mandata ad se detulerint , ne graventur sua quoque ad eum postulata deferre , si parvo labore magnas controversias tollere atque omnem Italiam metu liberare possint . <end>$$<start> Though these things seemed to have no tendency toward redressing his injuries , yet having got proper persons by whom he could communicate his wishes to Pompey ; he required of them both , that , as they had conveyed Pompey's demands to him , they should not refuse to convey his demands to Pompey ; if by so little trouble they could terminate a great dispute , and liberate all Italy from her fears . <end>
<start> Sibi semper primam rei publicae fuisse dignitatem vitaque potiorem Doluisse se , quod populi Romani beneficium sibi per contumeliam ab inimicis extorqueretur , ereptoque semenstri imperio in urbem retraheretur , cuius absentis rationem haberi proximis comitiis populus iussisset Tamen hanc iacturam honoris sui rei publicae causa aequo animo tulisse ; cum litteras ad senatum miserit , ut omnes ab exercitibus discederent , ne id quidem impetravisse . <end>$$<start> That the honor of the republic had ever been his first object , and dearer to him than life ; that he was chagrined , that the favor of the Roman people was wrested from him by the injurious reports of his enemies ; that he was deprived of a half-year's command , and dragged back to the city , though the people had ordered that regard should be paid to his suit for the consulate at the next election , though he was not present ; that , however , he had patiently submitted to this loss of honor , for the sake of the republic ; that when he wrote letters to the senate , requiring that all persons should resign the command of their armies , he did not obtain even that request ; that levies were made throughout Italy ; that the two legions which had been taken from him , under the pretense of the Parthian war , were kept at home , and that the state was in arms . <end>
<start> Tota Italia delectus haberi , retineri legiones II , quae ab se simulatione Parthici belli sint abductae , civitatem esse in armis . <end>$$<start> To what did all these things tend , unless to his ruin ? But , nevertheless , he was ready to condescend to any terms , and to endure every thing for the sake of the republic . <end>
<start> Quonam haec omnia nisi ad suam perniciem pertinere ? Sed tamen ad omnia se descendere paratum atque omnia pati rei publicae causa Proficiscatur Pompeius in suas provincias , ipsi exercitus dimittant , discedant in Italia omnes ab armis , metus e civitate tollatur , libera comitia atque omnis res publica senatui populoque Romano permittatur . <end>$$<start> Let Pompey go to his own province ; let them both disband their armies ; let all persons in Italy lay down their arms ; let all fears be removed from the city ; let free elections , and the whole republic be resigned to the direction of the senate and Roman people . <end>
<start> Haec quo facilius certisque condicionibus fiant et iureiurando sanciantur , aut ipse propius accedat aut se patiatur accedere : fore uti per colloquia omnes controversiae componantur . <end>$$<start> That these things might be the more easily performed , and conditions secured and confirmed by oath , either let Pompey come to Caesar , or allow Caesar to go to him ; it might be that all their disputes would be settled by an interview . <end>
<start> Acceptis mandatis Roscius cum Lucius Caesare Capuam pervenit ibique consules Pompeiumque invenit ; postulata Caesaris renuntiat . <end>$$<start> Roscius and Lucius Caesar , having received this message , went to Capua , where they met the consuls and Pompey , and declared to them Caesar's terms . <end>
<start> Illi deliberata re respondent scriptaque ad eum mandata per eos remittunt ; quorum haec erat summa : Caesar in Galliam reverteretur , Arimino excederet , exercitus dimitteret ; quae si fecisset , Pompeium in Hispanias iturum . <end>$$<start> Having deliberated on the matter , they replied , and sent written proposals to him by the same persons , the purport of which was , that Caesar should return into Gaul , leave Ariminum , and disband his army : if he complied with this , that Pompey would go to Spain . <end>
<start> Interea , quoad fides esset data Caesarem facturum , quae polliceretur , non intermissuros consules Pompeiumque delectus . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , until security was given that Caesar would perform his promises , that the consuls and Pompey would not give over their levies . <end>
<start> Erat iniqua condicio postulare , ut Caesar Arimino excederet atque in provinciam reverteretur , ipsum et provincias et legiones alienas tenere ; exercitum Caesaris velle dimitti , delectus habere ; polliceri se in provineiam iturum neque , ante quem diem iturus sit , definire , ut , si peracto consulatu Caesar profectus esset , nulla tamen mendacii religione obstrictus videretur ; tempus vero colloquio non dare neque accessurum polliceri magnam pacis desperationem afferebat . <end>$$<start> It was not an equitable proposal , to require that Caesar should quit Ariminum and return to his province ; but that he Pompey should himself retain his province and the legions that belonged to another , and desire that Caesar's army should be disbanded , while he himself was making new levies : and that he should merely promise to go to his province , without naming the day on which he would set out ; so that if he should not set out till after Caesar's consulate expired , yet he would not appear bound by any religious scruples about asserting a falsehood . <end>
<start> Interea certior factus Iguium Thermum praetorem cohortibus V tenere , oppidum munire , omniumque esse Iguvinorum optimam erga se voluntatem , Curionem cum tribus cohortibus , quas Pisauri et Arimini habebat , mittit . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , being informed that Thermus the praetor was in possession of Iguvium , with five cohorts , and was fortifying the town , but that the affections of all the inhabitants were very well inclined toward himself , he detached Curio with three cohorts , which he had at Ariminum and Pisaurus . <end>

<start> Quibus rebus cognitis confisus municipiorum voluntatibus Caesar cohortes legionis XIII ex praesidiis deducit Auximumque proficiscitur ; quod oppidum Attius cohortibus introductis tenebat delectumque toto Piceno circummissis senatoribus habebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having received an account of this , and relying on the affections of the municipal towns , drafted all the cohorts of the thirteenth legion from the garrison , and set out for Auximum , a town into which Attius had brought his cohorts , and of which he had taken possession , and from which he had sent senators round about the country of Picenum , to raise new levies . <end>
<start> Adventu Caesaris cognito decuriones Auximi ad Attium Varum frequentes conveniunt ; docent sui iudicii rem non esse ; neque se neque reliquos municipes pati posse Gaius Caesarem imperatorem , bene de re publica meritum , tantis rebus gestis oppido moenibusque prohiberi ; proinde habeat rationem posteritatis et periculi sui . <end>$$<start> Upon news of Caesar's approach , the senate of Auximum went in a body to Attius Varus ; and told him that it was not a subject for them to determine upon : yet neither they , nor the rest of the freemen would suffer Caius Caesar , a general , who had merited so well of the republic , after performing such great achievements , to be excluded from their town and walls ; wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion of posterity , and his own danger . <end>
<start> Quorum oratione permotus Varus praesidium , quod introduxerat , ex oppido educit ac profugit . <end>$$<start> Alarmed at this declaration , Attius Varus drew out of the town the garrison which he had introduced , and fled . <end>
<start> At Caesar milites Attianos collaudat , Pupium dimittit , Auximatibus agit gratias seque eorum facti memorem fore pollicetur . <end>$$<start> But Caesar applauded the soldiers of Attius , set Pupius at liberty , returned thanks to the people of Auximum , and promised to be grateful for their conduct . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus Romam nuntiatis tantus repente terror invasit , ut cum Lentulus consul ad aperiendum aerarium venisset ad pecuniamque Pompeio ex senatusconsulto proferendam , protinus aperto sanctiore aerario ex urbe profugeret . <end>$$<start> Intelligence of this being brought to Rome , so great a panic spread on a sudden that when Lentulus , the consul , came to open the treasury , to deliver money to Pompey by the senate's decree , immediately on opening the hallowed door he fled from the city . <end>
<start> Caesar enim adventare iam iamque et adesse eius equites falso nuntiabantur . <end>$$<start> For it was falsely rumored that Caesar was approaching , and that his cavalry were already at the gates . <end>

<start> Ipse arcano cum paucis familiaribus suis colloquitur consiliumque fugae capere constituit . <end>$$<start> He held private conferences with a few of his most intimate friends , and determined on the design of fleeing . <end>
<start> Cum vultus Domiti cum oratione non consentiret , atque omnia trepidantius timidiusque ageret , quam superioribus diebus consuesset , multumque cum suis consiliandi causa secreto praeter consuetudinem colloqueretur , concilia conventusque hominum fugeret , res diutius tegi dissimularique non potuit . <end>$$<start> As Domitius's countenance did not agree with his words , and he did every thing with more confusion and fear than he had shown on the preceding days , and as he had several private meetings with his friends , contrary to his usual practice , in order to take their advice , and as he avoided all public councils and assemblies of the people , the truth could be no longer hid nor dissembled ; for Pompey had written back in answer , That he would not put matters to the last hazard ; that Domitius had retreated into the town of Corfinium without either his advice or consent . <end>
<start> Id ne fieri posset , obsidione atque oppidi circummunitione fiebat . <end>$$<start> But the blockade and works round the town prevented his escape . <end>
<start> Divulgato Domiti consilio milites , qui erant Corfinii , prima vesperi secessionem faciunt atque ita inter se per tribunos militum centurionesque atque honestissimos sui generis colloquuntur : obsideri se a Caesare , opera munitionesque prope esse perfectas ; ducem suum Domitium , cuius spe atque fiducia permanserint , proiectis omnibus fugae consilium capere : debere se suae salutis rationem habere . <end>$$<start> Domitius's design being noised abroad , the soldiers in Corfinium early in the evening began to mutiny , and held a conference with each other by their tribunes and centurions , and the most respectable among themselves : that they were besieged by Caesar ; that his works and fortifications were almost finished ; that their general , Domitius , on whose hopes and expectations they had confided , had thrown them off , and was meditating his own escape ; that they ought to provide for their own safety . <end>
<start> Ab his primo Marsi dissentire incipiunt eamque oppidi partem , quae munitissima videretur , occupant , tantaque inter eos dissensio exsistit , ut manum conserere atque armis dimicare conentur ; post paulo tamen internuntiis ultro citroque missis quae ignorabant , de Lucius Domiti fuga , cognoscunt . <end>$$<start> However , in a little time , by messengers sent from one side to the other , they were informed of Domitius's meditated flight , of which they were previously ignorant . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar , etsi magni interesse arbitrabatur quam primum oppido potiri cohortesque ad se in castra traducere , ne qua aut largitionibus aut animi confirmatione aut falsis nuntiis commutatio fieret voluntatis , quod saepe in bello parvis momentis magni casus intercederent , tamen veritus , ne militum introitu et nocturni temporis licentia oppidum diriperetur , eos , qui venerant , collaudat atque in oppidum dimittit , portas murosque adservari iubet . <end>$$<start> Upon intelligence of these matters , though Caesar thought it of great consequence to become master of the town as soon as possible , and to transfer the cohorts to his own camp , lest any change should be wrought on their inclinations by bribes , encouragement , or ficticious messages , because in war great events are often brought about by trifling circumstances ; yet , dreading lest the town should be plundered by the soldiers entering into it , and taking advantage of the darkness of the night , he commended the persons who came to him , and sent them back to the town , and ordered the gates and walls to be secured . <end>
<start> Ipse eis operibus , quae facere instituerat , milites disponit non certis spatiis intermissis , ut erat superiorum dierum consuetudo , sed perpetuis vigiliis stationibusque , ut contingant inter se atque omnem munitionem expleant ; tribunos militum et praefectos circummittit atque hortatur , non solum ab eruptionibus caveant , sed etiam singulorum hominum occultos exitus adservent . <end>$$<start> He disposed his soldiers on the works which he had begun , not at certain intervals , as was his practice before , but in one continued range of sentinels and stations , so that they touched each other , and formed a circle round the whole fortification ; he ordered the tribunes and general officers to ride round ; and exhorted them not only to be on their guard against sallies from the town , but also to watch that no single person should get out privately . <end>
<start> Neque vero tam remisso ac languido animo quisquam omnium fuit , qui ea nocte conquieverit . <end>$$<start> Nor was any man so negligent or drowsy as to sleep that night . <end>
<start> Tanta erat summae rerum exspectatio , ut alius in aliam partem mente atque animo traheretur , quid ipsis Corfiniensibus , quid Domitio , quid Lentulo , quid reliquis accideret , qui quosque eventus exciperent . <end>$$<start> To so great height was their expectation raised , that they were carried away , heart and soul , each to different objects , what would become of the Corfinians , what of Domitius , what of Lentulus , what of the rest ; what event would be the consequence of another . <end>
<start> Quarta vigilia circiter Lentulus Spinther de muro cum vigiliis custodibusque nostris colloquitur ; velle , si sibi fiat potestas , Caesarem convenire . <end>$$<start> About the fourth watch , Lentulus Spinther said to our sentinels and guards from the walls , that he desired to have an interview with Caesar , if permission were given him . <end>
<start> Facta potestate ex oppido mittitur , neque ab eo prius Domitiani milites discedunt , quam in conspectum Caesaris deducatur . <end>$$<start> Having obtained it , he was escorted out of town ; nor did the soldiers of Domitius leave him till they brought him into Caesar's presence . <end>
<start> Cum eo de salute sua agit , orat atque obsecrat , ut sibi parcat , veteremque amicitiam commemorat Caesarisque in se beneficia exponit ; quae erant maxima : quod per eum in collegium pontificum venerat , quod provinciam Hispaniam ex praetura habuerat , quod in petitione consulatus erat sublevatus . <end>$$<start> He pleaded with Caesar for his life , and entreated him to spare him , and reminded him of their former friendship ; and acknowledged that Caesar's favors to him were very great ; in that through his interest he had been admitted into the college of priests ; in that after his praetorship he had been appointed to the government of Spain ; in that he had been assisted by him in his suit for the consulate . <end>
<start> Cuius orationem Caesar interpellat : se non maleficii causa ex provincia egressum , sed uti se a contumeliis inimicorum defenderet , ut tribunos plebis in ea re ex civitate expulsos in suam dignitatem restitueret , ut se et populum Romanum factione paucorum oppressum in libertatem vindicaret . <end>$$<start> Caesar interrupted him in his speech , and told him , that he had not left his province to do mischief to any man , but to protect himself from the injuries of his enemies ; to restore to their dignity the tribunes of the people who had been driven out of the city on his account , and to assert his own liberty , and that of the Roman people , who were oppressed by a few factious men . <end>
<start> Cuius oratione confirmatus Lentulus , ut in oppidum reverti liceat , petit : quod de sua salute impetraverit , fore etiam reliquis ad suam spem solatio ; adeo esse perterritos nonnullos , ut suae vitae durius consulere cogantur . <end>$$<start> Encouraged by this address , Lentulus begged leave to return to the town , that the security which he had obtained for himself might be an encouragement to the rest to hope for theirs ; saying that some were so terrified that they were induced to make desperate attempts on their own lives . <end>
<start> Facta potestate discedit . <end>$$<start> Leave being granted him , he departed . <end>
<start> Caesar , ubi luxit , omnes senatores senatorumque liberos , tribunos militum equitesque Romanos ad se produci iubet . <end>$$<start> When day appeared , Caesar ordered all the senators and their children , the tribunes of the soldiers , and the Roman knights to be brought before him . <end>
<start> Quintilius Varus quaestor , Lucius Rubrius ; praeterea filius Domiti aliique complures adulescentes et magnus numerus equitum Romanorum et decurionum , quos ex municipiis Domitius evocaverat . <end>$$<start> When they were brought before him he protected them from the insolence and taunts of the soldiers ; told them in few words that they had not made him a grateful return , on their part , for his very extraordinary kindness to them , and dismissed them all in safety . <end>
<start> Hos omnes productos a contumeliis militum conviciisque prohibet ; pauca apud eos loquitur , queritur quod sibi a parte eorum gratia relata non sit pro suis in eos maximis beneficiis ; dimittit omnes incolumes . <end>$$<start> Sixty sestertia , which Domitius had brought with him and lodged in the public treasury , being brought to Caesar by the magistrates of Corfinium , he gave them back to Domitius , that he might not appear more moderate with respect to the life of men than in money matters , though he knew that it was public money , and had been given by Pompey to pay his army . <end>
<start> Milites Domitianos sacramentum apud se dicere iubet atque eo die castra movet iustumque iter conficit VII omnino dies ad Corfinium commoratus , et per fines Marrucinorum , Frentranorum , Larinatium in Apuliam pervenit . <end>$$<start> He staid only seven days before Corfinium , and marched into Apulia through the country of the Marrucinians , Frentanian's and Larinates . <end>
<start> Pompeius his rebus cognitis , quae erant ad Corfinium gestae , Luceria proficiscitur Canusium atque inde Brundisium . <end>$$<start> Pompey , being informed of what had passed at Corfinium , marches from Luceria to Canusium , and thence to Brundusium . <end>
<start> Copias undique omnes ex novis dilectibus ad se cogi iubet ; servos , pastores armat atque eis equos attribuit ; ex his circiter CCC equites conficit . <end>$$<start> He orders all the forces raised every where by the new levies to repair to him . <end>
<start> Lucius Manlius praetor Alba cum cohortibus sex profugit , Rutilius Lupus praetor Tarracina cum tribus ; quae procul equitatum Caesaris conspicatae , cui praeerat Vibius Curius , relicto praetore signa ad Curium transferunt atque ad eum transeunt . <end>$$<start> He gives arms to the slaves that attended the flocks , and appoints horses for them Of these he made up about three hundred horse . <end>
<start> Item reliquis itineribus nonnullae cohortes in agmen Caesaris , aliae in equites incidunt . <end>$$<start> Lucius , the praetor , fled from Alba , with six cohorts : Rutilus , Lupus , the praetor , from Tarracina , with three . <end>
<start> Quem Caesar ad eum remittit cum mandatis : quoniam ad id tempus facultas colloquendi non fuerit , atque ipse Brundisium sit venturus , interesse rei publicae et communis salutis se cum Pompeio colloqui ; neque vero idem profici longo itineris spatio , cum per alios condiciones ferantur , ac si coram de omnibus condicionibus disceptetur . <end>$$<start> Cneius Magius , from Cremona , engineer-general to Pompey , was taken prisoner on the road and brought to Caesar , but sent back by him to Pompey with this message : As hitherto he had not been allowed an interview , and was now on his march to him at Brundusium , that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and general safety that he should have an interview with Pompey ; and that the same advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the proposals were conveyed to them by others , as if terms were argued by them both in person . <end>
<start> His datis mandatis Brundisium cum legionibus VI pervenit , veteranis III et reliquis , quas ex novo dilectu confecerat atque in itinere compleverat ; Domitianas enim cohortes protinus a Corfinio in Siciliam miserat . <end>$$<start> Having delivered this message he marched to Brundusium with six legions , four of them veterans : the rest those which he had raised in the late levy and completed on his march , for he had sent all Domitius's cohorts immediately from Corfinium to Sicily . <end>
<start> Reperit consules Dyrrachium profectos cum magna parte exercitus , Pompeium remanere Brundisii cum cohortibus viginti ; neque certum inveniri poterat , obtinendine Brundisii causa ibi remansisset , quo facilius omne Hadriaticum mare ex ultimis Italiae partibus regionibusque Graeciae in potestate haberet atque ex utraque parte bellum administrare posset , an inopia navium ibi restitisset , veritusque ne ille Italiam dimittendam non existimaret , exitus administrationesque Brundisini portus impedire instituit . <end>$$<start> He discovered that the consuls were gone to Dyrrachium with a considerable part of the army , and that Pompey remained at Brundusium with twenty cohorts ; but could not find out , for a certainty , whether Pompey staid behind to keep possession of Brundusium , that he might the more easily command the whole Adriatic sea , with the extremities of Italy and the coast of Greece , and be able to conduct the war on either side of it , or whether he remained there for want of shipping ; and , being afraid that Pompey would come to the conclusion that he ought not to relinquish Italy , he determined to deprive him of the means of communication afforded by the harbor of Brundusium . <end>
<start> Quorum operum haec erat ratio Qua fauces erant angustissimae portus , moles atque aggerem ab utraque parte litoris iaciebat , quod his locis erat vadosum mare . <end>$$<start> The plan of his work was as follows : Where the mouth of the port was narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on either side , because in these places the sea was shallow . <end>
<start> Longius progressus , cum agger altiore aqua contineri non posset , rates duplices quoquo versus pedum XXX e regione molis collocabat . <end>$$<start> Having gone out so far that the mole could not be continued in the deep water , he fixed double floats , thirty feet on either side , before the mole . <end>
<start> Has quaternis ancoris ex IIII angulis destinabat , ne fluctibus moverentur . <end>$$<start> These he fastened with four anchors at the four corners , that they might not be carried away by the waves . <end>
<start> His perfectis collocatisque alias deinceps pari magnitudine rates iungebat . <end>$$<start> Having completed and secured them , he then joined to them other floats of equal size . <end>
<start> Has terra atque aggere integebat , ne aditus atque incursus ad defendendum impediretur A fronte atque ab utroque latere cratibus ac pluteis protegebat ; in quarta quaque earum turres binorum tabulatorum excitabat , quo commodius ab impetu navium incendiisque defenderet . <end>$$<start> These he covered over with earth and mold , that he might not be prevented from access to them to defend them , and in the front and on both sides he protected them with a parapet of wicker work ; and on every fourth one raised a turret , two stories high , to secure them the better from being attacked by the shipping and set on fire . <end>
<start> Contra haec Pompeius naves magnas onerarias , quas in portu Brundisino deprehenderat , adornabat Ibi turres cum ternis tabulatis erigebat easque multis tormentis et omni genere telorum completas ad opera Caesaris adpellebat , ut rates perrumperet atque opera disturbaret . <end>$$<start> To counteract this , Pompey fitted out large merchant ships , which he found in the harbor of Brundusium : on them he erected turrets three stories high , and , having furnished them with several engines and all sorts of weapons , drove them among Caesar's works , to break through the floats and interrupt the works ; thus there happened skirmishes every day at a distance with slings , arrows , and other weapons . <end>
<start> Sic cotidie utrimque eminus fundis , sagittis reliquisque telis pugnabatur . <end>$$<start> Caesar conducted matters as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not yet to be given up . <end>
<start> Atque haec Caesar ita administrabat , ut condiciones pacis dimittendas non existimaret ; ac tametsi magnopere admirabatur Magium , quem ad Pompeium cum mandatis miserat , ad se non remitti , atque ea res saepe temptata etsi impetus eius consiliaque tardabat , tamen omnibus rebus in eo perseverandum putabat . <end>$$<start> And though he was very much surprised that Magius , whom he had sent to Pompey with a message , was not sent back to him ; and though his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous prosecution of his plans , yet he thought that he ought by all means to persevere in the same line of conduct . <end>
<start> Cuius rei magnam partem laudis atque existimationis ad Libonem perventuram , si illo auctore atque agente ab armis sit discessum . <end>$$<start> He charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace , but , above all things , requires that he should be admitted to an interview with Pompey . <end>
<start> Ita saepius rem frustra temptatam Caesar aliquando dimittendam sibi iudicat et de bello agendum . <end>$$<start> Caesar therefore thought it time at length to give over the attempt which he had often made in vain , and act with energy in the war . <end>
<start> Prope dimidia parte operis a Caesare effecta diebusque in ea re consumptis VIIII naves a consulibus Dyrrachio remissae , quae priorem partem exercitus eo deportaverant , Brundisium revertuntur . <end>$$<start> When Caesar's works were nearly half finished , and after nine days were spent in them , the ships which had conveyed the first division of the army to Dyrrachium being sent back by the consuls , returned to Brundusium . <end>
<start> Pompeius sive operibus Caesaris permotus sive etiam quod ab initio Italia excedere constituerat , adventu navium profectionem parare incipit et , quo facilius impetum Caesaris tardaret , ne sub ipsa profectione milites oppidum irrumperent , portas obstruit , vicos plateasque inaedificat , fossas transversas viis praeducit atque ibi sudes stipitesque praeacutos defigit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , either frightened at Caesar's works or determined from the beginning to quit Italy , began to prepare for his departure on the arrival of the ships ; and the more effectually to retard Caesar's attack , lest his soldiers should force their way into the town at the moment of his departure , he stopped up the gates , built walls across the streets and avenues , sunk trenches across the ways , and in them fixed palisadoes and sharp stakes , which he made level with the ground by means of hurdles and clay . <end>
<start> Haec levibus cratibus terraque inaequat ; aditus autem atque itinera duo , quae extra murum ad portum ferebant , maximis defixis trabibus atque eis praeacutis praesepit . <end>$$<start> But he barricaded with large beams fastened in the ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads without the walls , which led to the port . <end>
<start> His paratis rebus milites silentio naves conscendere iubet , expeditos autem ex evocatis , sagittariis funditoribusque raros in muro turribusque disponit . <end>$$<start> After making these arrangements , he ordered his soldiers to go on board without noise , and disposed here and there , on the wall and turrets , some light-armed veterans , archers and slingers . <end>
<start> Hos certo signo revocare constituit , cum omnes milites naves conscendissent , atque eis expedito loco actuaria navigia relinquit . <end>$$<start> These he designed to call off by a certain signal , when all the soldiers were embarked , and left row-galleys for them in a secure place . <end>
<start> Brundisini Pompeianorum militum iniuriis atque ipsius Pompei contumeliis permoti Caesaris rebus favebant . <end>$$<start> The people of Brundusium , irritated by the insolence of Pompey's soldiers , and the insults received from Pompey himself , were in favor of Caesar's party . <end>
<start> Itaque cognita Pompei profectione concursantibus illis atque in ea re occupatis vulgo ex tectis significabant Per quos re cognita Caesar scalas parari militesque armari iubet , ne quam rei gerendae facultatem dimittat . <end>$$<start> Therefore , as soon as they were aware of Pompey's departure , while his men were running up and down , and busied about their voyage , they made signs from the tops of the houses : Caesar , being apprised of the design by them , ordered scaling-ladders to be got ready , and his men to take arms , that he might not lose any opportunity of coming to an action . <end>
<start> Pompeius sub noctem naves solvit . <end>$$<start> Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall . <end>
<start> Qui erant in muro custodiae causa collocati , eo signo , quod convenerat , revocantur notisque itineribus ad naves decurrunt . <end>$$<start> The soldiers who had been posted on the wall to guard it , were called off by the signal which had been agreed on , and knowing the roads , ran down to the ships . <end>
<start> Milites positis scalis muros ascendunt , sed moniti a Brundisinis , ut vallum caecum fossasque caveant , subsistunt et longo itinere ab his circumducti ad portum perveniunt duasque naves cum militibus , quae ad moles Caesaris adhaeserant , scaphis lintribusque reprehendunt , reprehensas excipiunt . <end>$$<start> Caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls : but being cautioned by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered trenches , they halted , and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long circuit , they reached the port , and captured with their long boats and small craft two of Pompey's ships , full of soldiers , which had struck against Caesar's moles . <end>
<start> Caesar etsi ad spem conficiendi negotii maxime probabat coactis navibus mare transire et Pompeium sequi , priusquam ille sese transmarinis auxiliis confirmaret , tamen eius rei moram temporisque longinquitatem timebat , quod omnibus coactis navibus Pompeius praesentem facultatem insequendi sui ademerat . <end>$$<start> Though Caesar highly approved of collecting a fleet , and crossing the sea , and pursuing Pompey before he could strengthen himself with his transmarine auxiliaries , with the hope of bringing the war to a conclusion , yet he dreaded the delay and length of time necessary to effect it : because Pompey , by collecting all his ships , had deprived him of the means of pursuing him at present . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur , ut ex longinquioribus regionibus Galliae Picenique et a freto naves essent exspectandae . <end>$$<start> The only resource left to Caesar , was to wait for a fleet from the distant regions of Gaul , Picenum , and the straits of Gibraltar . <end>
<start> Id propter anni tempus longum atque impeditum videbatur . <end>$$<start> But this , on account of the season of the year , appeared tedious and troublesome . <end>
<start> Interea veterem exercitum , duas Hispanias confirmari , quarum erat altera maximis beneficiis Pompei devincta , auxilia , equitatum parari , Galliam Italiamque temptari se absente nolebat . <end>$$<start> He was unwilling that , in the mean time , the veteran army , and the two Spains , one of which was bound to Pompey by the strongest obligations , should be confirmed in his interest ; that auxiliaries and cavalry should be provided , and Gaul and Italy reduced in his absence . <end>
<start> Itaque in praesentia Pompei sequendi rationem omittit , in Hispaniam proficisci constituit : duumviris municipiorum omnium imperat , ut naves conquirant Brundisiumque deducendas curent . <end>$$<start> Therefore , for the present he relinquished all intention of pursuing Pompey , and resolved to march to Spain , and commanded the magistrates of the free towns to procure him ships , and to have them convoyed to Brundusium . <end>
<start> Mittit in Sardiniam cum legione una Valerium legatum , in Siciliam Curionem pro praetore cum legionibus duabus ; eundem , cum Siciliam recepisset , protinus in Africam traducere exercitum iubet . <end>$$<start> He detached Valerius , his lieutenant , with one legion to Sardinia ; Curio , the propraetor , to Sicily with three legions ; and ordered him , when he had recovered Sicily , to immediately transport his army to Africa . <end>
<start> Sardiniam obtinebat Marcus Cotta , Siciliam Marcus Cato ; Africam sorte Tubero obtinere debebat . <end>$$<start> Marcus Cotta was at this time governor of Sardinia : Marcus Cato , of Sicily : and Tubero , by the lots , should have had the government of Africa . <end>
<start> Caralitani , simul ad se Valerium mitti audierunt , nondum profecto ex Italia sua sponte Cottam ex oppido eiciunt Ille perterritus , quod omnem provinciam consentire intellegebat , ex Sardinia in Africam profugit . <end>$$<start> The Caralitani , as soon as they heard that Valerius was sent against them , even before he left Italy , of their own accord drove Cotta out of the town ; who , terrified because he understood that the whole province was combined against him , fled from Sardinia to Africa . <end>
<start> Cato in Sicilia naves longas veteres reficiebat , novas civitatibus imperabat . <end>$$<start> Cato was in Sicily , repairing the old ships of war , and demanding new ones from the states , and these things he performed with great zeal . <end>
<start> Haec magno studio agebat In Lucanis Brutiisque per legatos suos civium Romanorum delectus habebat , equitum peditumque certum numerum a civitatibus Siciliae exigebat . <end>$$<start> He was raising levies of Roman citizens , among the Lucani and Brutii , by his lieutenants , and exacting a certain quota of horse and foot from the states of Sicily . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus paene perfectis adventu Curionis cognito queritur in contione sese proiectum ac proditum a Gnaeus Pompeio , qui omnibus rebus imparatissimis non necessarium bellum suscepisset et ab se reliquisque in senatu interrogatus omnia sibi esse ad bellum apta ac parata confirmavisset . <end>$$<start> When these things were nearly completed , being informed of Curio's approach , he made a complaint that he was abandoned and betrayed by Pompey , who had undertaken an unnecessary war , without making any preparation , and when questioned by him and other members in the senate , had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for the war . <end>
<start> Haec in contione questus ex provincia fugit . <end>$$<start> After having made these complaints in a public assembly , he fled from his province . <end>
<start> Nacti vacuas ab imperiis Sardiniam Valerius , Curio Siciliam , cum exercitibus eo perveniunt . <end>$$<start> Valerius found Sardinia , and Curio , Sicily , deserted by their governors when they arrived there with their armies . <end>
<start> Tubero cum in Africam venisset , invenit in provincia cum imperio Attium Varum ; qui ad Auximum , ut supra demonstravimus , amissis cohortibus protinus ex fuga in Africam pervenerat atque eam sua sponte vacuam occupaverat delectuque habito duas legiones effecerat , hominum et locorum notitia et usu eius provinciae nactus aditus ad ea conanda , quod paucis ante annis ex praetura eam provinciam obtinuerat . <end>$$<start> From his acquaintance with the people and country , and his knowledge of that province , he found the means of effecting this ; because a few years before , at the expiration of his praetorship , he had obtained that province . <end>
<start> His rebus confectis Caesar , ut reliquum tempus a labore intermitteretur , milites in proxima municipia deducit ; ipse ad urbem proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> When these affairs were dispatched , Caesar , that there might be an intermission from labor for the rest of the season , drew off his soldiers to the nearest municipal towns , and set off in person for Rome . <end>
<start> Coacto senatu iniurias inimicorum commemorat Docet se nullum extraordinarium honorem appetisse , sed exspectato legitimo tempore consulatus eo fuisse contentum , quod omnibus civibus pateret . <end>$$<start> Having assembled the senate , he reminded them of the injustice of his enemies ; and told them , That he aimed at no extraordinary honor , but had waited for the time appointed by law , for standing candidate for the consulate , being contented with what was allowed to every citizen . <end>
<start> Latum ab X tribunis plebis contradicentibus inimicis , Catone vero acerrime repugnante et pristina consuetudine dicendi mora dies extrahente , ut sui ratio absentis haberetur , ipso consule Pompeio ; qui si improbasset , cur ferri passus esset ? Si probasset , cur se uti populi beneficio prohibuisset ? Patientiam proponit suam , cum de exercitibus dimittendis ultro postulavisset ; in quo iacturam dignitatis atque honoris ipse facturus esset . <end>$$<start> That a bill had been carried by the ten tribunes of the people (notwithstanding the resistance of his enemies , and a very violent opposition from Cato , who in his usual manner , consumed the day by a tedious harangue) that he should be allowed to stand candidate , though absent , even in the consulship of Pompey ; and if the latter disapproved of the bill , why did he allow it to pass ? if he approved of it , why should he debar him Caesar from the people's favor ? He made mention of his own patience , in that he had freely proposed that all armies should be disbanded , by which he himself would suffer the loss both of dignity and honor . <end>
<start> Acerbitatem inimicorum docet , qui , quod ab altero postularent , in se recusarent , atque omnia permisceri mallent , quam imperium exercitusque dimittere . <end>$$<start> He urged the virulence of his enemies , who refused to comply with what they required from others , and had rather that all things should be thrown into confusion , than that they should lose their power and their armies . <end>
<start> Iniuriam in eripiendis legionibus praedicat , crudelitatem et insolentiam in circumscribendis tribunis plebis ; condiciones a se latas , expetita colloquia et denegata commemorat . <end>$$<start> He expatiated on their injustice , in taking away his legions : their cruelty and insolence in abridging the privileges of the tribunes ; the proposals he had made , and his entreaties of an interview which had been refused him . <end>
<start> Pro quibus rebus hortatur ac postulat , ut rem publicam suscipiant atque una secum administrent . <end>$$<start> For which reasons , he begged and desired that they would undertake the management of the republic , and unite with him in the administration of it . <end>
<start> Sin timore defugiant , illis se oneri non futurum et per se rem publicam administraturum . <end>$$<start> But if through fear they declined it , he would not be a burden to them , but take the management of it on himself . <end>
<start> Legatos ad Pompeium de compositione mitti oportere , neque se reformidare , quod in senatu Pompeius paulo ante dixisset , ad quos legati mitterentur , his auctoritatem attribui timoremque eorum , qui mitterent significari . <end>$$<start> That deputies ought to be sent to Pompey , to propose a reconciliation ; as he did not regard what Pompey had lately asserted in the senate , that authority was acknowledged to be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were sent , and fear implied in those that sent them . <end>
<start> Tenuis atque infirmi haec animi videri Se vero , ut operibus anteire studuerit , sic iustitia et aequitate velle superare . <end>$$<start> That these were the sentiments of low , weak minds : that for his part , as he had made it his study to surpass others in glory , so he was desirous of excelling them in justice and equity . <end>
<start> Probat rem senatus de mittendis legatis : sed , qui mitterentur , non reperiebantur , maximeque timoris causa pro se quisque id munus legationis recusabat . <end>$$<start> The senate approved of sending deputies , but none could be found fit to execute the commission : for every person , from his own private fears , declined the office . <end>
<start> Pompeius enim discedens ab urbe in senatu dixerat eodem se habiturum loco , qui Romae remansissent et qui in castris Caesaris fuissent . <end>$$<start> For Pompey , on leaving the city , had declared in the open senate , that he would hold in the same degree of estimation , those who staid in Rome and those in Caesar's camp . <end>
<start> Sic triduum disputationibus excusationibusque extrahitur . <end>$$<start> Thus three days were wasted in disputes and excuses . <end>
<start> Subicitur etiam Lucius Metellus , tribunus plebis , ab inimicis Caesaris , qui hanc rem distrahat , reliquasque res , quascumque agere instituerit , impediat . <end>$$<start> Besides , Lucius Metellus , one of the tribunes , was suborned by Caesar's enemies , to prevent this , and to embarrass every thing else which Caesar should propose . <end>
<start> Cuius cognito consilio Caesar frustra diebus aliquot consumptis , ne reliquum tempus amittat , infectis eis , quae agere destinaverat , ab urbe proficiscitur atque in ulteriorem Galliam pervenit . <end>$$<start> Caesar having discovered his intention , after spending several days to no purpose , left the city , in order that he might not lose any more time , and went to Transalpine Gaul , without effecting what he had intended . <end>
<start> Quo cum venisset , cognoscit missum a Pompeio Vibullium Rufum , quem paucis ante diebus Corfinio captum ipse dimiserat ; profectum item Domitium ad occupandam Massiliam navibus actuariis septem , quas Igilii et in Cosano a privatis coactas servis , libertis , colonis suis compleverat ; praemissos etiam legatos Massilienses domum , nobiles adulescentes , quos ab urbe discedens Pompeius erat adhortatus , ne nova Caesaris officia veterum suorum beneficiorum in eos memoriam expellerent . <end>$$<start> On his arrival there , he was informed that Vibullius Rufus , whom he had taken a few days before at Corfinium , and set at liberty , was sent by Pompey into Spain ; and that Domitius also was gone to seize Massilia with seven row-galleys , which were fitted up by some private persons at Igilium and Cosa , and which he had manned with his own slaves , freedmen , and colonists : and that some young noble men of Massilia had been sent before him ; whom Pompey , when leaving Rome had exhorted , that the late services of Caesar should not erase from their minds the memory of his former favors . <end>
<start> Quibus mandatis acceptis Massilienses portas Caesari clauserant ; Albicos , barbaros homines , qui in eorum fide antiquitus erant montesque supra Massiliam incolebant , ad se vocaverant ; frumentum ex finitimis regionibus atque ex omnibus castellis in urbem convexerant ; armorum officinas in urbe instituerant ; muros portas classem reficiebant . <end>$$<start> On receiving this message , the Massilians had shut their gates against Caesar , and invited over to them the Albici , who had formerly been in alliance with them , and who inhabited the mountains that overhung Massilia : they had likewise conveyed the corn from the surrounding country , and from all the forts into the city ; had opened armories in the city ; and were repairing the walls , the fleet , and the gates . <end>
<start> Quare paribus eorum beneficiis parem se quoque voluntatem tribuere debere et neutrum eorum contra alterum iuvare aut urbe aut portibus recipere . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , having received equal favors from both , they ought to show equal affection to both , and assist neither against the other , nor admit either into their city or harbors . <end>
<start> Haec dum inter eos aguntur , Domitius navibus Massiliam pervenit atque ab eis receptus urbi praeficitur ; summa ei belli administrandi permittitur . <end>$$<start> While this treaty was going forward , Domitius arrived at Massilia with his fleet , and was received into the city , and made governor of it . <end>
<start> Quibus iniuriis permotus Caesar legiones tres Massiliam adducit ; turres vineasque ad oppugnationem urbis agere , naves longas Arelate numero XII facere instituit . <end>$$<start> At his command they send the fleet to all parts ; they seize all the merchantmen they could meet with , and carry them into the harbor ; they apply the nails , timber , and rigging , with which they were furnished to rig and refit their other vessels . <end>
<start> Quibus effectis armatisque diebus XXX , a qua die materia caesa est , adductisque Massiliam his D . <end>$$<start> They lay up in the public stores , all the corn that was found in the ships , and reserve the rest of their lading and convoy for the siege of the town , should such an event take place . <end>
<start> Dum haec parat atque administrat , Gaius Fabium legatum cum legionibus III , quas Narbone circumque ea loca hiemandi causa disposuerat , in Hispaniam praemittit celeriterque saltus Pyrenaeos occupari iubet , qui eo tempore ab Lucius Afranio legato praesidiis tenebantur . <end>$$<start> While he was preparing and getting these things in readiness , he sent Caius Fabius one of his lieutenants into Spain with three legions , which he had disposed to winter quarters in Narbo , and the neighboring country ; and ordered him immediately to seize the passes of the Pyrenees , which were at that time occupied by detachments from Lucius Afranius , one of Pompey's lieutenants . <end>
<start> Reliquas legiones , quae longius hiemabant , subsequi iubet . <end>$$<start> He desired the other legions , which were passing the winter at a great distance , to follow close after him . <end>
<start> Fabius , ut erat imperatum , adhibita celeritate praesidium ex saltu deiecit magnisque itineribus ad exercitum Afrani contendit . <end>$$<start> Fabius , according to his orders , by using expedition , dislodged the party from the hills , and by hasty marches came up with the army of Afranius . <end>
<start> Adventu LuciusVibulli Rufi , quem a Pompeio missum in Hispaniam demonstratum est , Afranius et Petreius et Varro , legati Pompei , quorum unus Hispaniam citeriorem tribus legionibus , alter ulteriorem a saltu Castulonensi ad Anam duabus legionibus , tertius ab Ana Vettonum agrum Lusitaniamque pari numero legionum optinebat , officia inter se partiuntur , uti Petreius ex Lusitania per Vettones cum omnibus copiis ad Afranium proficiscatur , Varro cum eis , quas habebat , legionibus omnem ulteriorem Hispaniam tueatur . <end>$$<start> On the arrival of Vibullius Rufus , whom , we have already mentioned , Pompey had sent into Spain , Afranius , Petreius , and Varro , his lieutenants (one of whom had the command of Hither Spain , with three legions ; the second of the country from the forest of Castulo to the river Guadiana with two legions ; the third from the river Guadiana to the country of the Vettones and Lusitania , with the like number of legions) divided among themselves their respective departments . <end>
<start> His rebus constitutis equites auxiliaque toti Lusitaniae a Petreio , Celtiberiae , Cantabris barbarisque omnibus , qui ad Oceanum pertinent , ab Afranio imperantur . <end>$$<start> These matters being settled , reinforcements of horse and foot were demanded from Lusitania , by Petreius ; from the Celtiberi , Cantabri , and all the barbarous nations which border on the ocean , by Afranius . <end>
<start> Quibus coactis celeriter Petreius per Vettones ad Afranium pervenit , constituuntque communi consilio bellum ad Ilerdam propter ipsius opportunitatem gerere . <end>$$<start> They resolved by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity of Herba , on account of the advantages of its situation . <end>
<start> Erant , ut supra demonstratum est , legiones Afranii tres , Petreii duae , praeterea scutatae citerioris provinciae et caetratae ulterioris Hispaniae cohortes circiter LXXX equitumque utriusque provinciae circiter V milia . <end>$$<start> Afranius , as above mentioned , had three legions , Petreius two There were besides about eighty cohorts raised in Hither and Further Spain (of which , the troops belonging to the former province had shields , those of the latter targets) , and about five thousand horse raised in both provinces . <end>
<start> Audierat Pompeium per Mauretaniam cum legionibus iter in Hispaniam facere confestimque esse venturum . <end>$$<start> He had been informed that Pompey was marching through Mauritania with his legions to Spain , and would shortly arrive . <end>
<start> Simul a tribunis militum centurionibusque mutuas pecunias sumpsit ; has exercitui distribuit . <end>$$<start> He at the same time borrowed money from the tribunes and centurions , which he distributed among his soldiers . <end>
<start> Fabius finitimarum civitatum animos litteris nuntiisque temptabat . <end>$$<start> Fabius sounded the inclinations of the neighboring states by letters and messengers . <end>
<start> In Sicori flumine pontes effecerat duos distantes inter se milia passuum IIII . <end>$$<start> He had made two bridges over the river Segre , at the distance of four miles from each other . <end>
<start> His pontibus pabulatum mittebat , quod ea quae citra flumen fuerant , superioribus diebus consumpserat . <end>$$<start> He sent foraging parties over these bridges , because he had already consumed all the forage that was on his side of the river . <end>
<start> Hoc idem fere atque eadem de causa Pompeiani exercitus duces faciebant , crebroque inter se equestribus proeliis contendebant . <end>$$<start> The generals of Pompey's army did almost the same thing , and for the same reason : and the horse had frequent skirmishes with each other . <end>
<start> Huc cum cotidiana consuetudine congressae pabulatoribus praesidio propiore ponte legiones Fabianae duae flumen transissent , impedimentaque et omnis equitatus sequeretur , subito vi ventorum et aquae magnitudine pons est interruptus et reliqua multitudo equitum interclusa Quo cognito a Petreio et Afranio ex aggere atque cratibus , quae flumine ferebantur , celeriter suo ponte Afranius , quem oppido castrisque coniunctum habebat , legiones IIII equitatumque omnem traiecit duabusque Fabianis occurrit legionibus . <end>$$<start> When two of Fabius's legions had , as was their constant practice , gone forth as the usual protection to the foragers , and had crossed the river , and the baggage , and all the horse were following them , on a sudden , from the weight of the cattle , and the mass of water , the bridge fell , and all the horse were cut off from the main army , which being known to Petreius and Afranius , from the timber and hurdles that were carried down the river , Afranius immediately crossed his own bridge , which communicated between his camp and the town , with four legions and all the cavalry , and marched against Fabius's two legions . <end>
<start> Cuius adventu nuntiato Lucius Plancus , qui legionibus praeerat , necessaria re coactus locum capit superiorem diversamque aciem in duas partes constituit , ne ab equitatu circumveniri posset . <end>$$<start> When his approach was announced , Lucius Plancus , who had the command of those legions , compelled by the emergency , took post on a rising ground ; and drew up his army with two fronts , that it might not be surrounded by the cavalry . <end>
<start> Ita congressus impari numero magnos impetus legionum equitatusque sustinet . <end>$$<start> Thus , though engaged with superior numbers , he sustained the furious charge of the legions and the horse . <end>
<start> Commisso ab equitibus proelio signa legionum duarum procul ab utrisque conspiciuntur , quas Gaius Fabius ulteriore ponte subsidio nostris miserat suspicatus fore id , quod accidit , ut duces adversariorum occasione et beneficio fortunae ad nostros opprimendos uterentur . <end>$$<start> When the battle was begun by the horse , there were observed at a distance by both sides the colors of two legions , which Caius Fabius had sent round by the further bridge to reinforce our men , suspecting , as the event verified , that the enemy's generals would take advantage of the opportunity which fortune had put in their way , to attack our men . <end>
<start> Quarum adventu proelium dirimitur , ac suas uterque legiones reducit in castra . <end>$$<start> Their approach put an end to the battle , and each general led back his legions to their respective camps . <end>
<start> Eo biduo Caesar cum equitibus DCCCC , quos sibi praesidio reliquerat , in castra pervenit . <end>$$<start> In two days after Caesar came to the camp with nine hundred horse , which he had retained for a body guard . <end>
<start> Pons , qui fuerat tempestate interruptus , paene erat refectus ; hunc noctu perfici iussit . <end>$$<start> The bridge which had been broken down by the storm was almost repaired , and he ordered it to be finished in the night . <end>
<start> Ipse cognita locorum natura ponti castrisque praesidio sex cohortes reliquit atque omnia impedimenta et postero die omnibus copiis triplici instructa acie ad Ilerdam proficiscitur et sub castris Afranii constitit et ibi paulisper sub armis moratus facit aequo loco pugnandi potestatem . <end>$$<start> Being acquainted with the nature of the country , he left behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge , the camp , and all his baggage , and the next day set off in person for Ilerda , with all his forces drawn up in three lines , and halted just before the camp of Afranius , and having remained there a short time under arms , he offered him battle on equal terms . <end>
<start> Potestate facta Afranius copias educit et in medio colle sub castris constituit . <end>$$<start> When this affair was made , Afranius drew out his forces , and posted them on the middle of a hill , near his camp . <end>
<start> Caesar , ubi cognovit per Afranium stare , quo minus proelio dimicaretur , ab infimis radicibus montis intermissis circiter passibus CCCC castra facere constituit et , ne in opere faciundo milites repentino hostium incursu exterrerentur atque opere prohiberentur , vallo muniri vetuit , quod eminere et procul videri necesse erat , sed a fronte contra hostem pedum XV fossam fieri iussit . <end>$$<start> When Caesar perceived that Afranius declined coming to an engagement , he resolved to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile's distance from the very foot of the mountain ; and that his soldiers while engaged in their works , might not be terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy , or disturbed in their work , he ordered them not to fortify it with a wall , which must rise high , and be seen at a distance , but draw , on the front opposite the enemy , a trench fifteen feet broad . <end>
<start> Prima et secunda acies in armis , ut ab initio constituta erat , permanebat ; post has opus in occulto a III acie fiebat . <end>$$<start> The first and second lines confined under arms , as was from the first appointed . <end>
<start> Sic omne prius est perfectum , quam imtellegeretur ab Afranio castra muniri Sub vesperum Caesar intra hanc fossam legiones reducit atque ibi sub armis proxima nocte conquiescit . <end>$$<start> Behind them the third line was carrying on the work without being seen ; so that the whole was completed before Afranius discovered that the camp was being fortified . <end>
<start> Postero die omnem exercitum intra fossam continet et , quod longius erat agger petendus , in praesentia similem rationem operis instituit singulaque latera castrorum singulis attribuit legionibus munienda fossasque ad eandem magnitudinem perfici iubet ; reliquas legiones in armis expeditas contra hostem constituit . <end>$$<start> In the evening Caesar drew his legions within this trench , and rested them under arms the next night The day following he kept his whole army within it , and as it was necessary to bring materials from a considerable distance , he for the present pursued the same plan in his work ; and to each legion , one after the other , he assigned one side of the camp to fortify , and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be cut : he kept the rest of the legions under arms without baggage to oppose the enemy . <end>
<start> Afranius Petreiusque terrendi causa atque operis impediendi copias suas ad infimas montis radices producunt et proelio lacessunt , neque idcirco Caesar opus intermittit confisus praesidio legionum trium et munitione fossae . <end>$$<start> Caesar , however , did not interrupt his work , relying on the protection of the three legions , and the strength of the fosse . <end>
<start> Illi non diu commorati nec longius ab infimo colle progressi copias in castra reducunt . <end>$$<start> After staying for a short time , and advancing no great distance from the bottom of the hill , they led back their forces to their camp . <end>
<start> Erat inter oppidum Ilerdam et proximum collem , ubi castra Petreius atque Afranius habebant , planities circiter passuum CCC , atque in hoc fere medio spatio tumulus erat paulo editior ; quem si occupavisset Caesar et communisset , ab oppido et ponte et commeatu omni , quem in oppidum contulerant , se interclusurum adversarios confidebat . <end>$$<start> Between the town of Ilerda and the next hill , on which Afranius and Petreius were encamped , there was a plain about three hundred paces broad , and near the middle of it an eminence somewhat raised above the level : Caesar hoped that if he could get possession of this and fortify it , he should be able to cut off the enemy from the town , the bridge , and all the stores which they had laid up in the town . <end>
<start> Hoc sperans legiones III ex castris educit acieque in locis idoneis instructa unius legionis antesignanos procurrere atque eum tumulum occupare iubet . <end>$$<start> In expectation of this he led three legions out of the camp , and , drawing up his army in an advantageous position , he ordered the advanced men of one legion to hasten forward and seize the eminence . <end>
<start> Qua re cognita celeriter quae in statione pro castris erant Afranii cohortes breviore itinere ad eundem occupandum locum mittuntur . <end>$$<start> Upon intelligence of this the cohorts which were on guard before Afranius's camp were instantly sent a nearer way to occupy the same post . <end>
<start> Contenditur proelio , et quod prius in tumulum Afraniani venerant , nostri repelluntur atque aliis submissis subsidiis terga vertere seque ad signa legionum recipere coguntur . <end>$$<start> The two parties engage , and as Afranius's men had reached the eminence first , our men were repulsed , and , on a reinforcement being sent , they were obliged to turn their backs and retreat to the standards of legions . <end>
<start> Genus erat pugnae militum illorum , ut magno impetu primo procurrerent , audacter locum caperent , ordines suos non magnopere servarent , rari dispersique pugnarent ; si premerentur , pedem referre et loco excedere non turpe existimarent cum Lusitanis reliquisque barbaris barbaro genere quodam pugnae assuefacti ; quod fere fit , quibus quisque in locis miles inveteraverit , ut multum earum regionum consuetudine moveatur . <end>$$<start> The manner of fighting of those soldiers was to run forward with great impetuosity and boldly take a post , and not to keep their ranks strictly , but to fight in small scattered parties : if hard pressed they thought it no disgrace to retire and give up the post , being accustomed to this manner of fighting among the Lusitanians and other barbarous nations ; for it commonly happens that soldiers are strongly influenced by the customs of those countries in which they have spent much time . <end>
<start> Haec tum ratio nostros perturbavit insuetos huius generis pugnae : circumiri enim sese ab aperto latere procurrentibus singulis arbitrabantur ; ipsi autem suos ordines servare neque ab signis discedere neque sine gravi causa eum locum , quem ceperant , dimitti censuerant oportere . <end>$$<start> This method , however , alarmed our men , who were not used to such a description of warfare For they imagined that they were about to be surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who ran forward from their ranks ; and they thought it their duty to keep their ranks , and not to quit their colors , nor , without good reason to give up the post which they had taken . <end>
<start> Itaque perturbatis antesignanis legio , quae in eo cornu constiterat , locum non tenuit atque in proximum collem sese recepit . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , when the advanced guard gave way , the legion which was stationed on that wing did not keep its ground , but retreated to the next hill . <end>
<start> Caesar paene omni acie perterrita , quod praeter opinionem consuetudinemque acciderat , cohortatus suos legionem nonam subsidio ducit ; hostem insolenter atque acriter nostros insequentem supprimit rursusque terga vertere seque ad oppidum Ilerdam recipere et sub muro consistere cogit . <end>$$<start> Almost the whole army being daunted at this , because it had occurred contrary to their expectations and custom , Caesar encouraged his men and led the ninth legion to their relief , and checked the insolent and eager pursuit of the enemy , and obliged them , in their turn , to show their backs , and retreat to Ilerda , and take post under the walls . <end>
<start> Sed nonae legionis milites elati studio , dum sarcire acceptum detrimentum volunt , temere insecuti longius fugientes in locum iniquum progrediuntur et sub montem , in quo erat oppidum positum Ilerda , succedunt . <end>$$<start> But the soldiers of the ninth legion , being over zealous to repair the dishonor which had been sustained , having rashly pursued the fleeing enemy , advanced into disadvantageous ground and went up to the foot of the mountain on which the town Ilerda was built . <end>
<start> Hinc se recipere cum vellent , rursus illi ex loco superiore nostros premebant . <end>$$<start> And when they wished to retire they were again attacked by the enemy from the rising ground . <end>
<start> Praeruptus locus erat utraque ex parte derectus ac tantum in latitudinem patebat , ut tres instructae cohortes eum locum explerent , ut neque subsidia ab lateribus submitti neque equites laborantibus usui esse possent . <end>$$<start> The place was craggy in the front and steep on either side , and was so narrow that even three cohorts , drawn up in order of battle , would fill it ; but no relief could be sent on the flanks , and the horse could be of no service to them when hard pressed . <end>
<start> Ab oppido autem declivis locus tenui fastigio vergebat in longitudinem passuum circiter CCCC . <end>$$<start> From the town , indeed , the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near four hundred paces . <end>
<start> Augebatur illis copia , atque ex castris cohortes per oppidum crebro submittebantur , ut integri defessis succederent . <end>$$<start> The enemy's forces were increasing , and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from the camp through the town , that fresh men might relieve the weary . <end>
<start> Hoc idem Caesar facere cogebatur , ut submissis in eundem locum cohortibus defessos reciperet . <end>$$<start> Caesar was obliged to do the same , and relieve the fatigued by sending cohorts to that post . <end>
<start> Hoc cum esset modo pugnatum continenter horis quinque nostrique gravius a multitudine premerentur , consumptis omnibus telis gladiis destrictis impetum adversus montem in cohortes faciunt , paucisque deiectis reliquos sese convertere cogunt . <end>$$<start> After the battle had in this manner continued incessantly for five hours , and our men had suffered much from superior numbers , having spent all their javelins , they drew their swords and charged the enemy up the hill , and , having killed a few , obliged the rest to fly . <end>
<start> Submotis sub murum cohortibus ac nonnullam partem propter terrorem in oppidum compulsis facilis est nostris receptus datus . <end>$$<start> The cohorts being beaten back to the wall , and some being driven by their fears into the town , an easy retreat was afforded to our men . <end>
<start> Equitatus autem noster ab utroque latere , etsi deiectis atque inferioribus locis constiterat , tamen summa in iugum virtute connititur atque inter duas acies perequitans commodiorem ac tutiorem nostris receptum dat . <end>$$<start> Our cavalry also , on either flank , though stationed on sloping or low ground , yet bravely struggled up to the top of the hill , and , riding between the two armies , made our retreat more easy and secure . <end>
<start> Ita vario certamine pugnatum est . <end>$$<start> Such were the various turns of fortune in the battle . <end>
<start> Nostri in primo congressu circiter LXX ceciderunt , in his Quintus Fulginius ex primo hastato legionis XIIII , qui propter eximiam virtutem ex inferioribus ordinibus in eum locum pervenerat ; vulnerantur amplius DC . <end>$$<start> In the first encounter about seventy of our men fell : among them Quintus Fulgenius , first centurion of the second line of the fourteenth legion , who , for his extraordinary valor , had been promoted from the lower ranks to that post . <end>
<start> Ex Afranianis interficiuntur Titus Caecilius , primi pili centurio , et praeter eum centuriones IIII , milites amplius CC . <end>$$<start> About six hundred were wounded Of Afranius's party there were killed Titus Caecilius , principal centurion , and four other centurions , and above two hundred men . <end>
<start> Sed haec eius diei praefertur opinio , ut se utrique superiores discessisse existimarent : Afraniani , quod , cum esse omnium iudicio inferiores viderentur , comminus tam diu stetissent et nostrorum impetum sustinuissent et initio locum tumulumque tenuissent , quae causa pugnandi fuerat , et nostros primo congressu terga vertere coegissent ; nostri autem , quod iniquo loco atque impari congressi numero quinque horis proelium sustinuissent , quod montem gladiis destrictis ascendissent , quod ex loco superiore terga vertere adversarios coegissent atque in oppidum compulissent . <end>$$<start> But this opinion is spread abroad concerning this day , that each party thought that they came off conquerors Afranius's soldiers , because , though they were esteemed inferior in the opinion of all , yet they had stood our attack and sustained our charge , and , at first , had kept the post on the hill which had been the occasion of the dispute ; and , in the first encounter , had obliged our men to fly : but ours , because , notwithstanding the disadvantage of the ground and the disparity of numbers , they had maintained the battle for five hours , had advanced up the hill sword in hand , and had forced the enemy to fly from the higher ground and driven them into the town . <end>
<start> Illi eum tumulum , pro quo pugnatum est , magnis operibus munierunt praesidiumque ibi posuerunt . <end>$$<start> The enemy fortified the hill , about which the contest had been , with strong works and posted a garrison on it . <end>
<start> Accidit etiam repentinum incommodum biduo , quo haec gesta sunt . <end>$$<start> In two days after this transaction , there happened an unexpected misfortune . <end>
<start> Tanta enim tempestas cooritur , ut numquam illis locis maiores aquas fuisse constaret Tum autem ex omnibus montibus nives proluit ac summas ripas fluminis superavit pontesque ambo , quos Gaius Fabius fecerat , uno die interrupit . <end>$$<start> For so great a storm arose , that it was agreed that there were never seen higher floods in those countries ; it swept down the snow from all the mountains , and broke over the banks of the river , and in one day carried away both the bridges which Fabius had built- a circumstance which caused great difficulties to Caesar's army . <end>
<start> Castra enim , ut supra demonstratum est , cum essent inter flumina duo , Sicorim et Cingam , spatio milium XXX , neutrum horum transiri poterat , necessarioque omnes his angustiis continebantur . <end>$$<start> Neither could the states , which had espoused Caesar's cause , furnish him with corn , nor the troops , which had gone far to forage , return , as they were stopped by the waters : nor could the convoys , coming from Italy and Gaul , make their way to the camp . <end>
<start> Neque civitates , quae ad Caesaris amicitiam accesserant , frumentum supportare , neque ei , qui pabulatum longius progressi erant , interclusi fluminibus reverti neque maximi commeatus , qui ex Italia Galliaque veniebant , in castra pervenire poterant . <end>$$<start> Besides , it was the most distressing season of the year , when there was no corn in the blade , and it was nearly ripe : and the states were exhausted , because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn , before Caesar's arrival , into Ilerda , and whatever he had left , had been already consumed by Caesar . <end>
<start> Qui erant pabulandi aut frumentandi causa progressi , hos levis armaturae Lusitani peritique earum regionum cetrati citerioris Hispaniae consectabantur ; quibus erat proclive tranare flumen , quod consuetudo eorum omnium est , ut sine utribus ad exercitum non eant . <end>$$<start> They who had gone out to get forage or corn , were chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians , and the targeteers of Hither Spain , who were well acquainted with the country , and could readily swim across the river , because it is the custom of all those people not to join their armies without bladders . <end>
<start> At exercitus Afranii omnium rerum abundabat copia Multum erat frumentum provisum et convectum superioribus temporibus , multum ex omni provincia comportabatur ; magna copia pabuli suppetebat . <end>$$<start> But Afranius's army had abundance of everything ; a great stock of corn had been provided and laid in long before , a large quantity was coming in from the whole province : they had a good store of forage . <end>
<start> Harum omnium rerum facultates sine ullo periculo pons Ilerdae praebebat et loca trans flumen integra , quo omnino Caesar adire non poterat . <end>$$<start> The bridge of Ilerda afforded an opportunity of getting all these without any danger , and the places beyond the bridge , to which Caesar had no access , were as yet untouched . <end>
<start> Hae permanserunt aquae dies complures . <end>$$<start> Those floods continued several days . <end>
<start> Conatus est Caesar reficere pontes ; sed nec magnitudo fluminis permittebat , neque ad ripam dispositae cohortes adversariorum perfici patiebantur Quod illis prohibere erat facile cum ipsius fluminis natura atque aquae magnitudine , tum quod ex totis ripis in unum atque angustum locum tela iaciebantur ; atque erat difficile eodem tempore rapidissimo flumine opera perficere et tela vitare . <end>$$<start> Caesar endeavored to repair the bridges , but the height of the water did not allow him : and the cohorts disposed along the banks did not suffer them to be completed ; and it was easy for them to prevent it , both from the nature of the river and the height of the water , but especially because their darts were thrown from the whole course of the bank on one confined spot ; and it was no easy matter at one and the same time to execute a work in a very rapid flood , and to avoid the darts . <end>
<start> Nuntiatur Afranio magnos commeatus , qui iter habebant ad Caesarem , ad flumen constitisse . <end>$$<start> Intelligence was brought to Afranius that the great convoys , which were on their march to Caesar , had halted at the river . <end>
<start> Venerant eo sagittarii ex Rutenis , equites ex Gallia cum multis carris magnisque impedimentis , ut fert Gallica consuetudo Erant praeterea cuiusque generis hominum milia circiter VI cum servis liberisque ; sed nullus ordo , nullum imperium certum , cum suo quisque consilio uteretur atque omnes sine timore iter facerent usi superiorum temporum atque itinerum licentia . <end>$$<start> Archers from the Rutheni , and horse from the Gauls , with a long train of baggage , according to the Gallic custom of traveling , had arrived there ; there were besides about six thousand people of all descriptions , with slaves and freed men . <end>
<start> Erant complures honesti adulescentes , senatorum filii et ordinis equestris ; erant legationes civitatum ; erant legati Caesaris . <end>$$<start> But there was no order , or regular discipline , as every one followed his own humor , and all traveled without apprehension , taking the same liberty as on former marches . <end>
<start> Ei , dum pari certamine res geri potuit , magnum hostium numerum pauci sustinuere ; sed ubi signa legionum appropinquare coeperunt , paucis amissis sese in proximos montes conferunt . <end>$$<start> Though but few , they withstood the vast number of the enemy , as long as they fought on equal terms ; but when the legions began to approach , having lost a few men , they retreated to the next mountains . <end>
<start> Hoc pugnae tempus magnum attulit nostris ad salutem momentum ; nacti enim spatium se in loca superiora receperunt . <end>$$<start> The delay occasioned by this battle was of great importance to the security of our men ; for having gained time , they retired to the higher grounds . <end>
<start> Desiderati sunt eo die sagittarii circiter CC , equites pauci , calonum atque impedimentorum non magnus numerus . <end>$$<start> There were missing that day about two hundred bow-men , a few horse , and an inconsiderable number of servants and baggage . <end>
<start> His tamen omnibus annona crevit ; quae fere res non solum inopia praesentis , sed etiam futuri temporis timore ingravescere consuevit . <end>$$<start> However , by all these things , the price of provisions was raised , which is commonly a disaster attendant , not only on a time of present scarcity , but on the apprehension of future want . <end>
<start> Haec Afranius Petreiusque et eorum amici pleniora etiam atque uberiora Romam ad suos perscribebant ; multa rumor affingebat , ut paene bellum confectum videretur . <end>$$<start> Afranius and Petreius , and their friends , sent fuller and more circumstantial accounts of these things to Rome , to their acquaintances . <end>
<start> Quibus litteris nuntiisque Romam perlatis magni domum concursus ad Afranium magnaeque gratulationes fiebant ; multi ex Italia ad Gnaeus Pompeium proficiscebantur , alii , ut principes talem nuntium attulisse , alii ne eventum belli exspectasse aut ex omnibus novissimi venisse viderentur . <end>$$<start> Report exaggerated them so that the war appeared to be almost at an end When these letters and dispatches were received at Rome , a great concourse of people resorted to the house of Afranius , and congratulations ran high ; several went out of Italy to Cneius Pompey ; some of them , to be the first to bring him the intelligence ; others , that they might not be thought to have waited the issue of the war , and to have come last of all . <end>
<start> Cum in his angustiis res esset , atque omnes viae ab Afranianis militibus equitibusque obsiderentur , nec pontes perfici possent , imperat militibus Caesar , ut naves faciant , cuius generis eum superioribus annis usus Britanniae docuerat . <end>$$<start> When Caesar's affairs were in this unfavorable position , and all the passes were guarded by the soldiers and horse of Afranius , and the bridges could not be prepared , Caesar ordered his soldiers to make ships of the kind that his knowledge of Britain a few years before had taught him . <end>
<start> Carinae ac prima statumina ex levi materia fiebant ; reliquum corpus navium viminibus contextum coriis integebatur . <end>$$<start> First , the keels and ribs were made of light timber , then , the rest of the hulk of the ships was wrought with wicker work , and covered over with hides . <end>
<start> Has perfectas carris iunctis devehit noctu milia passuum a castris XXII militesque his navibus flumen transportat continentemque ripae collem improviso occupat . <end>$$<start> When these were finished , he drew them down to the river in wagons in one night , a distance of twenty-two miles from his camp , and transported in them some soldiers across the river , and on a sudden took possession of a hill adjoining the bank . <end>
<start> Hunc celeriter , priusquam ab adversariis sentiatur , communit . <end>$$<start> This he immediately fortified , before he was perceived by the enemy . <end>
<start> Huc legionem postea traicit atque ex utraque parte pontem instituit , biduo perficit . <end>$$<start> To this he afterward transported a legion : and having begun a bridge on both sides , he finished it in two days . <end>
<start> Ita commeatus et qui frumenti causa processerant tuto ad se recipit et rem frumentariam expedire incipit . <end>$$<start> By this means , he brought safe to his camp , the convoys , and those who had gone out to forage ; and began to prepare a conveyance for the provisions . <end>
<start> Eodem die equitum magnam partem flumen traiecit Qui inopinantes pabulatores et sine ullo dissipatos timore aggressi magnum numerum iumentorum atque hominum intercipiunt cohortibusque cetratis subsidio missis scienter in duas partes sese distribuunt , alii ut praedae praesidio sint , alii ut venientibus resistant atque eos propellant , unamque cohortem , quae temere ante ceteras extra aciem procurrerat , seclusam ab reliquis circumveniunt atque interficiunt incolumesque cum magna praeda eodem ponte in castra revertuntur . <end>$$<start> The same day he made a great part of his horse pass the river , who , falling on the foragers by surprise as they were dispersed without any suspicions , intercepted an incredible number of cattle and people ; and when some Spanish light-armed cohorts were sent to reinforce the enemy , our men judiciously divided themselves into two parts , the one to protect the spoil , the other to resist the advancing foe , and to beat them back , and they cut off from the rest and surrounded one cohort , which had rashly ventured out of the line before the others , and after putting it to the sword , returned safe with considerable booty to the camp over the same bridge . <end>
<start> Dum haec ad Ilerdam geruntur , Massilienses usi Lucius Domitii consilio naves longas expediunt numero XVII , quarum erant XI tectae . <end>$$<start> While these affairs are going forward at Ilerda , the Massilians , adopting the advice of Domitius , prepared seventeen ships of war , of which eleven were decked . <end>
<start> Multa huc minora navigia addunt , ut ipsa multitudine nostra classis terreatur Magnum numerum sagittariorum , magnum Albicorum , de quibus supra demonstratum est , imponunt atque hos praemiis pollicitationibusque incitant . <end>$$<start> To these they add several smaller vessels , that our fleet might be terrified by numbers ; they man them with a great number of archers and of the Albici , of whom mention has been already made , and these they incited by rewards and promises . <end>
<start> Certas sibi deposcit naves Domitius atque has colonis pastoribusque , quos secum adduxerat , complet . <end>$$<start> Domitius required certain ships for his own use , which he manned with colonists and shepherds , whom he had brought along with him . <end>
<start> Sic omnibus rebus instructa classe magna fiducia ad nostras naves procedunt , quibus praeerat D . <end>$$<start> A fleet being thus furnished with every necessary , he advanced with great confidence against our ships , commanded by Decimus Brutus . <end>
<start> Brutus Hae ad insulam , quae est contra Massiliam , stationes obtinebant . <end>$$<start> It was stationed at an island opposite to Massilia . <end>
<start> Erat multo inferior numero navium Brutus ; sed electos ex omnibus legionibus fortissimos viros , antesignanos , centuriones , Caesar ei classi attribuerat , qui sibi id muneris depoposcerant . <end>$$<start> Brutus was much inferior in number of ships ; but Caesar had appointed to that fleet the bravest men selected from all his legions , antesignani and centurions , who had requested to be employed in that service . <end>
<start> Hi manus ferreas atque harpagones paraverant magnoque numero pilorum , tragularum reliquorumque telorum se instruxerant . <end>$$<start> They had provided iron hooks and harpoons , and had furnished themselves with a vast number of javelins , darts , and missiles . <end>
<start> Ita cognito hostium adventu suas naves ex portu educunt , cum Massiliensibus confligunt . <end>$$<start> Thus prepared , and being apprised of the enemy's approach , they put out from the harbor , and engaged the Massilians . <end>
<start> Pugnatum est utrimque fortissime atque acerrime ; neque multum Albici nostris virtute cedebant , homines asperi et montani , exercitati in armis ; atque hi modo digressi a Massiliensibus recentem eorum pollicitationem animis continebant , pastoresque Domitii spe libertatis excitati sub oculis domini suam probare operam studebant . <end>$$<start> Both sides fought with great courage and resolution ; nor did the Albici , a hardy people , bred on the highlands and inured to arms , fall much short of our men in valor : and being lately come from the Massilians , they retained in their minds their recent promises : and the wild shepherds , encouraged by the hope of liberty , were eager to prove their zeal in the presence of their masters . <end>
<start> Ipsi Massilienses et celeritate navium et scientia gubernatorum confisi nostros eludebant impetusque eorum excipiebant et , quoad licebat latiore uti spatio , producta longius acie circumvenire nostros aut pluribus navibus adoriri singulas aut remos transcurrentes detergere , si possent , contendebant ; cum propius erat necessario ventum , ab scientia gubernatorum atque artificiis ad virtutem montanorum confugiebant . <end>$$<start> The Massilians themselves , confiding in the quickness of their ships , and the skill of their pilots , eluded ours , and evaded the shock , and as long as they were permitted by clear space , lengthening their line they endeavored to surround us , or to attack single ships with several of theirs , or to run across our ships , and carry away our oars , if possible ; but when necessity obliged them to come nearer , they had recourse , from the skill and art of the pilots , to the valor of the mountaineers . <end>
<start> Nostri cum minus exercitatis remigibus minusque peritis gubernatoribus utebantur , qui repente ex onerariis navibus erant producti neque dum etiam vocabulis armamentorum cognitis , tum etiam tarditate et gravitate navium impediebantur ; factae enim subito ex humida materia non eundem usum celeritatis habebant . <end>$$<start> But our men , not having such expert seamen , or skillful pilots , for they had been hastily drafted from the merchant ships , and were not yet acquainted even with the names of the rigging , were moreover impeded by the heaviness and slowness of our vessels , which having been built in a hurry and of green timber , were not so easily maneuvered . <end>
<start> Itaque , dum locus comminus pugnandi daretur , aequo animo singulas binis navibus obiciebant atque iniecta manu ferrea et retenta utraque nave diversi pugnabant atque in hostium naves transcendebant et magno numero Albicorum et pastorum interfecto partem navium deprimunt , nonnullas cum hominibus capiunt , reliquas in portum compellunt . <end>$$<start> Therefore , when Caesar's men had an opportunity of a close engagement , they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of theirs And throwing in the grappling-irons , and holding both ships fast , they fought on both sides of the deck , and boarded the enemy's ; and having killed numbers of the Albici and shepherds , they sank some of their ships , took others with the men on board , and drove the rest into the harbor . <end>
<start> Eo die naves Massiliensium cum eis , quae sunt captae , intereunt VIIII . <end>$$<start> That day the Massilians lost nine ships , including those that were taken . <end>
<start> Hoc primum Caesari ad Ilerdam nuntiatur ; simul perfecto ponte celeriter fortuna mutatur . <end>$$<start> When news of this battle was brought to Caesar at Ilerda , the bridge being completed at the same time , fortune soon took a turn . <end>
<start> Interim Oscenses et Calagurritani , qui erant Oscensibus contributi , mittunt ad eum legatos seseque imperata facturos pollicentur . <end>$$<start> In the mean time the Oscenses and the Calagurritani , who were under the government of the Oscenses , send embassadors to Caesar , and offer to submit to his orders . <end>
<start> Hos Tarraconenses et Iacetani et Ausetani et paucis post diebus Illurgavonenses , qui flumen Hiberum attingunt , insequuntur . <end>$$<start> They are followed by the Tarraconenses , Jacetani , and Ausetani , and in a few days more by the Illurgavonenses , who dwell near the river Ebro . <end>
<start> Petit ab his omnibus , ut se frumento iuvent Pollicentur atque omnibus undique conquisitis iumentis in castra deportant . <end>$$<start> He requires of them all , to assist him with corn , to which they agreed , and having collected all the cattle in the country , they convey them into his camp . <end>
<start> Transit etiam cohors Illurgavonensis ad eum cognito civitatis consilio et signa ex statione transfert . <end>$$<start> One entire cohort of the Illurgavonenses , knowing the design of their state , came over to Caesar , from the place where they were stationed , and carried their colors with them . <end>
<start> Magna celeriter commutatio rerum . <end>$$<start> A great change is shortly made in the face of affairs . <end>
<start> Perfecto ponte , magnis quinque civitatibus ad amicitiam adiunctis , expedita re frumentaria , exstinctis rumoribus de auxiliis legionum , quae cum Pompeio per Mauritaniam venire dicebantur , multae longinquiores civitates ab Afranio desciscunt et Caesaris amicitiam sequuntur . <end>$$<start> The bridge being finished , five powerful states being joined to Caesar , a way opened for the receiving of corn , and the rumors of the assistance of legions which were said to be on their march , with Pompey at their head , through Mauritania , having died away , several of the more distant states revolt from Afranius , and enter into league with Caesar . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus perterritis animis adversariorum Caesar , ne semper magno circuitu per pontem equitatus esset mittendus , nactus idoneum locum fossas pedum XXX in latitudinem complures facere instituit , quibus partem aliquam Sicoris averteret vadumque in eo flumine efficeret . <end>$$<start> While the spirits of the enemy were dismayed at these things , Caesar , that he might not be always obliged to send his horse a long circuit round by the bridge , having found a convenient place , began to sink several drains , thirty feet deep , by which he might draw off a part of the river Segre , and make a ford over it . <end>
<start> His paene effectis magnum in timorem Afranius Petreiusque perveniunt , ne omnino frumento pabuloque intercluderentur , quod multum Caesar equitatu valebat . <end>$$<start> When these were almost finished , Afranius and Petreius began to be greatly alarmed , lest they should be altogether cut off from corn and forage , because Caesar was very strong in cavalry . <end>
<start> Itaque constituunt illis locis excedere et in Celtiberiam bellum transferre . <end>$$<start> They therefore resolved to quit their posts , and to transfer the war to Celtiberia . <end>
<start> Huic consilio suffragabatur etiam illa res , quod ex duobus contrariis generibus , quae superiore bello cum Sertorio steterant civitates , victae nomen atque imperium absentis Pompei timebant , quae in amicitia manserant , magnis affectae beneficiis eum diligebant ; Caesaris autem erat in barbaris nomen obscurius . <end>$$<start> There was , moreover , a circumstance that confirmed them in this resolution : for of the two adverse parties , that , which had stood by Sertorius in the late war , being conquered by Pompey , still trembled at his name and sway , though absent : the other which had remained firm in Pompey's interest , loved him for the favors which they had received : but Caesar's name was not known to the barbarians . <end>
<start> Hic magnos equitatus magnaque auxilia exspectabant et suis locis bellum in hiemem ducere cogitabant . <end>$$<start> From these they expected considerable aid , both of horse and foot , and hoped to protract the war till winter , in a friendly country . <end>
<start> Hoc inito consilio toto flumine Hibero naves conquiri et Octogesam adduci iubent Id erat oppidum positum ad Hiberum miliaque passuum a castris aberat XXX . <end>$$<start> Having come to this resolution , they gave orders to collect all the ships in the river Ebro , and to bring them to Octogesa , a town situated on the river Ebro , about twenty miles distant from their camp . <end>
<start> Ad eum locum fluminis navibus iunctis pontem imperant fieri legionesque duas flumen Sicorim traducunt , castraque muniunt vallo pedum XII . <end>$$<start> At this part of the river , they ordered a bridge to be made of boats fastened together , and transported two legions over the river Segre , and fortified their camp with a rampart , twelve feet high . <end>
<start> Qua re per exploratores cognita summo labore militum Caesar continuato diem noctemque opere in flumine avertendo huc iam rem deduxerat , ut equites , etsi difficulter atque aegre fiebat , possent tamen atque auderent flumen transire , pedites vero tantummodo umeris ac summo pectore exstarent et cum altitudine aquae tum etiam rapiditate fluminis ad transeundum impedirentur . <end>$$<start> Notice of this being given by the scouts , Caesar continued his work day and night , with very great fatigue to the soldiers , to drain the river , and so far effected his purpose , that the horse were both able and bold enough , though with some difficulty and danger , to pass the river ; but the foot had only their shoulders and upper part of their breast above the water , so that their fording it was retarded , not only by the depth of the water , but also by the rapidity of the current . <end>
<start> Sed tamen eodem fere tempore pons in Hibero prope effectus nuntiabatur , et in Sicori vadum reperiebatur . <end>$$<start> However , almost at the same instant , news was received of the bridge being nearly completed over the Ebro , and a ford was found in the Segre . <end>
<start> Iam vero eo magis illi maturandum iter existimabant . <end>$$<start> Now indeed the enemy began to think that they ought to hasten their march . <end>
<start> Itaque duabus auxiliaribus cohortibus Ilerdae praesidio relictis omnibus copiis Sicorim transeunt et cum duabus legionibus , quas superioribus diebus traduxerant , castra coniungunt . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , leaving two auxiliary cohorts in the garrison at Ilerda , they crossed the Segre with their whole force , and formed one camp with the two legions which they had led across a few days before . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur Caesari nihil , nisi uti equitatu agmen adversariorum male haberet et carperet Pons enim ipsius magnum circuitum habebat , ut multo breviore itinere illi ad Hiberum pervenire possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar had no resource , but to annoy and cut down their rear ; since with his cavalry to go by the bridge , required him to take a long circuit ; so that they would arrive at the Ebro by a much shorter route . <end>
<start> Equites ab eo missi flumen transeunt et , cum de tertia vigilia Petreius atque Afranius castra movissent , repente sese ad novissimum agmen ostendunt et magna multitudine circumfusa morari atque iter impedire incipiunt . <end>$$<start> The horse , which he had detached , crossed the ford , and when Afranius and Petreius had broken up their camp about the third watch , they suddenly appeared on their rear , and spreading round them in great numbers , retard and impede their march . <end>
<start> Prima luce ex superioribus locis , quae Caesaris castris erant coniuncta , cernebatur equitatus nostri proelio novissimos illorum premi vehementer ac nonnumquam sustineri extremum agmen atque interrumpi , alias inferri signa et universarum cohortium impetu nostros propelli , dein rursus conversos insequi . <end>$$<start> At break of day , it was perceived from the rising grounds which joined Caesar's camp , that their rear was vigorously pressed by our horse ; that the last line sometimes halted and was broken ; at other times , that they joined battle and that our men were beaten back by a general charge of their cohorts , and , in their turn , pursued them when they wheeled about : but through the whole camp the soldiers gathered in parties , and declared their chagrin that the enemy had been suffered to escape from their hands and that the war had been unnecessarily protracted . <end>
<start> Totis vero castris milites circulari et dolere hostem ex manibus dimitti , bellum non necessario longius duci ; centuriones tribunosque militum adire atque obsecrare , ut per eos Caesar certior fieret , ne labori suo neu periculo parceret ; paratos esse sese , posse et audere ea transire flumen , qua traductus esset equitatus . <end>$$<start> They applied to their tribunes and centurions , and entreated them to inform Caesar that he need not spare their labor or consider their danger ; that they were ready and able , and would venture to ford the river where the horse had crossed . <end>
<start> Quorum studio et vocibus excitatus Caesar , etsi timebat tantae magnitudini fluminis exercitum obicere , conandum tamen atque experiendum iudicat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , encouraged by their zeal and importunity , though he felt reluctant to expose his army to a river so exceedingly large , yet judged it prudent to attempt it and make a trial . <end>
<start> Itaque infirmiores milites ex omnibus centuriis deligi iubet , quorum aut animus aut vires videbantur sustinere non posse Hos cum legione una praesidio castris relinquit ; reliquas legiones expeditas educit magnoque numero iumentorum in flumine supra atque infra constituto traducit exercitum . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , he ordered all the weaker soldiers , whose spirit or strength seemed unequal to the fatigue , to be selected from each century , and left them , with one legion besides , to guard the camp : the rest of the legions he drew out without any baggage , and , having disposed a great number of horses in the river , above and below the ford , he led his army over . <end>
<start> Pauci ex his militibus abrepti vi fluminis ab equitatu excipiuntur ac sublevantur ; interit tamen nemo . <end>$$<start> A few of his soldiers being carried away by the force of the current , were stopped by the horse and taken up , and not a man perished . <end>
<start> Traducto incolumi exercitu copias instruit triplicemque aciem ducere incipit Ac tantum fuit in militibus studii , ut milium sex ad iter addito circuitu magnaque ad vadum fluminis mora interposita eos , qui de tertia vigilia exissent , ante horam diei VIIII consequerentur . <end>$$<start> His army being safe on the opposite bank , he drew out his forces and resolved to lead them forward in three battalions : and so great was the ardor of the soldiers that , notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six miles and a considerable delay in fording the river , before the ninth hour of the day they came up with those who had set out at the third watch . <end>
<start> Quos ubi Afranius procul visos cum Petreio conspexit , nova re perterritus locis superioribus constitit aciemque instruit . <end>$$<start> When Afranius , who was in company with Petreius , saw them at a distance , being affrighted at so unexpected a sight , he halted on a rising ground and drew up his army . <end>
<start> Illi necessario maturius , quam constituerant , castra ponunt Suberant enim montes , atque a milibus passuum V itinera difficilia atque angusta excipiebant . <end>$$<start> Caesar refreshed his army on the plain that he might not expose them to battle while fatigued ; and when the enemy attempted to renew their march , he pursued and stopped them . <end>
<start> Hos montes intrasse cupiebant , ut equitatum effugerent Caesaris praesidiisque in angustiis collocatis exercitum itinere prohiberent , ipsi sine periculo ac timore Hiberum copias traducerent . <end>$$<start> They were obliged to pitch their camp sooner than they had intended , for there were mountains at a small distance ; and difficult and narrow roads awaited them about five miles off . <end>
<start> Quod fuit illis conandum atque omni ratione efficiendum ; sed totius diei pugna atque itineris labore defessi rem in posterum diem distulerunt . <end>$$<start> They retired behind these mountains that they might avoid Caesar's cavalry , and , placing parties in the narrow roads , stop the progress of his army and lead their own forces across the Ebro without danger or apprehension . <end>
<start> Media circiter nocte eis , qui aquandi causa longius a castris processerant , ab equitibus correptis fit ab his certior Caesar duces adversariorum silentio copias castris educere . <end>$$<start> About midnight a few of their men who had gone some distance from the camp to fetch water , being taken by our horse , Caesar is informed by them that the generals of the enemy were drawing their troops out of the camp without noise . <end>
<start> Postero die Petreius cum paucis equitibus occulte ad exploranda loca proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> A similar movement was made from Caesar's camp . <end>
<start> Disputatur in consilio a Petreio atque Afranio et tempus profectionis quaeritur . <end>$$<start> There was a debate in the council between Afranius and Petreius , and the time of marching was the subject . <end>
<start> Quare omni ratione esse interdiu perrumpendum : etsi aliquo accepto detrimento , tamen summa exercitus salva locum , quem petant , capi posse . <end>$$<start> Wherefore they should , by all means , attempt to force their way by day ; for , though a trifling loss might be sustained , yet the post which they desired might be secured with safety to the main body of the army . <end>
<start> Nam quae itinera ad Hiberum atque Octogesam pertinebant castris hostium oppositis tenebantur . <end>$$<start> His soldiers were obliged to cross extensive and difficult valleys . <end>
<start> Ipsi erant transcendendae valles maximae ac difflcillimae ; saxa multis locis praerupta iter impediebant , ut arma per manus necessario traderentur , militesque inermes sublevatique alii ab aliis magnam partem itineris conficerent . <end>$$<start> Craggy cliffs , in several places , interrupted their march , insomuch that their arms had to be handed to one another , and the soldiers were forced to perform a great part of their march unarmed , and were lifted up the rocks by each other . <end>
<start> Sed hunc laborem recusabat nemo , quod eum omnium laborum finem fore existimabant , si hostem Hibero intercludere et frumento prohibere potuissent . <end>$$<start> But not a man murmured at the fatigue , because they imagined that there would be a period to all their toils , if they could cut off the enemy from the Ebro and intercept their convoys . <end>
<start> Ac primo Afraniani milites visendi causa laeti ex castris procurrebant contumeliosisque vocibus prosequebantur nostros : necessarii victus inopia coactos fugere atque ad Ilerdam reverti . <end>$$<start> At first , Afranius's soldiers ran in high spirits from their camp to look at us , and in contumelious language upbraided us , that we were forced , for want of necessary subsistence , to run away , and return to Ilerda . <end>
<start> Erat enim iter a proposito diversum , contrariamque in partem iri videbatur . <end>$$<start> For our route was different from what we proposed , and we appeared to be going a contrary way . <end>
<start> Duces vero eorum consilium suum laudibus efferebant , quod se castris tenuissent ; multumque eorum opinionem adiuvabat , quod sine iumentis impedimentisque ad iter profectos videbant , ut non posse inopiam diutius sustinere confiderent . <end>$$<start> But their generals applauded their own prudence in keeping within their camp , and it was a strong confirmation of their opinion , that they saw we marched without wagons or baggage , which made them confident that we could not long endure want . <end>
<start> Sed , ubi paulatim retorqueri agmen ad dextram conspexerunt iamque primos superare regionem castrorum animum adverterunt , nemo erat adeo tardus aut fugiens laboris , quin statim castris exeundum atque occurrendum putaret . <end>$$<start> But when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right , and observed our van was already passing the line of their camp , there was nobody so stupid , or averse to fatigue , as not to think it necessary to march from the camp immediately , and oppose us . <end>
<start> Conclamatur ad arma , atque omnes copiae paucis praesidio relictis cohortibus exeunt rectoque ad Hiberum itinere contendunt . <end>$$<start> The cry to arms was raised , and all the army , except a few which were left to guard the camp , set out and marched the direct road to the Ebro . <end>
<start> Erat in celeritate omne positum certamen , utri prius angustias montesque occuparent ; sed exercitum Caesaris viarum difficultates tardabant , Afranii copias equitatus Caesaris insequens morabatur . <end>$$<start> The contest depended entirely on dispatch , which should first get possession of the defile and the mountains . <end>
<start> Afranius , cum ab equitatu novissimum agmen premeretur , ante se hostem videret , collem quendam nactus ibi constitit . <end>$$<start> Caesar first accomplished the march , and having found a plain behind large rocks , drew up his army there in order of battle and facing the enemy . <end>
<start> Ex eo loco IIII cetratorum cohortes in montem , qui erat in conspectu omnium excelsissimus , mittit . <end>$$<start> Afranius , perceiving that his rear was galled by our cavalry , and seeing the enemy before him , having come to a hill , made a halt on it . <end>
<start> Hunc cum obliquo itinere cetrati peterent , conspicatus equitatus Caesaris in cohortes impetum fecit ; nec minimam partem temporis equitum vim cetrati sustinere potuerunt omnesque ab eis circumventi in conspectu utriusque exercitus interficiuntur . <end>$$<start> As the Spaniards were making toward it in an oblique direction , Caesar's horse espied them and attacked them , nor were they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment , but were all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the two armies . <end>
<start> Erat occasio bene gerendae rei Neque vero id Caesarem fugiebat , tanto sub oculis accepto detrimento perterritum exercitum sustinere non posse , praesertim circumdatum undique equitatu , cum in loco aequo atque aperto confligeretur ; idque ex omnibus partibus ab eo flagitabatur . <end>$$<start> There was now an opportunity for managing affairs successfully , nor did it escape Caesar , that an army daunted at suffering such a loss before their eyes , could not stand , especially as they were surrounded by our horse , and the engagement would take place on even and open ground . <end>
<start> Quod si iniquitatem loci timeret , datum iri tamen aliquo loco pugnandi facultatem , quod certe inde decedendum esset Afranio nec sine aqua permanere posset . <end>$$<start> But if he had any apprehensions from the disadvantage of the ground , that an opportunity would be given him of coming to battle in some other place : for that Afranius must certainly come down , and would not be able to remain there for want of water . <end>
<start> Caesar in eam spem venerat , se sine pugna et sine vulnere suorum rem conficere posse , quod re frumentaria adversarios interclusisset . <end>$$<start> Caesar had conceived hopes of ending the affair without an engagement , or without striking a blow , because he had cut off the enemy's supplies . <end>
<start> Cur etiam secundo proelio aliquos ex suis amitteret ? cur vulnerari pateretur optime de se meritos milites ? cur denique fortunam periclitaretur ? praesertim cum non minus esset imperatoris consilio superare quam gladio . <end>$$<start> Why should he hazard the loss of any of his men , even in a successful battle ? Why should he expose soldiers to be wounded , who had deserved so well of him ? Why , in short , should he tempt fortune ? especially when it was as much a general's duty to conquer by tactics as by the sword . <end>
<start> Movebatur etiam misericordia civium , quos interficiendos videbat ; quibus salvis atque incolumibus rem obtinere malebat . <end>$$<start> Besides , he was moved with compassion for those citizens , who , he foresaw , must fall : and he had rather gain his object without any loss or injury to them . <end>
<start> Hoc consilium Caesaris plerisque non probabatur : milites vero palam inter se loquebantur , quoniam talis occasio victoriae dimitteretur , etiam cum vellet Caesar , sese non esse pugnaturos . <end>$$<start> This resolution of Caesar was not generally approved of ; but the soldiers openly declared to each other that since such an opportunity of victory was let pass , they would not come to an engagement , even when Caesar should wish it . <end>
<start> Ille in sua sententia perseverat et paulum ex eo loco digreditur , ut timorem adversariis minuat . <end>$$<start> He persevered however in his resolution , and retired a little from that place to abate the enemy's fears . <end>
<start> Petreius atque Afranius oblata facultate in castra sese referunt . <end>$$<start> Petreius and Afranius , having got this opportunity , retired to their camp . <end>
<start> Caesar praesidiis montibus dispositis omni ad Hiberum intercluso itinere quam proxime potest hostium castris castra communit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having disposed parties on the mountains , and cut off all access to the Ebro , fortified his camp as close to the enemy as he could . <end>
<start> Postero die duces adversariorum perturbati , quod omnem rei frumentariae fluminisque Hiberi spem dimiserant , de reliquis rebus consultabant . <end>$$<start> The day following , the generals of his opponents , being alarmed that they had lost all prospect of supplies , and of access to the Ebro , consulted as to what other course they should take . <end>
<start> Erat unum iter , Ilerdam si reverti vellent ; alterum , si Tarraconem peterent . <end>$$<start> There were two roads , one to Ilerda , if they chose to return , the other to Tarraco , if they should march to it . <end>
<start> Haec consiliantibus eis nuntiantur aquatores ab equitatu premi nostro Qua re cognita crebras stationes disponunt equitum et cohortium alariarum legionariasque intericiunt cohortes vallumque ex castris ad aquam ducere incipiunt , ut intra munitionem et sine timore et sine stationibus aquari possent . <end>$$<start> While they were deliberating on these matters , intelligence was brought them that their watering parties were attacked by our horse : upon which information , they dispose several parties of horse and auxiliary foot along the road , and intermix some legionary cohorts , and begin to throw up a rampart from the camp to the water , that they might be able to procure water within their lines , both without fear , and without a guard . <end>
<start> Id opus inter se Petreius atque Afranius partiuntur ipsique perficiundi operis causa longius progrediuntur . <end>$$<start> Petreius and Afranius divided this task between themselves , and went in person to some distance from their camp for the purpose of seeing it accomplished . <end>
<start> Quorum discessu liberam nacti milites colloquiorum facultatem vulgo procedunt , et quem quisque in castris notum aut municipem habebat conquirit atque evocat . <end>$$<start> The soldiers having obtained by their absence a free opportunity of conversing with each other , came out in great numbers , and inquired each for whatever acquaintance or fellow-citizen he had in our camp , and invited him to him . <end>
<start> Primum agunt gratias omnibus , quod sibi perterritis pridie pepercissent : eorum se beneficio vivere Deinde de imperatoris fide quaerunt , rectene se illi sint commissuri , et quod non ab initio fecerint armaque cum hominibus necessariis et consanguineis contulerint , queruntur . <end>$$<start> First they returned them general thanks for sparing them the day before , when they were greatly terrified , and acknowledged that they were alive through their kindness ; then they inquired about the honor of our general , and whether they could with safety intrust themselves to him ; and declared their sorrow that they had not done so in the beginning , and that they had taken up arms against their relations and kinsmen . <end>
<start> His provocati sermonibus fidem ab imperatore de Petreii atque Afranii vita petunt , ne quod in se scelus concepisse neu suos prodidisse videantur . <end>$$<start> Encouraged by these conferences , they desired the general's parole for the lives of Petreius and Afranius , that they might not appear guilty of a crime , in having betrayed their generals . <end>
<start> Quibus confirmatis rebus se statim signa translaturos confirmant legatosque de pace primorum ordinum centuriones ad Caesarem mittunt . <end>$$<start> When they were assured of obtaining their demands , they promised that they would immediately remove their standards , and sent centurions of the first rank as deputies to treat with Caesar about a peace . <end>
<start> Interim alii suos in castra invitandi causa adducunt , alii ab suis abducuntur , adeo ut una castra iam facta ex binis viderentur ; compluresque tribuni militum et centuriones ad Caesarem veniunt seque ei commendant . <end>$$<start> In the mean time some of them invite their acquaintances , and bring them to their camp , others are brought away by their friends , so that the two camps seemed to be united into one , and several of the tribunes and centurions came to Caesar , and paid their respects to him . <end>
<start> Idem hoc fit a principibus Hispaniae , quos evocaverant et secum in castris habebant obsidum loco . <end>$$<start> The same was done by some of the nobility of Spain , whom they summoned to their assistance , and kept in their camp as hostages . <end>
<start> Hi suos notos hospitesque quaerebant , per quem quisque eorum aditum commendationis haberet ad Caesarem . <end>$$<start> They inquired after their acquaintance and friends , by whom each might have the means of being recommended to Caesar . <end>
<start> Afranii etiam filius adulescens de sua ac parentis sui salute cum Caesare per Sulpicium legatum agebat . <end>$$<start> Even Afranius's son , a young man , endeavored , by means of Sulpitius the lieutenant , to make terms for his own and his father's life . <end>
<start> Erant plena laetitia et gratulatione omnia , eorum , qui tanta pericula vitasse , et eorum , qui sine vulnere tantas res confecisse videbantur , magnumque fructum suae pristinae lenitatis omnium iudicio Caesar ferebat , consiliumque eius a cunctis probabatur . <end>$$<start> Every place was filled with mirth and congratulations ; in the one army , because they thought they had escaped so impending danger ; in the other , because they thought they had completed so important a matter without blows ; and Caesar , in every man's judgment , reaped the advantage of his former lenity , and his conduct was applauded by all . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus nuntiatis Afranius ab instituto opere discedit seque in castra recipit , sic paratus , ut videbatur , ut , quicumque accidisset casus , hunc quieto et aequo animo ferret . <end>$$<start> When these circumstances were announced to Afranius , he left the work which he had begun , and returned to his camp , determined as it appeared , whatever should be the event , to bear it with an even and steady mind . <end>
<start> Petreius vero non deserit sese Armat familiam ; cum hac et praetoria cohorte cetratorum barbarisque equitibus paucis , beneficiariis suis , quos suae custodiae causa habere consuerat , improviso ad vallum advolat , colloquia militum interrumpit , nostros repellit a castris , quos deprendit interficit . <end>$$<start> Petreius did not neglect himself ; he armed his domestics ; with them and the praetorian cohort of Spaniards , and a few foreign horse , his dependents , whom he commonly kept near him to guard his person , he suddenly flew to the rampart , interrupted the conferences of the soldiers , drove our men from the camp , and put to death as many as he caught . <end>
<start> Reliqui coeunt inter se et repentino periculo exterriti sinistras sagis involvunt gladiosque destringunt atque ita se a cetratis equitibusque defendunt castrorum propinquitate confisi seque in castra recipiunt et ab eis cohortibus , quae erant in statione ad portas , defenduntur . <end>$$<start> The rest formed into a body , and being alarmed by the unexpected danger , wrapped their left arms in their cloaks , and drew their swords , and in this manner , depending on the nearness of their camp , defended themselves against the Spaniards , and the horse , and made good their retreat to the camp , where they were protected by the cohorts which were on guard . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus confectis flens Petreius manipulos circumit militesque appellat , neu se neu Pompeium , imperatorem suum , adversariis ad supplicium tradant , obsecrat . <end>$$<start> Petreius , after accomplishing this , went round every maniple , calling the soldiers by their names , and entreating with tears that they would not give up him and their absent general Pompey , as a sacrifice to the vengeance of their enemies . <end>
<start> Fit celeriter concursus in praetorium Postulat , ut iurent omnes se exercitum ducesque non deserturos neque prodituros neque sibi separatim a reliquis consilium capturos . <end>$$<start> Immediately they ran in crowds to the general's pavilion , when he required them all to take an oath that they would not desert nor betray the army nor the generals , nor form any design distinct from the general interest . <end>
<start> Princeps in haec verba iurat ipse ; idem iusiurandum adigit Afranium ; subsequuntur tribuni militum centurionesque ; centuriatim producti milites idem iurant . <end>$$<start> He himself swore first to the tenor of those words , and obliged Afranius to take the same oath . <end>
<start> Edicunt , penes quem quisque sit Caesaris miles , ut producatur : productos palam in praetorio interficiunt . <end>$$<start> The tribunes and centurions followed their example ; the soldiers were brought out by centuries , and took the same oath . <end>
<start> Sic terror oblatus a ducibus , crudelitas in supplicio , nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit . <end>$$<start> Thus the terror raised by the generals , the cruelty of the punishments , the new obligation of an oath , removed all hopes of surrender for the present , changed the soldiers' minds , and reduced matters to the former state of war . <end>
<start> Caesar , qui milites adversariorum in castra per tempus colloquii venerant , summa diligentia conquiri et remitti iubet . <end>$$<start> Caesar ordered the enemy's soldiers , who had come into his camp to hold a conference , to be searched for with the strictest diligence , and sent back . <end>
<start> Sed ex numero tribunorum militum centurionumque nonnulli sua voluntate apud eum remanserunt . <end>$$<start> But of the tribunes and centurions , several voluntarily remained with him , and he afterward treated them with great respect . <end>
<start> Quos ille postea magno in honore habuit ; centuriones in priores ordines , equites Romanos in tribunicium restituit honorem . <end>$$<start> The centurions he promoted to higher ranks , and conferred on the Roman knights the honor of tribunes . <end>
<start> Premebantur Afraniani pabulatione , aquabantur aegre . <end>$$<start> Afranius's men were distressed in foraging , and procured water with difficulty . <end>
<start> Frumenti copiam legionarii nonnullam habebant , quod dierum XXII ab Ilerda frumentum iussi erant efferre , cetrati auxiliaresque nullam , quorum erant et facultates ad parandum exiguae et corpora insueta ad onera portanda . <end>$$<start> The legionary soldiers had a tolerable supply of corn , because they had beef ordered to bring from Ilerda sufficient to last twenty-two days ; the Spanish and auxiliary forces had none , for they had but few opportunities of procuring any , and their bodies were not accustomed to bear burdens ; and therefore a great number of them came over to Caesar every day . <end>
<start> Itaque magnus eorum cotidie numerus ad Caesarem perfugiebat In his erat angustiis res Sed ex propositis consiliis duobus explicitius videbatur Ilerdam reverti , quod ibi paulum frumenti reliquerant . <end>$$<start> Their affairs were under these difficulties ; but of the two schemes proposed , the most expedient seemed to be to return to Ilerda , because they had left some corn there ; and there they hoped to decide on a plan for their future conduct . <end>
<start> Ibi se reliquum consilium explicaturos confidebant Tarraco aberat longius ; quo spatio plures rem posse casus recipere intellegebant . <end>$$<start> Tarraco lay at a greater distance ; and in such a space they knew affairs might admit of many changes . <end>
<start> Hoc probato consilio ex castris proficiscuntur . <end>$$<start> Their design having met with approbation , they set out from their camp . <end>
<start> Caesar equitatu praemisso , qui novissimum agmen carperet atque impediret , ipse cum legionibus subsequitur . <end>$$<start> Caesar having sent forward his cavalry , to annoy and retard their rear , followed close after with his legions . <end>
<start> Nullum intercedebat tempus , quin extremi cum equitibus proeliarentur . <end>$$<start> Not a moment passed in which their rear was not engaged with our horse . <end>
<start> Si mons erat ascendendus , facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat , quod ex locis superioribus , qui antecesserant , suos ascendentes protegebant ; cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat , neque ei , qui antecesserant , morantibus opem ferre poterant , equites vero ex loco superiore in aversos tela coniciebant , tum magno erat in periculo res . <end>$$<start> When they approached a valley or declivity , and the advanced men could not impart assistance to the tardy , our horse threw their darts at them from the rising grounds with advantage ; then their affairs were in a perilous situation ; the only plan left was , that whenever they came near such places , they should give orders to the legions to halt , and by a violent effort repulse our horse ; and these being forced to give way , they should suddenly , with the utmost speed , run all together down to the valley , and having passed it , should face about again on the next hill . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur , ut , cum eiusmodi locis esset appropinquatum , legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum repellerent , eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in valles universi demitterent atque ita transgressi rursus in locis superioribus consisterent . <end>$$<start> For so far were they from deriving any assistance from their horse (of which they had a large number) , that they were obliged to receive them into the center of their army , and themselves protect them , as they were daunted by former battles . <end>
<start> Tali dum pugnatur modo , lente atque paulatim proceditur , crebroque , ut sint auxilio suis , subsistunt ; ut tum accidit . <end>$$<start> While skirmishes were fought in this manner , they advanced but slowly and gradually , and frequently halted to help their rear , as then happened . <end>
<start> Milia enim progressi IIII vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu montem excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra muniunt neque iumentis onera deponunt . <end>$$<start> For having advanced four miles , and being very much harassed by our horse , they took post on a high mountain , and there in trenched themselves on the front only , facing the enemy ; and did not take their baggage off their cattle . <end>
<start> Ubi Caesaris castra posita tabernaculaque constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa animum adverterunt , sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta eiusdem diei et spem nacti morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter facere incipiunt . <end>$$<start> When they perceived that Caesar's camp was pitched , and the tents fixed up , and his horse sent out to forage , they suddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day , and , having hopes that we should be delayed by the absence of our horse , they began to march , which Caesar perceiving , followed them with the legions that remained . <end>
<start> Qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis legionibus subsequitur , praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortes relinquit ; hora x subsequi pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet . <end>$$<start> He left a few cohorts to guard his baggage , and ordered the foragers to be called home at the tenth hour , and the horse to follow him . <end>
<start> Celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur Pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen , adeo ut paene terga convertant , compluresque milites , etiam nonnulli centuriones , interficiuntur . <end>$$<start> The horse shortly returned to their daily duty on march , and charged the rear so vigorously , that they almost forced them to fly ; and several privates and some centurions were killed . <end>
<start> Instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum imminebat . <end>$$<start> The main body of Caesar's army was at hand , and universal ruin threatened them . <end>
<start> Tum vero neque ad explorandum idoneum locum castris neque ad progrediendum data facultate consistunt necessario et procul ab aqua et natura iniquo loco castra ponunt . <end>$$<start> Then indeed , not having opportunity either to choose a convenient position for their camp , or to march forward , they were obliged to halt , and to encamp at a distance from water , and on ground naturally unfavorable . <end>
<start> Sed isdem de causis Caesar , quae supra sunt demonstratae , proelio non lacessit et eo die tabernacula statui passus non est , quo paratiores essent ad insequendum omnes , sive noctu sive interdiu erumperent . <end>$$<start> But for the reasons already given , Caesar did not attack them , nor suffer a tent to be pitched that day , that his men might be the readier to pursue them whether they attempted to run off by night or by day . <end>
<start> Illi animadverso vitio castrorum tota nocte munitiones proferunt castraque castris convertunt . <end>$$<start> Observing the defect in their position , they spent the whole night in extending their work , and turning their camp to ours . <end>
<start> Prima nocte aquandi causa nemo egreditur ex castris ; proximo die praesidio in castris relicto universas ad aquam copias educunt , pabulatum emittitur nemo . <end>$$<start> The next day , they left a guard in the camp , and led out all their forces to water : but not a person was sent to look for forage . <end>
<start> His eos suppliciis male haberi Caesar et necessariam subire deditionem quam proelio decertare malebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar was more desirous that they should be humbled by these means , and forced to come to terms , than decide the contest by battle . <end>
<start> Conatur tamen eos vallo fossaque circummunire , ut quam maxime repentinas eorum eruptiones demoretur ; quo necessario descensuros existimabat . <end>$$<start> Yet he endeavored to surround them with a wall and trench , that he might be able to check their most sudden sally , to which he imagined that they must have recourse . <end>
<start> Illi et inopia pabuli adducti et , quo essent expeditiores , omnia sarcinaria iumenta interfici iubent . <end>$$<start> Hereupon , urged by want of fodder , that they might be the readier for a march , they killed all their baggage cattle . <end>
<start> In his operibus consiliisque biduum consumitur ; tertio die magna iam pars operis Caesaris processerat . <end>$$<start> In this work , and the deliberations on it , two days were spent . <end>
<start> Illi impediendae reliquae munitionis causa hora circiter VIIII signo dato legiones educunt aciemque sub castris instruunt . <end>$$<start> To interrupt his progress , they drew out their legions about the eighth hour , by a certain signal , and placed them in order of battle before their camp . <end>
<start> Caesar ab opere legiones revocat , equitatum omnem convenire iubet , aciem instruit ; contra opinionen enim militum famamque omnium videri proelium defugisse magnum detrimentum afferebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar calling his legions off from their work , and ordering the horse to hold themselves in readiness , marshaled his army : for to appear to decline an engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldiers and the general voice , would have been attended with great disadvantage . <end>
<start> Sed eisdem de causis , quae sunt cognitae , quo minus dimicare vellet , movebatur , atque hoc etiam magis , quod spatii brevitate etiam in fugam coniectis adversariis non multum ad summam victoria iuvare poterat . <end>$$<start> But for the reasons already known , he was dissuaded from wishing to engage , and the more especially , because the short space between the camps , even if the enemy were put to flight , would not contribute much to a decisive victory ; for the two camps were not distant from each other above two thousand feet . <end>
<start> Non enim amplius pedum milibus duobus ab castris castra distabant ; hinc duas partes acies occupabant duae ; tertia vacabat ad incursum atque impetum militum relicta . <end>$$<start> Two parts of this were occupied by the armies , and one third left for the soldiers to charge and make their attack . <end>
<start> Si proelium committeretur , propinquitas castrorum celerem superatis ex fuga receptum dabat . <end>$$<start> If a battle should be begun , the nearness of the camps would afford a ready retreat to the conquered party in the flight . <end>
<start> Acies erat Afraniana duplex legionum V ; tertium in subsidiis locum alariae cohortes obtinebant ; Caesaris triplex ; sed primam aciem quaternae cohortes ex V legionibus tenebant , has subsidiariae ternae et rursus aliae totidem suae cuiusque legionis subsequebantur ; sagittarii funditoresque media continebantur acie , equitatus latera cingebat . <end>$$<start> Afranius's five legions were drawn up in two lines , the auxiliary cohorts formed the third line , and acted as reserves Caesar had three lines , four cohorts out of each of the five legions formed the first line . <end>
<start> Tali instructa acie tenere uterque propositum videbatur : Caesar , ne nisi coactus proelium committeret ; ille , ut opera Caesaris impediret . <end>$$<start> The slingers and archers were stationed in the center of the line ; the cavalry closed the flanks . <end>
<start> Qua re animadversa Caesar Germanos levis armaturae equitumque partem flumen traicit crebrasque in ripis custodias disponit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having perceived this , sent some light armed Germans and a party of horse across the river , and disposed several parties along the banks to guard them . <end>
<start> Tandem omnibus rebus obsessi , quartum iam diem sine pabulo retentis iumentis , aquae , lignorum , frumenti inopia colloquium petunt et id , si fieri possit , semoto a militibus loco . <end>$$<start> At length , beset on all sides , their cattle having been four days without fodder , and having no water , wood , or corn , they beg a conference ; and that , if possible , in a place remote from the soldiers . <end>
<start> Ubi id a Caesare negatum et , palam si colloqui vellent , concessum est , datur obsidis loco Caesari filius Afranii . <end>$$<start> When this was refused by Caesar , but a public interview offered if they chose it , Afranius's son was given as a hostage to Caesar . <end>
<start> Venitur in eum locum , quem Caesar delegit . <end>$$<start> They met in the place appointed by Caesar . <end>
<start> Audiente utroque exercitu loquitur Afranius : non esse aut ipsis aut militibus succensendum , quod fidem erga imperatorem suum Gnaeus Pompeium conservare voluerint . <end>$$<start> In the hearing of both armies Afranius spoke thus : That Caesar ought not to be displeased either with him or his soldiers , for wishing to preserve their attachment to their general , Cneius Pompey . <end>
<start> Sed satis iam fecisse officio satisque supplicii tulisse perpessos omnium rerum inopiam ; nunc vero paene ut feras circummunitos prohiberi aqua , prohiberi ingressu , neque corpore dolorem neque animo ignominiam ferre posse Itaque se victos confiteri ; orare atque obsecrare , si qui locus misericordiae relinquatur , ne ad ultimum supplicium progredi necesse habeat . <end>$$<start> That they had now sufficiently discharged their duty to him , and had suffered punishment enough , in having endured the want of every necessary : but now , pent up almost like wild beasts , they were prevented from procuring water , and prevented from walking abroad ; and were not able to bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace : but confessed themselves vanquished : and begged and entreated , if there was any room left for mercy , that they should not be necessitated to suffer the most severe penalties . <end>
<start> Haec quam potest demississime et subiectissime exponit . <end>$$<start> These sentiments were delivered in the most submissive and humble language . <end>
<start> Ad ea Caesar respondit : nulli omnium has partes vel querimoniae vel miserationis minus convenisse Reliquos enim omnes officium suum praestitisse : se , qui etiam bona condicione , et loco et tempore aequo , confligere noluerit , ut quam integerrima essent ad pacem omnia ; exercitum suum , qui iniuria etiam accepta suisque interfectis , quos in sua potestate habuerit , conservarit et texerit ; illius denique exercitus milites , qui per se de concilianda pace egerint ; qua in re omnium suorum vitae consulendum putarint . <end>$$<start> Caesar replied , That either to complain or sue for mercy became no man less than him : for that every other person had done their duty : himself , in having declined to engage on favorable terms , in an advantageous situation and time , that all things tending to a peace might be totally unembarrassed : his army , in having preserved and protected the men whom they had in their power , notwithstanding the injuries which they had received , and the murder of their comrades ; and even Afranius's soldiers , who of themselves treated about concluding a peace , by which they thought that they would secure the lives of all . <end>
<start> Sic omnium ordinum partes in misericordia constitisse : ipsos duces a pace abhorruisse ; eos neque colloquii neque indutiarum iura servasse et homines imperitos et per colloquium deceptos crudelissime interfecisse Accidisse igitur his , quod plerumque hominum nimia pertinacia atque arrogantia accidere soleat , uti eo recurrant et id cupidissime petant , quod paulo ante contempserint . <end>$$<start> Thus , that the parties on both sides inclined to mercy : that the generals only were averse to peace : that they paid no regard to the laws either of conference or truce ; and had most inhumanly put to death ignorant persons , who were deceived by a conference : that therefore , they had met that fate which usually befalls men from excessive obstinacy and arrogance ; and were obliged to have recourse , and most earnestly desire that which they had shortly before disdained . <end>
<start> Neque nunc se illorum humilitate neque aliqua temporis opportunitate postulare , quibus rebus opes augeantur suae ; sed eos exercitus , quos contra se multos iam annos aluerint , velle dimitti Neque enim sex legiones alia de causa missas in Hispaniam septimamque ibi conscriptam neque tot tantasque classes paratas neque submissos duces rei militaris peritos Nihil horum ad pacandas Hispanias , nihil ad usum provinciae provisum , quae propter diuturnitatem pacis nullum auxilium desiderarit Omnia haec iam pridem contra se parari ; in se novi generis imperia constitui , ut idem ad portas urbanis praesideat rebus et duas bellicosissimas provincias absens tot annis obtineat ; in se iura magistratuum commutari , ne ex praetura et consulatu , ut semper , sed per paucos probati et electi in provincias mittantur ; in se etiam aetatis excusationem nihil valere , cum superioribus bellis probati ad obtinendos exercitus evocentur ; in se uno non servari , quod sit omnibus datum semper imperatoribus , ut rebus feliciter gestis aut cum honore aliquo aut certe sine ignominia domum revertantur exercitumque dimittant . <end>$$<start> That for his part , he would not avail himself of their present humiliation , or his present advantage , to require terms by which his power might be increased , but only that those armies , which they had maintained for so many years to oppose him , should be disbanded : for six legions had been sent into Spain , and a seventh raised there , and many and powerful fleets provided , and generals of great military experience sent to command them , for no other purpose than to oppose him : that none of these measures were adopted to keep the Spains in peace , or for the use of the province , which , from the length of the peace , stood in need of no such aid ; that all these things were long since designed against him ; that against him a new sort of government was established , that the same person should be at the gates of Rome , to direct the affairs of the city ; and though absent , have the government of two most warlike provinces for so many years : that against him the laws of the magistrates had been altered ; that the late praetors and consuls should not be sent to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom , but persons approved of and chosen by a faction . <end>
<start> Id vero militibus fuit pergratum et iucundum , ut ex ipsa significatione cognosci potuit , ut , qui aliquid iusti incommodi exspectavissent , ultro praemium missionis ferrent . <end>$$<start> It was very acceptable and agreeable to Afranius's soldiers , as might be easily known from their signs of joy , that they who expected some injury after this defeat , should obtain without solicitation the reward of a dismissal . <end>
<start> Nam cum de loco et tempore eius rei controversia inferretur , et voce et manibus universi ex vallo , ubi constiterant , significare coeperunt , ut statim dimitterentur , neque omni interposita fide firmum esse posse , si in aliud tempus differretur . <end>$$<start> After a short debate on either side , it was brought to this issue : that those who had any settlement or possession in Spain , should be immediately discharged : the rest at the river Var . <end>
<start> Caesar ex eo tempore , dum ad flumen Varum veniatur , se frumentum daturum pollicetur . <end>$$<start> Caesar promised to supply them with corn from the present time till they arrived at the river Var . <end>
<start> Addit etiam , ut , quod quisque eorum in bello amiserit , quae sint penes milites suos , eis , qui amiserint , restituatur ; militibus aequa facta aestimatione pecuniam pro his rebus dissolvit . <end>$$<start> He further adds , that whatever any of them lost in the war , which was in the possession of his soldiers , should be restored to those that lost them . <end>
<start> Quascumque postea controversias inter se milites habuerunt , sua sponte ad Caesarem in ius adierunt . <end>$$<start> To his soldiers he made a recompense in money for those things , a just valuation being made . <end>
<start> Petreius atque Afranius cum stipendium ab legionibus paene seditione facta flagitarentur , cuius illi diem nondum venisse dicerent , Caesar ut cognosceret , postulatum est , eoque utrique , quod statuit , contenti fuerunt . <end>$$<start> Whatever disputes Afranius's soldiers had afterward among themselves , they voluntarily submitted to Caesar's decision . <end>
<start> Parte circiter tertia exercitus eo biduo dimissa duas legiones suas antecedere , reliquas subsequi iussit , ut non longo inter se spatio castra facerent , eique negotio Quintus Fufium Calenum legatum praeficit . <end>$$<start> Afranius and Petreius , when pay was demanded by the legions , a sedition almost breaking out , asserted that the time had not yet come , and required that Caesar should take cognizance of it ; and both parties were content with his decision . <end>
<start> Hoc eius praescripto ex Hispania ad Varum flumen est iter factum , atque ibi reliqua pars exercitus dimissa est . <end>$$<start> About a third part of their army being dismissed in two days , Caesar ordered two of his legions , to go before , the rest to follow the vanquished enemy ; that they should encamp at a small distance from each other . <end>
<start> Dum haec in Hispania geruntur , Gaius Trebonius legatus , qui ad oppugnationem Massiliae relictus erat , duabus ex partibus aggerrem , vineas turresque ad oppidum agere instituit Una erat proxima portui navalibusque , altera ad portam , qua est aditus ex Gallia atque Hispania , ad id mare , quod adiacet ad ostium Rhodani . <end>$$<start> While these things were going forward in Spain , Caius Trebonius , Caesar's lieutenant , who had been left to conduct the assault of Massilia , began to raise a mound , vineae , and turrets against the town , on two sides ; one of which was next the harbor and docks , the other on that part where there is a passage from Gaul and Spain to that sea which forces itself up the mouth of the Rhone . <end>
<start> Massilia enim fere tribus ex oppidi partibus mari alluitur ; reliqua quarta est , quae aditum habeat ab terra . <end>$$<start> For Massilia is washed almost on three sides by the sea , the remaining fourth part is the only side which has access by land . <end>
<start> Huius quoque spatii pars ea , quae ad arcem pertinet , loci natura et valle altissima munita longam et difficilem habet oppugnationem . <end>$$<start> A part even of this space , which reaches to the fortress , being fortified by the nature of the country , and a very deep valley , required a long and difficult siege . <end>
<start> Ad ea perficienda opera Gaius Trebonius magnam iumentorum atque hominum multitudinem ex omni provincia vocat ; vimina materiamque comportari iubet . <end>$$<start> To accomplish these works , Caius Trebonius sends for a great quantity of carriages and men from the whole Province , and orders hurdles and materials to be furnished . <end>
<start> Quibus comparatis rebus aggerem in altitudinem pedum LXXX exstruit . <end>$$<start> These things being provided , he raised a mound eighty feet in height . <end>
<start> Sed tanti erant antiquitus in oppido omnium rerum ad bellum apparatus tantaque multitudo tormentorum , ut eorum vim nullae contextae viminibus vineae sustinere possent . <end>$$<start> But so great a store of every thing necessary for a war had been a long time before laid up in the town , and so great a number of engines , that no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force . <end>
<start> Asseres enim pedum XII cuspidibus praefixi atque hi maximis bllistis missi per IIII ordines cratium in terra defigebantur . <end>$$<start> Therefore the arches of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot thick , fastened together , and under this the materials of the agger were handed from one to another . <end>
<start> Antecedebat testudo pedum LX aequandi loci causa facta item ex fortissimis lignis , convoluta omnibus rebus , quibus ignis iactus et lapides defendi possent . <end>$$<start> But the greatness of the works , the height of the wall and towers , and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works . <end>
<start> Sed magnitudo operum , altitudo muri atque turrium , multitudo tormentorum omnem administrationem tardabat . <end>$$<start> Besides , frequent sallies were made from the town by the Albici , and fire was thrown on our mound and turrets . <end>
<start> Interim L Nasidius , a Gnaeus Pompeio cum classe navium XVI , in quibus paucae erant aeratae , Lucius Domitio Massiliensibusque subsidio missus , freto Siciliae imprudente atque inopinante Curione pervehitur appulsisque Messanam navibus atque inde propter repentinum terrorem principum ac senatus fuga facta navem ex navalibus eorum deducit . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , Lucius Nasidius , being sent by Cneius Pompey with a fleet of sixteen sail , a few of which had beaks of brass , to the assistance of Lucius Domitius and the Massilians , passed the straits of Sicily without the knowledge or expectation of Curio , and , putting with his fleet into Messana , and making the nobles and senate take flight with the sudden terror , carried off one of their ships out of dock . <end>
<start> Hac adiuncta ad reliquas naves cursum Massiliam versus perficit praemissaque clam navicula Domitium Massiliensesque de suo adventu certiores facit eosque magnopere hortatur , ut rursus cum Bruti classe additis suis auxiliis confligant . <end>$$<start> Having joined this to his other ships , he made good his voyage to Massilia , and having sent in a galley privately , acquaints Domitius and the Massilians of his arrival , and earnestly encourages them to hazard another battle with Brutus's fleet with the addition of his aid . <end>
<start> Massilienses post superius incommodum veteres ad eundem numerum ex navalibus productas naves refecerant summaque industria armaverant (remigum , gubernatorum magna copia suppetebat) piscatoriasque adiecerant atque contexerant , ut essent ab ictu telorum remiges tuti ; has sagittariis tormentisque compleverunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians , since their former loss , had brought the same number of old ships from the docks , and had repaired and fitted them out with great industry : they had a large supply of seamen and pilots . <end>
<start> Tali modo instructa classe omnium seniorum , matrum familiae , virginum precibus et fletu excitati , extremo tempore civitati subvenirent , non minore animo ac fiducia , quam ante dimicaverant , naves conscendunt . <end>$$<start> They had got several fishing-smacks , and covered them over , that the seamen might be secure against darts : these they filled with archers and engines . <end>
<start> Communi enim fit vitio naturae , ut inusitatis atque incognitis rebus magis confidamus vehementiusque exterreamur ; ut tum accidit . <end>$$<start> With a fleet thus appointed , encouraged by the entreaties and tears of all the old men , matrons , and virgins to succor the state in this hour of distress , they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had fought before . <end>
<start> Nacti idoneum ventum ex portu exeunt et Tauroenta , quod est castellum Massilensium , ad Nasidium perveniunt ibique naves expediunt rursusque se ad confligendum animo confirmant et consilia communicant . <end>$$<start> Having got a fair wind , they sailed out of port and went to Nasidius to Taurois , which is a fort belonging to the Massilians , and there ranged their fleet and again encouraged each other to engage and communicated their plan of operation . <end>
<start> Dextra pars attribuitur Massiliensibus , sinistra Nasidio . <end>$$<start> The command of the right division was given to the Massilians , that of the left to Nasidius . <end>
<start> Eodem Brutus contendit aucto navium numero Nam ad eas , quae factae erant Arelate per Caesarem , captivae Massiliensium accesserant sex . <end>$$<start> Brutus sailed to the same place with an augmented fleet ; for to those made by Caesar at Arelas were added six ships taken from the Massilians , which he had refitted since the last battle and had furnished with every necessary . <end>
<start> Has superioribus diebus refecerat atque omnibus rebus instruxerat Itaque suos cohortatus , quos integros superarissent ut victos contemnerent , plenus spei bonae atque animi adversus eos proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , having encouraged his men to despise a vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken , he advanced against them full of confidence and spirit . <end>
<start> Facile erat ex castris Gaius Trebonii atque omnibus superioribus locis prospicere in urbem , ut omnis iuventus , quae in oppido remanserat , omnesque superioris aetatis cum liberis atque uxoribus ex publicis locis custodiisque aut e muro ad caelum manus tenderent , aut templa deorum immortalium adirent et ante simulacra proiecti victoriam ab diis ecerent . <end>$$<start> From Trebonius's camp and all the higher grounds it was easy to see into the town-how all the youth which remained in it , and all persons of more advanced years , with their wives and children , and the public guards , were either extending their hands from the wall to the heavens , or were repairing to the temples of the immortal gods , and prostrating themselves before their images , were entreating them to grant them victory . <end>
<start> Neque erat quisquam omnium , quin in eius diei casu suarum omnium fortunarum eventum consistere existimaret Nam et honesti ex iuventute et cuiusque aetatis amplissimi nominatim evocati atque obsecrati naves conscenderant ut , si quid adversi accidisset , ne ad conandum quidem sibi quicquam reliqui fore viderent ; si superavissent , vel domesticis opibus vel externis auxiliis de salute urbis confiderent . <end>$$<start> Nor was there a single person who did not imagine that his future fortune depended on the issue of that day ; for the choice of their youth and the most respectable of every age , being expressly invited and solicited , had gone on board the fleet , that if any adverse fate should befall them they might see that nothing was left for them to attempt , and , if they proved victorious , they might have hopes of preserving the city , either by their internal resources or by foreign assistance . <end>
<start> Commisso proelio Massiliensibus res nulla ad virtutem defuit ; sed memores eorum praeceptorum , quae paulo ante ab suis aeceperant , hoc animo decertabant , ut nullum aliud tempus ad conandum habituri viderentur , et quibus in pugna vitae periculum accideret , non ita multo se reliquorum civium fatum antecedere existimareut , quibus urbe capta eadem esset belli fortuna patienda . <end>$$<start> When the battle was begun , no effort of valor was wanting to the Massilians , but , mindful of the instructions which they had a little before received from their friends , they fought with such spirit as if they supposed that they would never have another opportunity to attempt a defense , and as if they believed that those whose lives should be endangered in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the citizens , who , if the city was taken , must undergo the same fortune of war . <end>
<start> Diductisque nostris paulatim navibus et artificio gubernatorum et mobilitati navium locus dabatur , et si quando nostri facultatem nacti ferreis manibus iniectis navem religaverant , undique suis laborantibus succurrebant . <end>$$<start> Our ships being at some distance from each other , room was allowed both for the skill of their pilots and the maueuvering of their ships ; and if at any time ours , gaining an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their ships , grappled with them , from all parts they assisted those who were distressed . <end>
<start> Neque vero coniuncti Albici comminus pugnando deficiebant neque multum cedebant virtute nostris . <end>$$<start> Nor , after being joined by the Albici , did they decline coming to close engagement , nor were they much inferior to our men in valor . <end>
<start> Simul ex minoribus navibus magna vis eminus missa telorum multa nostris de improviso imprudentibus atque impeditis vulnera inferebant Conspicataeque naves triremes duae navem D Bruti , quae ex insigni facile agnosci poterat , duabus ex partibus sese in eam incitaverant Sed tantum re provisa Brutus celeritate navis enisus est , ut parvo momento antecederet . <end>$$<start> At the same time , showers of darts , thrown from a distance from the lesser ships , suddenly inflicted several wounds on our men when off their guard and otherwise engaged ; and two of their three-decked galleys ; having descried the ship of Decimus Brutus , which could be easily distinguished by its flag , rowed up against him with great violence from opposite sides : but Brutus , seeing into their designs , by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with such address as to get clear , though only by a moment . <end>
<start> Illae adeo graviter inter se incitatae conflixerunt , ut vehementissime utraque ex concursu laborarent , altera vero praefracto rostro tota collabefieret Qua re animadversa , quae proximae ei loco ex Bruti classe naves erant , in eas impeditas impetum faciunt celeriterque ambas deprimunt . <end>$$<start> From the velocity of their motion they struck against each other with such violence that they were both excessively injured by the shock ; the beak , indeed , of one of them being broken off , the whole ship was ready to founder , which circumstance being observed , the ships of Brutus's fleet , which were nearest that station , attack them when in this disorder and sink them both . <end>
<start> Sed Nasidianae naves nullo usui fuerunt celeriterque pugna excesserunt ; non enim has aut conspectus patriae aut propinquorum praecepta ad extremum vitae periculum adire cogebant . <end>$$<start> But Nasidius's ships were of no use , and soon left the fight ; for the sight of their country , or the entreaties of their relations , did not urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives . <end>
<start> Itaque ex eo numero navium nulla desiderata est : ex Massiliensium classe V sunt depressae , IV captae , una cum Nasidianis profugit ; quae omnes citeriorem Hispaniam petiverunt At ex reliquis una praemissa Massiliam huius nuntii perferendi gratia cum iam appropinquaret urbi , omnis sese multitudo ad cognoscendum effudit , et re cognita tantus luctus excepit , ut urbs ab hostibus capta eodem vestigio videretur . <end>$$<start> Therefore , of the number of the ships not one was lost : of the fleet of the Massilians five were sunk , four taken , and one ran off with Nasidius : all that escaped made the best of their way to Hither Spain , but one of the rest was sent forward to Massilia for the purpose of bearing this intelligence , and when it came near the city , the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings , and , on being informed of the event , were so oppressed with grief , that one would have imagined that the city had been taken by an enemy at the same moment . <end>
<start> Massilienses tamen nihilo secius ad defensionem urbis reliqua apparare coeperunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians , however , began to make the necessary preparations for the defense of their city with unwearied energy . <end>
<start> Est animadveraum ab legionibus , qui dextram partem operis administrabant , ex crebris hostium eruptionibus magno sibi ease praesidio posse , si ibi pro castello ac receptaculo turrim ex latere sub muro fecissent Quam primo ad repentinos incursus humilem parvamque fecerunt . <end>$$<start> The legionary soldiers who had the management of the works on the right side , observed , from the frequent sallies of the enemy , that it might prove a great protection to them to build a turret of brick under the wall for a fort and place of refuge , which they at first built low and small , to guard them against sudden attacks . <end>
<start> Huc se referebant ; hinc , si qua maior oppresserat vis , propugnabant ; hinc ad repellendum et prosequendum hostem procurrebant . <end>$$<start> To it they retreated , and from it they made defense if any superior force attacked them ; and from it they sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy . <end>
<start> Ubi turris altitudo perducta est ad contabulationem , eam in parietes instruxerunt , ita ut capita tignorum extrema parietum structura tegerentur , ne quid emineret , ubi ignis hostium adhaeresceret . <end>$$<start> When the turret was raised to the height for flooring , they laid it on the walls in such a manner that the ends of the joists were covered by the outer face of the wall , that nothing should project to which the enemy's fire might adhere . <end>
<start> Ita tuto ac sine ullo vulnere ac periculo sex tabulata exstruxerunt fenestrasque , quibus in locis visum est , ad tormenta mittenda in struendo reliquerunt . <end>$$<start> In this manner , securely and without a blow or danger , they raised it six stories high , and in laying the materials left loop-holes in such places as they thought proper for working their engines . <end>
<start> Ubi ex ea turri , quae circum essent opera , tueri se posse confisi sunt , musculum pedes LX longum ex materia bipedali , quem a turri latericia ad hostium turrim murumque perducerent , facere instituerunt ; cuius musculi haec erat forma . <end>$$<start> When they were confident that they could protect the works which lay around from this turret , they resolved to build a musculus , sixty feet long , of timber , two feet square , and to extend it from the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall . <end>
<start> Duae primum trabes in solo aeque longae distantes inter se pedes IIII collocantur , inque eis columellae pedum in altitudinem V defiguntur Has inter se capreolis molli fastigio coniungunt , ubi tigna , quae musculi tegendi causa ponant , collocentur . <end>$$<start> This was the form of it : first , two beams of equal length were laid on the ground , at the distance of four feet from each other ; and in them were fastened small pillars , five feet high , which were joined together by braces , with a gentle slope , on which the timber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be laid : upon this were laid beams , two feet square , bound with iron plates and nails . <end>
<start> Ad extremum musculi tectum trabesque extremas quadratas regulas IIII patentes digitos defigunt , quae lateres , qui super musculo struantur , contineant . <end>$$<start> The roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in the same manner as the joists were laid on the braces , the musculus was covered with tiles and mortar , to secure it against fire , which might be thrown from the wall . <end>
<start> Ita fastigato atque ordinatim structo , ut trabes erant in capreolis collocatae , lateribus lutoque musculus , ut ab igni , qui ex muro iaceretur , tutus esset , contegitur . <end>$$<start> Over the tiles hides are spread , to prevent the water let in on them by spouts from dissolving the cement of the bricks . <end>
<start> Super lateres coria inducuntur , ne canalibus aqua immissa lateres diluere posset Coria autem , ne rursus igni ac lapidibus corrumpantur , centonibus conteguntur . <end>$$<start> Again , the hides were covered over with mattresses , that they might not be destroyed by fire or stones . <end>
<start> Hoc opus omne tectum vineis ad ipsam turrim perficiunt subitoque inopinantibus hostibus machinatione navali , phalangis subiectis , ad turrim hostium admovent , ut aedificio iungatur . <end>$$<start> The soldiers under the protection of the vineae , finish this whole work to the very tower ; and suddenly , before the enemy were aware of it , moved it forward by naval machinery , by putting rollers under it , close up to the enemy's turret , so that it even touched the building . <end>
<start> Quo malo perterriti subito oppidani saxa quam maxima possunt vectibus promovent praecipitataque muro in musculum devolvunt . <end>$$<start> The townsmen , affrighted at this unexpected stroke , bring forward with levers the largest stones they can procure , and pitching them from the wall , roll them down on the musculus . <end>
<start> Ictum firmitas materiae sustinet , et quicquid incidit fastigio musculi elabitur . <end>$$<start> The strength of the timber withstood the shock ; and whatever fell on it slid off , on account of the sloping roof . <end>
<start> Id ubi vident , mutant consilium : cupas taeda ac pice refertas incendunt easque de muro in musculum devolvunt . <end>$$<start> When they perceived this , they altered their plan , and set fire to barrels , filled with resin and tar , and rolled them down from the wall on the musculus . <end>
<start> Involutae labuntur , delapsae ab lateribus longuriis furcisque ab opere removentur . <end>$$<start> As soon as they fell on it , they slid off again , and were removed from its side by long poles and forks . <end>
<start> Interim sub musculo milites vectibus infima saxa turris hostium , quibus fundamenta continebantur , convellunt . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , the soldiers , under cover of the musculus , were rooting out with crow-bars the lowest stones of the enemy's turret , with which the foundation was laid . <end>
<start> Musculus ex turri latericia a nostris telis tormentisque defenditur ; hostes ex muro ac turibus submoventur : non datur libera muri defendendi facultas . <end>$$<start> The musculus was defended by darts , thrown from engines by our men from the brick tower , and the enemy were beaten off from the wall and turrets ; nor was a fair opportunity of defending the walls given them . <end>
<start> Compluribus iam lapidibus ex ea , quae suberat , turri subductis repentina ruina pars eius turris concidit , pars reliqua consequens procumbebat : cum hostes urbis direptione perterriti inermes cum infulis se porta foras universi proripiunt ad legatos atque exercitum supplices manus tendunt . <end>$$<start> At length several stones being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the musculus , part of it fell down suddenly , and the rest , as if following it , leaned forward . <end>
<start> Ubi hostes ad legatos exercitumque pervenerunt , universi se ad pedes proiciunt ; orant , ut adventus Caesaris exspectetur : captam suam urbem videre : opera perfecta , turrim subrutam ; itaque ab defensione desistere . <end>$$<start> At this uncommon occurrence , the whole progress of the war was stopped , and the soldiers , turning away from the battle , ran eagerly to hear and listen to them . <end>
<start> Docent , si omnino turris concidisset , non posse milites contineri , quin spe praedae in urbem irrumperent urbemque delerent . <end>$$<start> They inform them that , if the turret had entirely fallen down , the soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it , in hopes of getting spoil . <end>
<start> Haec atque eiusdem generis complura ut ab hominibus doctis magna cum misericordia fletuque pronuntiantur . <end>$$<start> These and several other arguments to the same effect were delivered , as they were a people of great learning , with great pathos and lamentations . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus commoti legati milites ex opere deducunt , oppuguatione desistunt ; operibus custodias relinquunt . <end>$$<start> The lieutenants moved with compassion , draw off the soldiers from the work , desist from the assault , and leave sentinels on the works . <end>
<start> Caesar enim per litteras Trebonio magnopere mandaverat , ne per vim oppidum expugnari pateretur , ne gravius permoti milites et defectionis odio et contemptione sui et diutino labore omnes puberes interficerent ; quod se facturos minabantur , aegreque tunc sunt retenti , quin oppidum irrumperent , graviterque cam rem tulerunt , quod stetisse per Treboninm , quo minus oppido potirentur , videbatur . <end>$$<start> And it was with difficulty that they were then restrained from breaking into the town , and they were much displeased , because they imagined that they were prevented by Trebonius from taking possession of it . <end>
<start> Nostri repentina fortuna permoti arma , quae possunt , arripiunt ; alii ex castris sese incitant . <end>$$<start> Our men , alarmed at such an unexpected turn of fortune , lay hold on such arms as they could find . <end>
<start> Fit in hostes impetus ; sed de muro sagittis tormentisque fugientes persequi prohibentur . <end>$$<start> Some rush from the camp ; an attack is made on the enemy : but they were prevented , by arrows and engines from the walls ; from pursuing them when they fled . <end>
<start> Illi sub murum se recipiunt ibique musculum turrimque latericiam libere incendunt . <end>$$<start> They retired to their walls , and there , without fear , set the musculus and brick tower on fire . <end>
<start> Ita multorum mensium labor hostium perfidia et vi tempestatis puncto temporis interiit . <end>$$<start> Thus , by the perfidy of the enemy and the violence of the storm , the labor of many months was destroyed in a moment . <end>
<start> Temptaverunt hoc idem Massilienses postero die . <end>$$<start> The Massilians made the same attempt the next day , having got such another storm . <end>
<start> Eandem nacti tempestatem maiore cum fiducia ad alteram turrim aggeremque eruptione pugnaverunt multumque ignem intulerunt . <end>$$<start> They sallied out against the other tower and agger , and fought with more confidence . <end>
<start> Sed ut superioris temporis contentionem nostri omnem remiserant , ita proximi diei casu admoniti omnia ad defensionem paraverant . <end>$$<start> But as our men had on the former occasion given up all thoughts of a contest , so , warned by the event of the preceding day , they had made every preparation for a defense . <end>
<start> Itaque multis interfectis reliquos infecta re in oppidum reppulerunt . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , they slew several , and forced the rest to retreat into the town without effecting their design . <end>
<start> Trebonius ea , quae sunt amissa , multo majore militum studio administrare et reficere instituit Nam ubi tantos suos labores et apparatus male cecidisse viderunt indutiisque per scelus violatis suam virtutem irrisui fore perdoluerunt , quod , unde agger omnino comportari posset , nihil erat reliquum , omnibus arboribus longe lateque in finibus Massiliensium excisis et convectis , aggerem novi generis atque inauditum ex latericiis duobus muris senum pedum crassitudine atque eorum murorum contignatione facere instituerunt aequa fere altitudine , atque ille congesticius ex materia fuerat agger . <end>$$<start> Trebonius began to provide and repair what had been destroyed , with much greater zeal on the part of the soldiers ; for when they saw that their extraordinary pains and preparations had an unfortunate issue , they were fired with indignation that , in consequence of the impious violation of the truce , their valor should be held in derision . <end>
<start> Ubi aut spatium inter muros aut imbecillitas materiae postulare videretur , pilae interponuntur , traversaria tigna iniciuntur , quae firmamento esse possint , et quicquid est contignatum cratibus consternitur , crates luto integuntur . <end>$$<start> There was no place left them from which the materials for their mound could be fetched , in consequence of all the timber , far and wide , in the territories of the Massilians , having been cut down and carried away ; they began therefore to make an agger of a new construction , never heard of before , of two walls of brick , each six feet thick , and to lay floors over them of almost the same breadth with the agger , made of timber . <end>
<start> Portae , quibus locis videtur , eruptionis causa in muro relinquuntur . <end>$$<start> Gates for making sallies were left in the wall in such places as they thought proper . <end>
<start> Quod ubi hostes viderunt , ea , quae vix longinquo spatio refici non posse sperassent , paucorum dierum opera et labore ita refecta , ut nullus perfidiae neque eruptioni locus esset nec quicquam omnino relinqueretur , qua aut telis militibus aut igni operibus noceri posset , eodemque exemplo sentiunt totam urbem , qua sit aditus ab terra , muro turribusque circumiri posse , sic ut ipsis consistendi in suis munitionibus locus non esset , cum paene inaedificata muris ab exercitu nostro moenia viderentur ac telum manu coniceretur , suorumque tormentorum usum , quibus ipsi magna speravissent , spatio propinquitatis interire parique condicione ex muro ac turribus bellandi data se virtute nostris adaequare non posse intellegunt , ad easdem deditionis condiciones recurrunt . <end>$$<start> But when the enemy perceived that those works , which they had hoped could not be replaced without a great length of time , were put into so thorough repair by a few day's labor and diligence , that there was no room for perfidy or sallies , and that no means were left them by which they could either hurt the men by resistance or the works by fire , and when they found by former examples that their town could be surrounded with a wall and turrets on every part by which it was accessible by land , in such a manner that they could not have room to stand on their own fortifications , because our works were built almost on the top of their walls by our army , and darts could be thrown from our hands , and when they perceived that all advantage arising from their engines , on which they had built great hopes , was totally lost , and that though they had an opportunity of fighting with us on equal terms from walls and turrets , they could perceive that they were not equal to our men in bravery , they had recourse to the same proposals of surrender as before . <end>
<start> Varro in ulteriore Hispania initio cognitis eis rebus , quae sunt in Italia gestae , diffidens Pompeianis rebus amicissime de Caesare loquebatur : pracoccupatum sese legatione ab Gnaeus Pompeio teneri obstrictum fide ; necessitudinem quidem sibi nihilo minorem cum Caesare intercedere , neque se ignorare , quod esset officium legati , qui fiduciariam operam obtineret , quae vires suae , quae voluntas erga Caesarem totius provinciae . <end>$$<start> That though , being pre-engaged to Cneius Pompey in quality of lieutenant , he was bound in honor to him , that , nevertheless , there existed a very intimate tie between him and Caesar ; that he was not ignorant of what was the duty of a lieutenant , who bore an office of trust ; nor of his own strength , nor of the disposition of the whole province to Caesar . <end>
<start> Haec omnibus ferebat sermonibus neque se in ullam partem movebat . <end>$$<start> These sentiments he constantly expressed in his ordinary conversation , and did not attach himself to either party . <end>
<start> Postea vero , cum Caesarem ad Massiliam detineri cognovit , copias Petreii cum exercitu Afranii esse coniunctas , magna auxilia convenisse , magna esse in spe atque exspectari et consentire omnem citeriorem provinciam , quaeque postea acciderant , de angustiis ad Ilerdam rei fumentariae , accepit , atque haec ad eum latius atque inflatius Afranius perscribebat , se quoque ad motus fortunae movere coepit . <end>$$<start> But afterward , when he found that Caesar was detained before Massilia , that the forces of Petreius had effected a junction with the army of Afranius , that considerable reinforcements had come to their assistance , that there were great hopes and expectations , and heard that the whole Hither province had entered into a confederacy , and of the difficulties to which Caesar was reduced afterward at Ilerda for want of provisions , and Afranius wrote to him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these matters , he began to regulate his movements by those of fortune . <end>
<start> Frumenti magnum numerum coegit , quod Massiliensibus , item quod Afranio Petreioque mitteret . <end>$$<start> He himself Varro made severe harangues against Caesar . <end>
<start> Naves longas X Gaditanis ut facerent imperavit , complures praeterea Hispali faciendas curavit . <end>$$<start> He often pronounced from his tribunal that Caesar had fought several unsuccessful battles , and that a great number of his men had deserted to Afranius . <end>
<start> Cognitis eis rebus , quae sunt gestae in citeriore Hispania , bellum parabat . <end>$$<start> He was to retire with his two legions to Gades , and to lay up all the shipping and provisions there . <end>
<start> Ratio autem haec erat belli , ut se cum II legionibus Gades conferret , naves frumentumque omne ibi contineret ; provinciam enim omnem Caesaris rebus favere cognoverat . <end>$$<start> For he had been informed that the whole province was inclined to favor Caesar's party . <end>
<start> In insula frumento navibusque comparatis bellum duci non difficile existimabat . <end>$$<start> He thought that the war might be easily protracted in an island , if he was provided with corn and shipping . <end>
<start> Caesar , etsi multis necessariisque rebus in Italiam revocabatur , tamen constituerat nullam partem belli in Hispaniis relinquere , quod magna esse Pompei beneficia et magnas clientelas in citeriore provincia sciebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , although called back to Italy by many and important matters , yet had determined to leave no dregs of war behind him in Spain , because he knew that Pompey had many dependents and clients in the hither province . <end>
<start> Itaque duabus legionibus missis in ulteriorem Hispaniam cum Quintus Cassio , tribuno plebis , ipse DC cum equitibus magnis itineribus progreditur edictumque praemittit , ad quam diem magistratus principesque omnium civitatum sibi esse praesto Cordubae vellet . <end>$$<start> Having therefore sent two legions into Further Spain under the command of Quintus Cassius , tribune of the people ; he himself advances with six hundred horse by forced marches , and issues a proclamation , appointing a day on which the magistrates and nobility of all the states should attend him at Corduba . <end>
<start> Quo edicto tota provincia pervulgato nulla fuit civitas , quin ad id tempus partem senatus Cordubam mitteret , non civis Romanus paulo notior , quin ad diem conveniret . <end>$$<start> This proclamation being published through the whole province , there was not a state that did not send a part of their senate to Corduba , at the appointed time ; and not a Roman citizen of any note but appeared that day . <end>
<start> Simul ipse Cordubae conventus per se portas Varroni clausit , custodias vigiliasque in turribus muroque disposuit , cohortes duas , quae colonicae appellabantur , cum eo casu venissent , tuendi oppidi causa apud se retinuit . <end>$$<start> At the same time the senate at Corduba shut the gates of their own accord against Varro , and posted guards and sentinels on the wall and in the turrets , and detained two cohorts (called Colonicae , which had come there accidentally) , for the defense of the town . <end>
<start> Eisdem diebus Carmo nenses , quae est longe firmissima totius provinciae civitas , deductis tribus in arcem oppidi cobortibus a Varrone praesidio , per se cohortes eiecit portasque praeclusit . <end>$$<start> About the same time the people of Carmona , which is by far the strongest state in the whole province , of themselves drove out of the town the cohorts , and shut the gates against them , although three cohorts had been detached by Varro to garrison the citadel . <end>
<start> Hoc vero magis properare Varro , ut cum legionibus quam primum Gades contenderet , ne itinere aut traiectu intercluderetur : tanta ac tam secunda in Caesarem voluntas provinciae reperiebatur . <end>$$<start> But Varro was in greater haste on this account to reach Gades with his legion as soon as possible , lest he should be stopped either on his march or on crossing over to the island . <end>
<start> Progresso ei paulo longius litterae Gadibus redduntur : simulatque sit cognitum de edicto Caesaris , consensisse Gaditanos principes eum tribunis cohortium , quae essent ibi in praesidio , ut Gallonium ex oppido expellerent , urbem insulamque Caesari servarent . <end>$$<start> The affection of the province to Caesar proved so great and so favorable , that he received a letter from Gades , before he was far advanced on his march : that as soon as the nobility of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation , they had combined with the tribune of the cohorts , which were in garrison there , to drive Gallonius out of the town , and to secure the city and island for Caesar . <end>
<start> Hoc inito consilio denuntiavisse Gallonio , ut sua sponte , dum sine periculo liceret , excederet Gadibus ; si id non fecisset , sibi consilium capturos . <end>$$<start> That having agreed on the design they had sent notice to Gallonius , to quit Gades of his own accord while he could do it with safety ; if he did not , they would take measures for themselves ; that for fear of this Gallonius had been induced to quit the town . <end>
<start> Hoc timore adductum Gallonium Gadibus excessisse His cognitis rebus altera ex duabus legionibus , quae vernacula appellabatur , ex castris Varronis adstante et inspectante ipso signa sustulit seseque Hispalim recepit atque in foro et porticibus sine maleficio consedit . <end>$$<start> When this was known , one of Varro's two legions , which was called Vernacula , carried off the colors from Varro's camp , he himself standing by and looking on , and retired to Hispalis , and took post in the market and public places without doing any injury , and the Roman citizens residing there approved so highly of this act , that every one most earnestly offered to entertain them in their houses . <end>
<start> Quod factum adeo eius conventus cives Romani comprobaverunt , ut domum ad se quisque hospitio cupidissime reciperet . <end>$$<start> When Varro , terrified at these things , having altered his route , proposed going to Italica , he was informed by his friends that the gates were shut against him . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus perterritus Varro , cum itinere converso sese Italicam venturum praemisisset , certior ab suis factus est praeclusas esse portas . <end>$$<start> Then indeed , when intercepted from every road , he sends word to Caesar , that he was ready to deliver up the legion which he commanded . <end>
<start> Tum vero omni interclusus itinere ad Caesarem mittit , paratum se esse legionem , cui iusserit , tradere . <end>$$<start> He sends to him Sextus Caesar , and orders him to deliver it up to him . <end>
<start> Ille ad eum Sextum Caesarem mittit atque huic tradi iubet Tradita legione Varro Cordubam ad Caesarem venit ; relatis ad eum publicis cum fide rationibus quod penes eum est pecuniae tradit et , quid ubique habeat frumenti et navium , ostendit . <end>$$<start> Varro , having delivered up the legion , went to Caesar to Corduba , and having laid before him the public accounts , handed over to him most faithfully whatever money he had , and told him what quantity of corn and shipping he had , and where . <end>
<start> Caesar contione habita Cordubae omnibus generatim gratias agit : civibus Romanis , quod oppidum in sua potestate studuissent habere ; Hispanis , quod praesidia expulissent ; Gaditanis , quod conatus adversariorum infregissent seseque in libertatem vindicassent ; tribunis militum centurionibusque , qui eo praesidii causa venerant , quod eorum consilia sua virtute confirmassent . <end>$$<start> Caesar made a public oration at Corduba , in which he returned thanks to all severally : to the Roman citizens , because they had been zealous to keep the town in their own power ; to the Spaniards , for having driven out the garrison ; to the Gaditani , for having defeated the attempts of his enemies , and asserted their own liberty ; to the Tribunes and Centurions who had gone there as a guard , for having by their valor confirmed them in their purpose . <end>
<start> Pecunias , quas erant in publicum Varroni cives Romani polliciti , remittit ; bona restituit eis , quos liberius locutos hanc poenam tulisse cognoverat Tributis quibusdam populis publicis privatisque praemiis reliquos in posterum bona spe complet biduumque Cordubae commoratus Gades proficiscitur ; pecunias monumentaque , quae ex fano Herculis collata erant in privatam domum , referri in templum iubet . <end>$$<start> He remitted the tax which the Roman citizens had promised to Varro for the public use : he restored their goods to those who he was informed had incurred that penalty by speaking too freely , having given public and private rewards to some he filled the rest with flattering hopes of his future intentions ; and having staid two days at Corduba , he set out for Gades ; he ordered the money and ornaments which had been carried away from the temple of Hercules , and lodged in the houses of private persons , to be replaced in the temple . <end>
<start> Provinciae Quintus Cassium praeficit ; huic III legiones attribuit . <end>$$<start> He made Quintus Cassius governor of the province , and assigned him four legions . <end>
<start> Eadem ratione privatim ac publice quibusdam civitatibus habitis honoribus Tarracone discedit pedibusque Narbonem atque inde Massiliam perverit , Ibi legem de dictatore latam seseque dictatorem dictum a Marcus Lepido praetore cognoscit . <end>$$<start> There he was informed that a law was passed for creating a dictator , and that he had been nominated dictator by Marcus Lepidus the praetor . <end>
<start> Massilienses omnibus defessi malis , rei frumentariae ad summam inopiam adducti , bis navali proelio superati , crebris eruptionibus fusi , gravi etiam pestilentia conflictati ex diutina conclusione et mutatione victus (panico enim vetere atque hordeo corrupto omnes alebantur , quod ad huiusmodi casus antiquitus paratum in publicum contulerant) deiecta turri , labefacta magna parte muri , auxiliis provinciarum et exercituum desperatis , quos in Caesaris potestatem venisse cognoverant , sese dedere sine fraude constituunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians , wearied out by misfortunes of every sort , reduced to the lowest ebb for want of corn , conquered in two engagements at sea , defeated in their frequent sallies , and struggling moreover with a fatal pestilence , from their long confinement and change of victuals (for they all subsisted on old millet and damaged barley , which they had formerly provided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency of this kind) , their turret being demolished , a great part of their wall having given way , and despairing of any aid , either from the provinces or their armies , for these they had heard had fallen into Caesar's power , resolved to surrender now without dissimulation . <end>
<start> Sed paucis ante diebus Lucius Domitius cognita Massiliensium voluntate navibus III comparatis , ex quibus duas familiaribus suis attribuerat , unam ipse conscenderat nactus turbidam tempestatem profectus est . <end>$$<start> But a few days before , Lucius Domitius , having discovered the intention of the Massilians , and having procured three ships , two of which he gave up to his friends , went on board the third himself , having got a brisk wind , put out to sea . <end>
<start> Hunc conspicatae naves , quae iussu Bruti consuetudine cotidiana ad portum excubabant , sublatis ancoris sequi coeperunt . <end>$$<start> Some ships , which by Brutus's orders were constantly cruising near the port , having espied him , weighed anchor , and pursued him . <end>
<start> Ex his unum ipsius navigium contendit et fugere perseveravit auxilioque tempestatis ex conspectu abiit , duo perterrita concursu nostrarum navium sese in portum receperunt . <end>$$<start> But of these , the ship on board of which he was , persevered itself , and continuing its flight , and by the aid of the wind got out of sight : the other two , affrighted by the approach of our galleys put back again into the harbor . <end>
<start> Massilienses arma tormentaque ex oppido , ut est imperatum , proferunt , naves ex portu navalibusque educunt , pecuniam ex publico tradunt . <end>$$<start> The Massilians conveyed their arms and engines out of the town , as they were ordered : brought their ships out of the port and docks , and delivered up the money in their treasury . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus confectis Caesar magis eos pro nomine et vetustate , quam pro meritis in se civitatis conservans duas ibi legiones praesidio relinquit , ceteras in Italiam mittit ; ipse ad urbem proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> When these affairs were dispatched , Caesar , sparing the town more out of regard to their renown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to his favor , left two legions in garrison there , sent the rest to Italy , and set out himself for Rome . <end>
<start> Eisdem temporibus Gaius Curio in Africam profectus ex Sicilia et iam ab initio copias Publius Attii Vari despiciens duas legiones ex IIII , quas a Caesare acceperat , D equites transportabat biduoque et noctibus tribus navigatione consumptis appellit ad eum locum , qui appellatur Anquillaria . <end>$$<start> About the same time Caius Curio , having sailed from Sicily to Africa , and from the first despising the forces of Publius Attius Varus , transported only two of the four legions which he had received from Caesar , and five hundred horse , and having spent two days and three nights on the voyage , arrived at a place called Aquilaria , which is about twenty-two miles distant from Clupea , and in the summer season has a convenient harbor , and is inclosed by two projecting promontories . <end>
<start> Hic locus abest a Clupeis passuum XXII milia habetque non incommodam aestate stationem et duobus eminentibus promuntoriis continetur Huius adventum Lucius Caesar filius cum X longis navibus ad Clupea praestolans , quas naves Uticae ex praedonum bello subductas Publius Attius reficiendas huius belli causa curaverat , veritus navium multitudinem ex alto refugerat appulsaque ad proximum litus trireme constrata et in litore relicta pedibus Adrumetum perfugerat . <end>$$<start> Lucius Caesar the son , who was waiting his arrival near Clupea with ten ships which had been taken near Utica in a war with the pirates , and which Publius Attius had had repaired for this war , frightened at the number of our ships , fled the sea , and running his three-decked covered galley on the nearest shore , left her there and made his escape by land to Adrumetum . <end>
<start> Id oppidum Gaius Considius Longus unius legionis praesidio tuebatur . <end>$$<start> Caius Considius Longus , with a garrison of one legion , guarded this town . <end>
<start> Reliquae Caesaris naves eius fuga se Adrumetum receperunt . <end>$$<start> The rest of Caesar's fleet , after his flight , retired to Adrumetum . <end>
<start> Hunc secutus Marcius Rufas quaestor navibus XII , quas praesidio onerariis navibus Curio ex Sicilia eduxerat , postquam in litore relictam navem conspexit , hanc remulco abstraxit ; ipse ad Gaius Curionem cum classe redit . <end>$$<start> Marcus Rufus , the quaestor , pursued him with twelve ships , which Curio had brought from Sicily as convoy to the merchantmen , and seeing a ship left on the shore , he brought her off by a towing rope , and returned with his fleet to Curio . <end>
<start> Curio Marcium Uticam navibus praemittit ; ipse eodem cum exercitu proficiscitur biduique iter progressus ad flumen Bagradam pervenit . <end>$$<start> Curio detached Marcus before with the fleet to Utica , and marched thither with his army . <end>
<start> Ibi Gaius Caninium Rebilum legatum cum legionibus reliquit ; ipse cum equitatu antecedit ad castra exploranda Cornelia , quod is locus peridoneus castris habebatur . <end>$$<start> Having advanced two days , he came to the river Bagrada , and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus , the lieutenant , with the legions ; and went forward himself with the horse to view the Cornelian camp , because that was reckoned a very eligible position for encamping . <end>
<start> Id autem est iugum directum eminens in mare , utraque ex parte praeruptum atque asperum , sed tamen paulo leniore fastigio ab ea parte , quae ad Uticam vergit . <end>$$<start> It is a straight ridge , projecting into the sea , steep and rough on both sides , but the ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite Utica . <end>
<start> Abest directo itinere ab Utica paulo amplius passuum milibus III . <end>$$<start> It is not more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line . <end>
<start> Sed hoc itinere est fons , quo mare succedit longius , lateque is locus restagnat ; quem si qui vitare voluerit , sex milium circuitu in oppidum pervenit . <end>$$<start> But on this road there is a spring , to which the sea comes up , and overflows ; an extensive morass is thereby formed ; and if a person would avoid it , he must make a circuit of six miles to reach the town . <end>
<start> Hoc explorato loco Curio castra Vari conspicit muro oppidoque coniuncta ad portam , quae appellatur Belica , admodum munita natura loci , una ex parte ipso oppido Utica , altero a theatro , quod est ante oppidum , substructionibus eius operis maximis , aditu ad castra difficili et angusto . <end>$$<start> Having examined this place , Curio got a view of Varus's camp , joining the wall and town , at the gate called Bellica , well fortified by its natural situation , on one side by the town itself , on the other by a theater which is before the town , the approaches to the town being rendered difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of that structure . <end>
<start> Simul animadvertit multa undique portari atque agi plenissimis viis , quae repentini tumultus timore ex agris in urbem conferantur . <end>$$<start> At the same time he observed the roads very full of carriages and cattle , which they were conveying from the country into the town on the sudden alarm . <end>
<start> Huc equitatum mittit , ut diriperet atque haberet loco praedae ; eodemque tempore his rebus subsidio DC Numidae ex oppido peditesque CCCC mittuntur a Varo , quos auxilii causa rex Iuba paucis diebus ante Uticam miserat . <end>$$<start> He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the spoil And at the same time Varus had detached as a guard for them six hundred Numidian horse , and four hundred foot , which king Juba had sent to Utica as auxiliaries a few days before . <end>
<start> Huic et paternum hospitium cum Pompeio et simultas cum Curione intercedebat , quod tribunus plebis legem promulgaverat , qua lege regnum Iubae publicaverat . <end>$$<start> There was a friendship subsisting between his Juba's father and Pompey , and a feud between him and Curio , because he , when a tribune of the people , had proposed a law , in which he endeavored to make public property of the kingdom of Juba . <end>
<start> Concurrunt equites inter se ; neque vero primum impetum nostrorum Numidae ferre potuerunt , sed interfectis circiter CXX reliqui se in castra ad oppidum receperunt . <end>$$<start> The horse engaged ; but the Numidians were not able to stand our first charge ; but a hundred and twenty being killed , the rest retreated into their camp near the town . <end>
<start> Interim adventu longarum navium Curio pronuntiare onerariis navibus iubet , quae stabant ad Uticam numero circiter CC , se in hostium habiturum loco , qui non e vestigio ad castra Cornelia naves traduxisset . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , on the arrival of his men of war , Curio ordered proclamation to be made to the merchant ships , which lay at anchor before Utica , in number about two hundred , that he would treat as enemies all that did not set sail immediately for the Cornelian camp . <end>
<start> Qua pronuntiatione facta temporis puncto sublatis ancoris omnes Uticam relinquunt et quo imperatum est transeunt . <end>$$<start> As soon as the proclamation was made , in an instant they all weighed anchor and left Utica , and repaired to the place commanded them . <end>
<start> Quae res omnium rerum copia complevit exercitum . <end>$$<start> This circumstance furnished the army with plenty of every thing . <end>
<start> His rebus gestis Curio se in castra ad Bagradam recipit atque universi exercitus conclamatione imperator appellatur posteroque die exercitum Uticam ducit et prope oppidum castra ponit . <end>$$<start> After these transactions , Curio returned to his camp to Bragada ; and by a general shout of the whole army was saluted imperator . <end>
<start> Nondum opere castrorum perfecto equites ex statione nuntiant magna auxilia equitum peditumque ab rege missa Uticam venire ; eodemque tempore vis magna pulveris cernebatur , et vestigio temporis primum agmen erat in conspectu . <end>$$<start> The next day he led his army to Utica , and encamped near the town Before the works of the camp were finished , the horse upon guard brought him word that a large supply of horse and foot sent by king Juba were on their march to Utica , and at the same time a cloud of dust was observed , and in a moment the front of the line was in sight . <end>
<start> Novitate rei Curio permotus praemittit equites , qui primum impetum sustineant ac morentur ; ipse celeriter ab opere deductis legionibus aciem instruit . <end>$$<start> Curio , surprised at the suddenness of the affair , sent on the horse to receive their first charge , and detain them . <end>
<start> Equitesque committunt proelium et , priusquam plane legiones explicari et consistere possent , tota auxilia regis impedita ac perturbata , quod nullo ordine et sine timore iter fecerant , in fugam coniciunt equitatuque omni fere incolumi , quod se per litora celeriter in oppidum recepit , magnum peditum numerum interficiunt . <end>$$<start> He immediately called off his legions from the work , and put them in battle array The horse began the battle : and before the legions could be completely marshaled and take their ground , the king's entire forces being thrown into disorder and confusion , because they had marched without any order , and were under no apprehensions , betake themselves to flight : almost all the enemy's horse being safe , because they made a speedy retreat into the town along the shore , Caesar's soldiers slay a great number of their infantry . <end>
<start> Proxima nocte centuriones Marsi duo ex castris Curionis cum manipularibus suis XXII ad Attium Varum perfugiunt . <end>$$<start> The next night two Marsian centurions with twenty-two men belonging to the companies , deserted from Curio's camp to Attius Varus . <end>
<start> Hi , sive vere quam habuerant opinionem ad eum perferunt , sive etiam auribus Vari serviunt (nam , quae volumus , et credimus libenter et , quae sentimus ipsi , reliquos sentire speramus) , confirmant quidem certe totius exercitus animos alienos esse a Curione maximeque opus esse in conspectum exercitus venire et colloquendi dare facultatem . <end>$$<start> They , whether they uttered the sentiments which they really entertained , or wished to gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give credit to , and what we think ourselves , we hope is the opinion of other men) , assured him , that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to Curio , that it was very expedient that the armies should be brought in view of each other , and an opportunity of a conference be given . <end>
<start> Qua opinione adductus Varus postero die mane legiones ex castris educit Facit idem Curio , atque una valle non magna interiecta suas uterque copias instruit . <end>$$<start> Induced by their opinion , Varus the next day led his troops out of the camp : Curio did so in like manner , and with only one small valley between them , each drew up his forces . <end>
<start> Erat in exercitu Vari Sextus Quintilius Varus , quem fuisse Corfinii supra demonstratum est . <end>$$<start> In Varus's army there was one Sextus Quintilius Varus who , as we have mentioned before , was at Corfinium . <end>
<start> Hic dimissus a Caesare in Africam venerat , legionesque eas traduxerat Curio , quas superioribus temporibus Corfinlo receperat Caesar , adeo ut paucis mutatis centurionibus eidem ordines manipulique constarent . <end>$$<start> When Caesar gave him his liberty , he went over to Africa ; now , Curio had transported to Africa those legions which Caesar had received under his command a short time before at Corfinium ; so that the officers and companies were still the same , excepting the change of a few centurions . <end>
<start> Hanc nactus appellationis causam Quintilius circuire aciem Curionis atque obsecrare milites coepit , ne primam sacramenti , quod apud Domitium atque apud se quaestorem dixissent , memoriam deponerent , neu contra eos arma ferrent , qui eadem essent usi fortuna eademque in obsidione perpessi , neu pro his pugnarent , a quibus cum contumelia perfugae appellarentur . <end>$$<start> Quintilius , making this a pretext for addressing them , began to go round Curio's lines , and to entreat the soldiers not to lose all recollection of the oath which they took first to Domitius and to him their quaestor , nor bear arms against those who had shared the same fortune , and endured the same hardships in a siege , nor fight for those by whom they had been opprobriously called deserters . <end>
<start> Huc pauca ad spem largitionis addidit , quae ab sua liberalitate , si se atque Attium secuti essent , exspectare deberent . <end>$$<start> To this he added a few words by way of encouragement , what they might expect from his own liberality , if they should follow him and Attius . <end>
<start> Hac habita oratione nullam in partem ab exercitu Curionis fit significatio , atque ita suas uterque copias reducit . <end>$$<start> On the delivery of this speech , no intimation of their future conduct is given by Curio's army , and thus both generals led back their troops to their camp . <end>
<start> Unusquisque enim opiniones fingebat et ad id , quod ab alio audierat , sui aliquid timoris addebat . <end>$$<start> These were the legions which a short time before had belonged to the enemy ; for the custom of offering free towns to those who joined the opposite party had changed Caesar's kindness . <end>
<start> Hoc ubi uno auctore ad plures permanaverat , atque alius alii tradiderat , plures auctores eius rei videbantur . <end>$$<start> For the harshest expressions of the soldiers in general did not proceed from the Marsi and Peligni , as those which passed in the tents the night before ; and some of their fellow soldiers heard them with displeasure . <end>
<start> Quibus de causis consilio convocato de summa rerum deliberare incipit . <end>$$<start> For these reasons , having called a council , Curio began to deliberate on the general welfare . <end>
<start> Erant sententiae , quae conandum omnibus modis castraque Vari oppugnanda censerent , quod in huiusmodi militum consiliis otium maxime contrarium esse arbitrarentur ; postremo praestare dicebant per virtutem in pugna belli fortunam experiri , quam desertos et circumventos ab suis gravissimum supplicium perpeti . <end>$$<start> In short , they said that it was better bravely to try the hazard of war in a battle , than to be deserted and surrounded by their own troops , and forced to submit to the greatest cruelties . <end>
<start> Curio utrumque improbans consilium , quantum alteri sententiae deesset animi , tantum alteri superesse dicebat : hos turpissimae fugae rationem habere , illos etiam iniquo loco dimicandum putare . <end>$$<start> Curio , censuring both measures , said , that the one was as deficient in spirit , as the other exceeded in it : that the latter advised a shameful flight , and the former recommended us to engage at a great disadvantage . <end>
<start> Qua enim , inquit , fiducia et opere et natura loci munitissima castra expugnari posse confidimus ? Aut vero quid proficimus , si accepto magno detrimento ab oppugnatione castrorum discedimus ? Quasi non et felicitas rerum gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et res adversae odia colligant! Castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et desperationem omnium et alienationem exercitus ? Nam neque pudentes suspicari oportet sibi parum credi , neque improbos scire sese timeri , quod his licentiam timor augeat noster , illis studia deminuat . <end>$$<start> For on what , says he , can we rely that we can storm a camp , fortified both by nature and art ? Or , indeed , what advantage do we gain if we give over the assault , after having suffered considerable loss ; as if success did not acquire for a general the affection of his army , and misfortune their hatred ? But what does a change of camp imply but a shameful flight and universal despair , and the alienation of the army ? For neither ought the obedient to suspect that they are distrusted , nor the insolent to know that we fear them ; because our fears augment the licentiousness of the latter , and diminish the zeal of the former . <end>
<start> Quod si iam , inquit , haec explorata habeamus , quae de exercitus alienatione dicuntur , quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione esse confido , quanto haec dissimulari et occultari , quam per nos confirmari praestet ? An non , uti corporis vulnera , ita exercitus incommoda sunt tegenda , ne spem adversariis augeamus ? At etiam , ut media nocte proficiscamur , addunt , quo maiorem , credo , licentiam habeant , qui peccare conentur . <end>$$<start> But if , says he , we were convinced of the truth of the reports of the disaffection of the army (which I indeed am confident are either altogether groundless , or at least less than they are supposed to be) , how much better to conceal and hide our suspicions of it , than by our conduct confirm it ? Ought not the defects of an army to be as carefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies , lest we should increase the enemy's hopes ? but they moreover advise us to set out at midnight , in order , I suppose , that those who attempt to do wrong may have a fairer opportunity ; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by shame or fear , to the display of which the night is most averse . <end>
<start> Namque huiusmodi res aut pudore aut metu tenentur ; quibus rebus nox maxime adversaria est Quare neque tanti sum animi , ut sine spe castra oppugnanda censeam , neque tanti timoris , uti spe deficiam , atque omnia prius experienda arbitror magnaque ex parte iam me una vobiscum de re iudicium facturum confido . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , I am neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack their camp without hopes of succeeding ; nor so influenced by fear as to despond : and I imagine that every expedient ought first to be tried ; and I am in a great degree confident that I shall form the same opinions as yourselves on this matter . <end>
<start> Commemorat , quo sit eorum usus studio ad Corfinium Caesar , ut magnam partem Italiae beneficio atque auctoritate eorum suam fecerit . <end>$$<start> For , says he , all the municipal towns afterward imitated you and your conduct ; nor was it without reason that Caesar judged so favorably , and the enemy so harshly of you . <end>
<start> Vos enim vestrumque factum omnia , inquit , deinceps municipia sunt secuta , neque sine causa et Caesar amicissime de vobis et illi gravissime iudicaverunt . <end>$$<start> For Pompey , though beaten in no engagement , yet was obliged to shift his ground , and leave Italy , from the precedent established by your conduct . <end>
<start> Pompeius enim nullo proelio pulsus vestri facti praeiudicio demotus Italia excessit ; Caesar me , quem sibi carissimum habuit , provinciam Siciliam atque Africam , sine quibus urbem atque Italiam tueri non potest , vestrae fidei commisit . <end>$$<start> Caesar commited me , whom he considered his dearest friend , and the provinces of Sicily and Africa , without which he was not able to protect Rome or Italy , to your protection . <end>
<start> Quid enim est illis optatius , quam uno tempore et nos circumvenire et vos nefario scelere obstringere ? aut quid irati gravius de vobis sentire possunt , quam ut eos prodatis , qui se vobis omnia debere iudicant , in eorum potestatem veniatis , qui se per vos perisse existimant ? An vero in Hispania res gestas Caesaris non audistis ? duos pulsos exercitus , duos superatos duces , duas receptas provincias ? haec acta diebus XL , quibus in conspectum adversariorum venerit Caesar ? An , qui incolumes resistere non potuerunt , perditi resistant ? vos autem incerta victoria Caesarem secuti diiudicata iam belli fortuna victum sequamini , cum vestri officii praemia percipere debeatis ? Desertos enim se ac proditos a vobis dicunt et prioris sacramenti mentionem faciunt . <end>$$<start> But did you desert Lucius Domitius , or did Lucius Domitius desert you ? Did he not , when you were ready to submit to the greatest difficulties , cast you off ? Did he not , without your privacy , endeavor to effect his own escape ? When you were betrayed by him , were you not preserved by Caesar's generosity ? And how could he think you bound by your oath to him , when , after having thrown up the ensigns of power , and abdicated his government , he became a private person , and a captive in another's power ? A new obligation is left upon you , that you should disregard the oath , by which you are at present bound ; and have respect only to that which was invalidated by the surrender of your general , and his diminution of rank . <end>
<start> Qui de meis in vos meritis praedicaturus non sum , quae sunt adhuc et mea voluntate et vestra exspectatione leviora ; sed tamen sui laboris milites semper eventu belli praemia petiverunt , qui qualis sit futurus , ne vos quidem dubitatis : diligentiam quidem nostram aut , quem ad finem adhuc res processit , fortunam cur praeteream ? An poenitet vos , quod salvum atque incolumem exercitum nulla omnino nave desiderata traduxerim ? quod classem hostium primo impetu adveniens profligaverim ? quod his per biduum equestri proelio superaverim ? quod ex portu sinuque adversariorum CC naves oneratas abduxerim eoque illos compulerim , ut neque pedestri itinere neque navibus commeatu iuvari possint ? Hac vos fortuna atque his ducibus repudiatis Corfiniensem ignominiam , Italiae fugam , Hispaniarum deditionem , Africi belli praeiudicia , sequimini! Equidem me Caesaris militem dici volui , vos me imperatoris nomine appellavistis . <end>$$<start> But why should I omit to mention my own diligence and good fortune , and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived ? Are you sorry that I transported the army safe and entire , without the loss of a single ship ? That on my arrival , in the very first attack , I routed the enemy's fleet ? That twice in two days I defeated the enemy's horse ? That I carried out of the very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy's victualers , and reduced them to that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or sea ? Will you divorce yourselves from this fortune and these generals ; and prefer the disgrace of Corfinium , the defeat of Italy , the surrender of both Spains , and the prestige of the African war ? I , for my part , wished to be called a soldier of Caesar's ; you honored me with the title of Imperator . <end>
<start> Cuius si vos poenitet , vestrum vobis beneficium remitto , mihi meum nomen restituite , ne ad contumeliam honorem dedisse videamini . <end>$$<start> If you repent your bounty , I give it back to you ; restore to me my former name that you may not appear to have conferred the honor on me as a reproach . <end>
<start> Qua oratione permoti milites crebro etiam dicentern interpellabant , ut magno cum dolore infidelitatis suspicionem sustinere viderentur , discedentem vero ex contione universi cohortantur , magno sit animo , necubi dubitet proelium committere et suam fidem virtutemque experiri . <end>$$<start> The soldiers , being affected by this oration , frequently attempted to interrupt him while he was speaking , so that they appeared to bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery , and when he was leaving the assembly they unanimously besought him to be of good spirits , and not hesitate to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and courage to a trial . <end>
<start> Quo facto commutata omnium et voluntate et opinione consensu summo constituit Curio , cum primum sit data potestas , proelio rem committere posteroque die productos eodem loco , quo superioribus diebus constiterat , in acie collocat . <end>$$<start> As the wishes and opinions of all were changed by this act , Curio , with the general consent , determined , whenever opportunity offered , to hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Erat vallis inter duas acies , ut supra demonstratum est , non ita magna , at difficili et arduo ascensu . <end>$$<start> There lay between the two armies a valley , as already mentioned , not very deep , but of a difficult and steep ascent . <end>
<start> Hanc uterque , si adversariorum copiae transire conarentur , exspectabat , quo aequiore loco proelium committeret . <end>$$<start> Each was waiting till the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it , that they might engage with the advantage of the ground . <end>
<start> Simul ab sinistro cornu Publius Attii equitatus omnis et una levis armaturae interiecti complures , cum se in vallem demitterent , cernebantur . <end>$$<start> At the same time on the left wing , the entire cavalry of Publius Attius , and several light-armed infantry intermixed with them , were perceived descending into the valley . <end>
<start> Ad eos Curio equitatum et duas Marrucinorum cohortes mittit ; quorum primum impetum equites hostium non tulerunt , sed admissis equis ad suos refugerunt ; relicti ab his , qui una procurrerant levis armaturae , circumveniebantur atque interficiebantur ab nostris . <end>$$<start> Against them Curio detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the Marrucini , whose first charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand , but , setting spurs to their horses , fled back to their friends : the light-infantry being deserted by those who had come out along with them , were surrounded and cut to pieces by our men . <end>
<start> Huc tota Vari conversa acies suos fugere et concidi videbat . <end>$$<start> Varus's whole army , facing that way , saw their men flee and cut down . <end>
<start> Tunc Rebilus , legatus Caesaris , quem Curio secum ex Sicilia duxerat , quod magnum habere usum in re militari sciebat , perterritum , inquit , hostem vides , Curio : quid dubitas uti temporis opportunitate ? Ille unum elocutus , ut memoria tenerent milites ea , quae pridie sibi confirmassent , sequi sese iubet et praecurrit ante omnes . <end>$$<start> Upon which Rebilus , one of Caesar's lieutenants , whom Curio had brought with him from Sicily knowing that he had great experience in military matters , cried out , You see the enemy are daunted , Curio! why do you hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity ? Curio , having merely expressed this , that the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which they had made to him the day before , then ordered them to follow him , and ran far before them all . <end>
<start> Adeo erat impedita vallis , ut in ascensu nisi sublevati a suis primi non facile eniterentur . <end>$$<start> The valley was so difficult of assent that the foremost men could not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind . <end>
<start> Sed praeoccupatus animus Attianorum militum timore et fuga et caede suorum nihil de resistendo cogitabat , omnesque se iam ab equitatu circumveniri arbitrabantur Itaque priusquam telum abici posset , aut nostri propius accederent , omnis Vari acies terga vertit seque in castra recepit . <end>$$<start> But the minds of Attius's soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the flight and slaughter of their men , never thought of opposing us ; and they all imagined that they were already surrounded by our horse , and , therefore , before a dart could be thrown , or our men come near them , Varus's whole army turned their backs and retreated to their camp . <end>
<start> Qua in fuga Fabius Pelignus quidam ex infimis ordinibus de exercitu Curionis primus agmen fugientium consecutus magna voce Varum nomine appellans requirebat , uti unus esse ex eius militibus et monere aliquid velle ac dicere videretur . <end>$$<start> In this flight one Fabius , a Pelignian common soldier in Curio's army , pursuing the enemy's rear , with a loud voice shouted to Varus by his name , and often called him , so that he seemed to be one of his soldiers , who wished to speak to him and give him advice . <end>
<start> Ubi ille saepius appellatus aspexit ac restitit et , quis esset aut quid vellet , quaesivit , umerum apertum gladio appetit paulumque afuit , quin Varum interficeret ; quod ille periculum sublato ad eius conatum scuto vitavit . <end>$$<start> When Varus , after been repeatedly called , stopped and looked at him , and inquired who he was and what he wanted , he made a blow with his sword at his naked shoulder and was very near killing Varus , but he escaped the danger by raising his shield to ward off the blow . <end>
<start> Sed cum loci natura et munitio castrorum aditum prohibebant , tum quod ad proelium egressi Curionis milites eis rebus indigebant , quae ad oppugnationem castrorum erant usui . <end>$$<start> But both the nature of the ground and the strength of the fortifications prevented our access to the camp ; for Curio's soldiers , marching out to battle , were without those things which were requisite for storming a camp . <end>
<start> Postero die Curio obsidere Uticam et vallo circummunire instituit . <end>$$<start> The next day Curio resolved to besiege Utica , and to draw lines about it . <end>
<start> Haec cum agerentur , nuntii praemissi ab rege Iuba venerunt , qui ilium adesse cum magnis copiis dicerent et de custodia ac defensione urbis hortarentur . <end>$$<start> The terror occasioned by former battles was very great ; and therefore , they openly talked of surrendering , and argued with Attius that he should not suffer the fortune of them all to be ruined by his obstinacy . <end>
<start> Nuntiabantur haec eadem Curioni , sed aliquamdiu fides fieri non poterat : tantam habebat suarum rerum fiduciam . <end>$$<start> The same intelligence was brought to Curio ; but for some time he could not give credit to it , because he had so great confidence in his own good fortune . <end>
<start> Iamque Caesaris in Hispania res secundae in Africam nuntiis ac litteris perferebantur . <end>$$<start> And at this time Caesar's success in Spain was announced in Africa by messages and letters . <end>
<start> Quibus omnibus rebus sublatus nihil contra se regem nisurum existimabat . <end>$$<start> Being elated by all these things , he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing against him . <end>
<start> Sed ubi certis auctoribus comperit minus V et XX milibus longe ab Utica eius copias abesse , relictis munitionibus sese in castra Cornelia recepit . <end>$$<start> But when he found out , from undoubted authority , that his forces were less than twenty miles distant from Utica , abandoning his works , he retired to the Cornelian camp . <end>
<start> Huc frumentum comportare , castra munire , materiam conferre coepit statimque in Siciliam misit , uti duae legiones reliquusque equitatus ad se mitteretur . <end>$$<start> Here he began to lay in corn and wood , and to fortify his camp , and immediately dispatched orders to Sicily , that his two legions and the remainder of his cavalry should be sent to him . <end>
<start> Castra erant ad bellum ducendum aptissima natura loci et munitione et maris propinquitate et aquae et salis copia , cuius magna vis iam ex proximis erat salinis eo congesta . <end>$$<start> His camp was well adapted for protracting a war , from the nature and strength of the situation , from its proximity to the sea , and the abundance of water and salt , of which a great quantity had been stored up from the neighboring salt-pits . <end>
<start> Non materia multitudine arborum , non frumentum , euius erant plenissimi agri , deficere poterat . <end>$$<start> Timber could not fail him from the number of trees , nor corn , with which the lands abounded . <end>
<start> Itaque omnium suorum consensu Curio reliquas copias exspectare et bellum ducere parabat . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , with the general consent , Curio determined to wait for the rest of his forces , and protract the war . <end>
<start> His constitutis rebus probatisque consiliis ex perfugis quibusdam oppidanis audit Iubam revocatum finitimo bello et controversiis Leptitanorum restitisse in regno , Saburram , eius praefectum , cum mediocribus copiis missum Uticae appropinquare . <end>$$<start> This plan being settled , and his conduct approved of , he is informed by some deserters from the town that Juba had staid behind in his own kingdom , being called home by a neighboring war , and a dispute with the people of Leptis ; and that Sabura , his commander-in-chief , who had been sent with a small force , was drawing near to Utica . <end>
<start> His auctoribus temere credens consilium commutat et proelio rem committere constituit . <end>$$<start> Curio rashly believing this information , altered his design , and resolved to hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Multum ad hanc rem probandam adiuvat adulescentia , magnitudo animi , superioris temporis proventus , fiducia rei bene gerendae . <end>$$<start> His youth , his spirits , his former good fortune and confidence of success , contributed much to confirm this resolution . <end>
<start> His rebus impulsus equitatum omnem prima nocte ad castra hostium mittit ad flumen Bagradam , quibus praeerat Saburra , de quo ante erat auditum ; sed rex omnibus copiis insequebatur et sex milium passuum intervallo a Saburra consederat . <end>$$<start> Induced by these motives , early in the night he sent all his cavalry to the enemy's camp near the river Bagrada , of which Sabura , of whom we have already spoken , was the commander . <end>
<start> Equites missi nocte iter conficiunt , imprudentes atque inopinantes hostes aggrediuntur . <end>$$<start> But the king was coming after them with all his forces , and was posted at a distance of six miles behind Sabura . <end>
<start> Hos oppressos somno et dispersos adorti magnum eorum numerum interficiunt ; multi perterriti profugiunt . <end>$$<start> The cavalry having attacked them , when sunk in sleep and dispersed , killed a great number of them ; many were frightened and ran away . <end>
<start> Quo facto ad Curionem equites revertuntur captivosque ad eum reducunt . <end>$$<start> After which the horse returned to Curio , and brought some , prisoners with them . <end>
<start> Curio cum omnibus copiis quarta vigilia exierat cohortibus V castris praesidio relictis . <end>$$<start> Curio had set out at the fourth watch with all his forces , except five cohorts which he left to guard the camp . <end>
<start> Progressus milia passuum VI equites convenit , rem gestam cognovit ; e captivis quaerit , quis castris ad Bagradam praesit : respondent Saburram . <end>$$<start> Having advanced six miles , he met the horse , heard what had happened and inquired from the captives who commanded the camp at Bagrada . <end>
<start> Reliqua studio itineris conficiendi quaerere praetermittit proximaque respiciens signa , videtisne , inquit , milites , captivorum orationem cum perfugis convenire ? abesse regem , exiguas esse copias missas , quae paucis equitibus pares esse non potuerint ? Proinde ad praedam , ad gloriam properate , ut iam de praemiis vestris et de referenda gratia cogitare incipiamus . <end>$$<start> They replied Sabura Through eagerness to perform his journey , he neglected to make further inquiries , but looking back to the company next him , Don't you see , soldiers , says he , that the answer of the prisoners corresponds with the account of the deserters , that the king is not with him , and that he sent only a small force which was not able to withstand a few horse ? Hasten then to spoil , to glory ; that we may now begin to think of rewarding you , and returning you thanks . <end>
<start> Erant per se magna , quae gesserant equites , praesertim cum eorum exiguus numerus cum tanta multitudine Numidarum confertur . <end>$$<start> The achievements of the horse were great in themselves , especially if their small number be compared with the vast host of Numidians . <end>
<start> Haec tamen ab ipsis inflatius commemorabantur , ut de suis homines laudibus libenter praedicant . <end>$$<start> However , the account was enlarged by themselves , as men are naturally inclined to boast of their own merit . <end>
<start> Multa praeterea spolia praeferebantur , capti homines equique producebantur , ut , quicquid intercederet temporis , hoc omne victoriam morari videretur . <end>$$<start> Besides , many spoils were produced ; the men and horses that were taken were brought into their sight , that they might imagine that every moment of time which intervened was a delay to their conquest . <end>
<start> Ita spei Curionis militum studia non deerant . <end>$$<start> By this means the hope of Curio were seconded by the ardor of the soldiers . <end>
<start> Equites sequi iubet sese iterque accelerat , ut quam maxime ex fuga perterritos adoriri posset . <end>$$<start> He ordered the horse to follow him , and hastened his march , that he might attack them as soon as possible , while in consternation after their flight . <end>
<start> At illi itinere totius noctis confecti subsequi non poterant , atque alii alio loco resistebant . <end>$$<start> But the horse , fatigued by the expedition of the preceding night , were not able to keep up with him , but fell behind in different places . <end>
<start> Ne haec quidem Curionem ad spem morabantur . <end>$$<start> Even this did not abate Curio's hopes . <end>
<start> Iuba certior factus a Saburra de nocturno proelio II milia Hispanorum et Gallorum equitum , quos suae custodiae causa circum se habere consuerat , et peditum eam partem , cui maxime confidebat , Saburrae submisit ; ipse cum reliquis copiis elephantisque LX lentius subsequitur . <end>$$<start> Juba , being informed by Sabura of the battle in the night , sent to his relief two thousand Spanish and Gallic horse , which he was accustomed to keep near him to guard his person , and that part of his infantry on which he had the greatest dependence , and he himself followed slowly after with the rest of his forces and forty elephants , suspecting that as Curio had sent his horse before , he himself would follow them . <end>
<start> Suspicatus praemissis equitibus ipsum affore Curionem Saburra copias equitum peditumque instruit atque his imperat , ut simulatione timoris paulatim cedant ac pedem referant : sese , cum opus esset , signum proelii daturum et , quod rem postulare cognovisset , imperaturum . <end>$$<start> Sabura drew up his army , both horse and foot , and commanded them to give way gradually and retreat through the pretense of fear ; that when it was necessary he would give them the signal for battle , and such orders as he found circumstances required . <end>
<start> Curio ad superiorem spem addita praesentis temporis olninione , hostes fugere arbitratus copias ex locis superioribus in campum deducit . <end>$$<start> Curio , as his idea of their present behavior was calculated to confirm his former hopes , imagined that the enemy were running away , and led his army from the rising grounds down to the plain . <end>
<start> Quibus ex locis cum longius esset progressus , confecto iam labore exercitu XII milium spatio constitit . <end>$$<start> And when he had advanced from this place about sixteen miles , his army being exhausted with the fatigue , he halted . <end>
<start> Dat suis signum Saburra , aciem constituit et circumire ordines atque hortari incipit ; sed peditatu dumtaxat procul ad speciem utitur , equites in aciem immittit . <end>$$<start> Sabura gave his men the signal , marshaled his army , and began to go around his ranks and encourage them . <end>
<start> Ne militibus quidem ut defessis neque equitibus ut paucis et labore confectis studium ad pugnandum virtusque deerat ; sed hi erant numero CC , reliqui in itinere substiterant . <end>$$<start> Neither were the soldiers , though wearied , nor the horse , though few and exhausted with fatigue , deficient in ardor to engage , and courage : but the latter were in number but two hundred : the rest had dropped behind on the march . <end>
<start> Hi , quamcumque in partem impetum fecerant , hostes loco cedere cogebant , sed neque longius fugientes prosequi neque vehementius equos incitare poterant . <end>$$<start> Wherever they charged they forced the enemy to give ground , but they were not able to pursue them far when they fled , or to press their horses too severely . <end>
<start> At equitatus hostium ab utroque cornu circuire aciem nostram et aversos proterere incipit . <end>$$<start> Besides , the enemy's cavalry began to surround us on both wings and to trample down our rear . <end>
<start> Cum cohortes ex acie procucurrissent , Numidae integri celeritate impetum nostrorum effugiebant rurusque ad ordines suos se recipientes circuibant et ab acie excludebant . <end>$$<start> When any cohorts ran forward out of the line , the Numidians , being fresh , by their speed avoided our charge , and surrounded ours when they attempted to return to their post , and cut them off from the main body . <end>
<start> Sic neque in loco manere ordinesque servare neque procurrere et casum subire tutum videbatur . <end>$$<start> So that it did not appear safe either to keep their ground and maintain their ranks , or to issue from the line , and run the risk . <end>
<start> Hostium copiae submissis ab rege auxiliis crebro augebantur ; nostros vires lassitudine deficiebant , simul ei , qui vulnera acceperant , neque acie excedere neque in locum tutum referri poterant , quod tota acies equitatu hostium circumdata tenebatur . <end>$$<start> The enemy's troops were frequently reinforced by assistance sent from Juba ; strength began to fail our men through fatigue ; and those who had been wounded could neither quit the field nor retire to a place of safety , because the whole field was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry . <end>
<start> Hi de sua salute desperantes , ut extremo vitae tempore homines facere consuerunt , aut suam mortem miserabantur aut parentes suos commendabant , si quos ex eo periculo fortuna servare potuisset . <end>$$<start> Therefore , despairing of their own safety , as men usually do in the last moment of their lives , they either lamented their unhappy deaths , or recommended their parents to the survivors , if fortune should save any from the impending danger . <end>
<start> Plena erant omnia timoris et luctus . <end>$$<start> All were full of fear and grief . <end>
<start> Curio , ubi perterritis omnibus neque cohortationes suas neque preces audiri intellegit , unam ut in miseris rebus spem reliquam salutis esse arbitratus , proximos colles capere universos atque eo signa inferri iubet . <end>$$<start> When Curio perceived that in the general consternation neither his exhortations nor entreaties were attended to , imagining that the only hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to gain the nearest hills , he ordered the colors to be borne that way . <end>
<start> Tum vero ad summam desperationem nostri perveniunt et partim fugientes ab equitatu interficiuntur , partim integri procumbunt . <end>$$<start> But a party of horse , that had been sent by Sabura , had already got possession of them . <end>
<start> Hortatur Curionem Gnaeus Domitius , praefectus equitum , cum paucis equitibus circumsistens , ut fuga salutem petat atque in castra contendat , et se ab eo non discessurum pollicetur . <end>$$<start> Now indeed our men were reduced to extreme despair : and some of them were killed by the cavalry in attempting to escape : some fell to the ground unhurt . <end>
<start> At Curio numquam se amisso exercitu , quem a Caesare fidei commissum acceperit , in eius conspectum reversurum confirmat atqne ita proelians interficitur . <end>$$<start> Cneius Domitius , commander of the cavalry , standing round Curio with a small party of horse , urged Curio to endeavor to escape by flight , and to hasten to his camp ; and assured him that he would not forsake him . <end>
<start> Equites ex proelio perpauci se recipiunt ; sed ei , quos ad novissimum agmen equorum reficiendorum causa substitisse demonstratum est , fuga totius exercitus procul animadversa sese incolumes in castra conferunt . <end>$$<start> But Curio declared that he would never more appear in Caesar's sight , after losing the army which had been committed by Caesar , to his charge , and accordingly fought till he was killed . <end>
<start> His rebus cognitis Marcius Rufus quaestor in castris relictus a Curione cohortatur suos , ne animo deficiant . <end>$$<start> The soldiers were all killed to a man Marcus Rufus , the quaestor , who was left behind in the camp by Curio , having got intelligence of these things , encouraged his men not to be disheartened . <end>
<start> Illi orant atque obsecrant , ut in Siciliam navibus reportentur . <end>$$<start> They beg and entreat to be transported to Sicily . <end>
<start> Pollicetur magistrisque imperat navium , ut primo vespere omnes scaphas ad litus appulsas habeant . <end>$$<start> He consented , and ordered the masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore early in the evening . <end>
<start> Sed tantus fuit omnium terror , ut alii adesse copias Iubae dicerent , alii cum legionibus instare Varum iamque se pulverem venientium cernere , quarum rerum nihil omnino acciderat , alii classem hostium celeriter advolaturam suspicarentur . <end>$$<start> But so great was the terror in general , that some said that Juba's forces were marching up , others that Varus was hastening with his legions , and that they already saw the dust raised by their coming ; of which not one circumstance had happened : others suspected that the enemy's fleet would immediately be upon them . <end>
<start> Itaque perterritis omnibus sibi quisque consulebat . <end>$$<start> Therefore in the general consternation , every man consulted his own safety . <end>
<start> Horum fuga navium onerariarum magistros incitabat ; pauci lenunculi ad officium imperiumque conveniebant . <end>$$<start> A few small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders . <end>
<start> Sed tanta erat completis litoribus contentio , qui potissimum ex magno numero conscenderent , ut multitudine atque onere nonnulli deprimerentur , reliqui hoc timore propius adire tardarentur . <end>$$<start> But as the shores were crowded , so great was the struggle to determine who of such a vast number should first get on board , that some of the vessels sank with the weight of the multitude , and the fears of the rest delayed them from coming to the shore . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus accidit , ut pauci milites patresque familiae , qui aut gratia aut misericordia valerent aut naves adnare possent , recepti in Siciliam incolumes pervenirent . <end>$$<start> From which circumstances it happened that a few foot and aged men , that could prevail either through interest or pity , or who were able to swim to the ships , were taken on board , and landed safe in Sicily . <end>
<start> Ipse equo in oppidum vectus prosequentibus compluribus senatoribus , quo in numero erat Ser Sulpicius et Licinius Damasippus paucis , quae fieri vellet , Uticae constituit atque imperavit diebusque post paucis se in regnum cum omnibus copiis recepit . <end>$$<start> But Juba the next day having spied their cohorts before the town , claimed them as his booty , and ordered great part of them to be put to the sword ; a few he selected and sent home to his own realm . <end>
<start> Dictatore habente comitia Caesare consules creantur Iulius Caesar et Publius Servilius : is enim erat annus , quo per leges ei consulem fieri liceret . <end>$$<start> Julius Caesar , holding the election as dictator , was himself appointed consul with Publius Servilius ; for this was the year in which it was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul . <end>
<start> His rebus confectis , cum fides tota Italia esset angustior neque creditae pecuniae solverentur , constituit , ut arbitri darentur ; per eos fierent aestimationes possessionum et rerum , quanti quaeque earum ante bellum fuisset , atque hac creditoribus traderentur . <end>$$<start> This business being ended , as credit was beginning to fail in Italy , and the debts could not be paid , he determined that arbitrators should be appointed : and that they should make an estimate of the possessions and properties of the debtors , how much they were worth before the war , and that they should be handed over in payment to the creditors . <end>
<start> Hoc et ad timorem novarum tabularum tollendum minuendumve , qui fere bella et civiles dissensiones sequi consuevit , et ad debitorum tuendam existimationem esse aptissimum existimavit . <end>$$<start> This he thought the most likely method to remove and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt , the usual consequence of civil wars and dissensions , and to support the credit of the debtors . <end>
<start> Itemque praetoribus tribunisque plebis rogationes ad populum ferentibus nonnullos ambitus Pompeia lege damnatos illis temporibus , quibus in urbe praesidia legionum Pompeius habuerat , quae iudicia aliis audientibus iudicibus , aliis sententiam ferentibus singulis diebus erant perfecta , in integrum restituit , qui se illi initio civilis belli obtulerant , si sua opera in bello uti vellet , proinde aestimans , ac si usus esset , quoniam aui fecissent potestatem . <end>$$<start> He likewise restored to their former condition (the praetors and tribunes , first submitting the question to the people) some persons condemned for bribery at the elections , by virtue of Pompey's law , at the time when Pompey kept his legions quartered in the city (these trials were finished in a single day , one judge hearing the merits , and another pronouncing the sentences) , because they had offered their service to him in the beginning of the civil war , if he chose to accept them ; setting the same value on them as if he had accepted them , because they had put themselves in his power . <end>
<start> Statuerat enim prius hos iudicio populi debere restitui , quam suo beneficio videri receptos , ne aut ingratus in referenda gratia aut arrogans in praeripiendo populi beneficio videretur . <end>$$<start> For he had determined that they ought to be restored rather by the judgment of the people than appear admitted to it by his bounty : that he might neither appear ungrateful in repaying an obligation , nor arrogant in depriving the people of their prerogative of exercising this bounty . <end>
<start> His rebus et feriis Latinis comitiisque omnibus perficiendis XI dies tribuit dictaturaque se abdicat et ab urbe proficiscitur Brundisiumque pervenit . <end>$$<start> In accomplishing these things , and celebrating the Latin festival , and holding all the elections , he spent eleven days ; and having resigned the dictatorship , set out from the city , and went to Brundusium , where he had ordered twelve legions and all his cavalry to meet him . <end>
<start> Eo legiones XII , equitatum omnem venire iusserat Sed tantum navium repperit , ut anguste XV milia legionariorum militum , DC equites transportari possent . <end>$$<start> But he scarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to transport fifteen thousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse . <end>
<start> Atque hae ipsae copiae hoc infrequentiores imponuntur , quod multi Gallicis tot bellis defecerant , longumque iter ex Hispania magnum numerum deminuerat , et gravis autumnus in Apulia circumque Brundisium ex saluberrimis Galliae et Hispaniae regionibus omnem exercitum valetudine temptaverat . <end>$$<start> And even these troops embarked very short of their number , because several had fallen in so many wars in Gaul , and the long march from Spain had lessened their number very much , and a severe autumn in Apulia and the district about Brundusium , after the very wholesome countries of Spain and Gaul , had impaired the health of the whole army . <end>
<start> Legiones effecerat civium Romanorum VIIII : V ex Italia , quas traduxerat ; unam ex Cilicia veteranam , quam factam ex duabus gemellam appellabat ; unam ex Creta et Macedonia ex veteranis militibus , qui dimissi a superioribus imperatoribus in his provinciis consederant ; duas ex Asia , quas Lentulus consul conscribendas curaverat . <end>$$<start> He had made up nine legions of Roman citizens ; five from Italy , which he had brought with him ; one veteran legion from Sicily , which being composed of two he called the Gemella ; one from Crete and Macedonia , of veterans who had been discharged by their former generals and had settled in those provinces ; two from Asia , which had been levied by the activity of Lentulus . <end>
<start> Praeterea magnum numerum ex Thessalia , Boeotia , Achaia Epiroque supplementi nomine in legiones distribuerat : his Antonianos milites admiscuerat . <end>$$<start> Besides , he had distributed among his legions a considerable number , by way of recruits , from Thessaly , Boeotia , Achaia , and Epirus : with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken from Caius Antonius . <end>
<start> Sagittarios Creta , Lacedaemone , ex Ponto atque Syria reliquisque civitatibus III milia numero habebat , funditorum cohortes sescenarias II , equitum VII milia . <end>$$<start> Two hundred were sent from Syria by Comagenus Antiochus , whom Pompey rewarded amply . <end>
<start> Huc Dardanos , Bessos partim mercenarios , partim imperio aut gratia comparatos , item Macedones , Thessalos ac reliquarum gentium et civitatum adiecerat atque eum , quem supra demonstravimus , numerum expleverat . <end>$$<start> To these were added Dardanians and Bessians , some of them mercenaries ; others procured by power and influence : also , Macedonians , Thessalians , and troops from other nations and states , which completed the number which we mentioned before . <end>
<start> Frumenti vim maximam ex Thessalia , Asia , Aegypto , Creta , Cyrenis reliquisque regionibus comparaverat . <end>$$<start> He had laid in vast quantities of corn from Thessaly , Asia , Egypt , Crete , Cyrene , and other countries . <end>
<start> Hiemare Dyrrachii , Apolloniae omnibusque oppidis maritimis constituerat , ut mare transire Caesarem prohiberet , eiusque rei causa omni ora maritima classem disposuerat . <end>$$<start> He had resolved to fix his winter quarters at Dyrrachium , Apollonia , and the other seaports , to hinder Caesar from passing the sea : and for this purpose had stationed his fleet along the sea-coast . <end>
<start> Laelius et Gaius Triarius , Syriacis Gaius Cassius , Rhodiis Gaius Marcellus cum Gaius Coponio , Liburnicae atque Achaicae classi Scribonius Libo et Marcus Octavius . <end>$$<start> But Marcus Bibulus was appointed commander-in-chief of the whole maritime department , and regulated every matter . <end>
<start> Caesar , ut Brundisium venit , contionatus apud milites , quoniam prope ad finem laborum ac periculorum esset perventum , aequo animo mancipia atque impedimenta in Italia relinquerent , ipsi expediti naves conscenderent , quo maior numerus militum posset imponi , omniaque ex victoria et ex sua liberalitate sperarent , conclamantibus omnibus , imperaret , quod vellet , quodcumque imperavisset , se aequo animo esse facturos , II . <end>$$<start> When Caesar came to Brundusium , he made a speech to the soldiers : That since they were now almost arrived at the termination of their toils and dangers , they should patiently submit to leave their slaves and baggage in Italy , and to embark without luggage , that a greater number of men might be put on board : that they might expect every thing from victory and his liberality . <end>
<start> Non Ian naves solvit Impositae , ut supra demonstratum est , legiones VII . <end>$$<start> They cried out with one voice , he might give what orders he pleased , that they would cheerfully fulfill them . <end>
<start> Inter Cerauniorum saxa et alia loca periculosa quietam nactus stationem et portus omnes timens , quos teneri ab adversariis arbitrabatur , ad eum locum , qui appellabatur Palaeste , omnibus navibus ad unam incolumibum milites euit . <end>$$<start> The next day he reached land , between the Ceraunian rocks and other dangerous places ; meeting with a safe road for his shipping to ride in , and dreading all other ports which he imagined were in possession of the enemy , he landed his men at a place called Pharsalus , without the loss of a single vessel . <end>
<start> Erat Orici Lucretius Vespillo et Minucius Rufus cum Asiaticis navibus XVIII , quibus iussu D Laelii praeerant , Marcus Bibulus cum navibus ex Corcyrae . <end>$$<start> Lucretius Vespillo and Minutius Rufus were at Oricum , with eighteen Asiatic ships , which were given into their charge by the orders of Decimus Laelius : Marcus Bibulus at Corcyra , with a hundred and ten ships . <end>
<start> Sed neque illi sibi confisi ex portu prodire sunt ausi , cum Caesar omnino XII naves longas praesidio duxisset , in quibus erant constratae IIII , neque Bibulus impeditis navibus dispersisque remigibus satis mature occurrit , quod prius ad continentem visus est Caesar , quam de eius adventu fama omnino in eas regiones perferretur . <end>$$<start> But they had not the confidence to dare to move out of the harbor ; though Caesar had brought only twelve ships as a convoy , only four of which had decks ; nor did Bibulus , his fleet being disordered and his seamen dispersed , come up in time : for Caesar was seen at the continent , before any account whatsoever of his approach had reached those regions . <end>
<start> Eitis militibus naves eadem nocte Brundisium a Caesare remittuntur , ut reliquae legiones equitatusque transportari possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having landed his soldiers , sent back his ships the same night to Brundusium , to transport the rest of his legions and cavalry . <end>
<start> Huic officio praepositus erat Fufius Calenus legatus , qui celeritatem in transportandis legionibus adhiberet . <end>$$<start> The charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius Kalenus , with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions . <end>
<start> Sed serius a terra provectae naves neque usae nocturna aura in redeundo offenderunt . <end>$$<start> But the ships having put to sea too late , and not having taken advantage of the night breeze , fell a sacrifice on their return . <end>
<start> Bibulus enim Corcyrae certior factus de adventu Caesaris , sperans alicui se parti onustarum navium occurrere posse , inanibus occurrit et nactus circiter XXX in eas indiligentiae suae ac doloris iracundiam erupit omnesque incendit eodemque igne nautas dominosque navium interfecit , magnitudine poenae reliquos terreri sperans . <end>$$<start> For Bibulus at Corcyra , being informed of Caesar's approach , hoped to fall in with some part of our ships , with their cargoes , but found them empty ; and having taken about thirty , vented on them his rage at his own remissness , and set them all on fire : and , with the same flames , he destroyed the mariners and masters of the vessels , hoping by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest . <end>
<start> Discessu Liburnarum ex Illyrico Marcus Octavius cum eis , quas habebat , navibus Salonas pervenit Ibi concitatis Dalmatis reliquisque barbaris Issam a Caesaris amicitia avertit ; conventurn Salonis cum neque pollicitationibus neque denuntiatione periculi permovere posset , oppidum oppugnare instituit . <end>$$<start> But after the departure Of the Liburnian fleet , Marcus Octavius sailed from Illyricum with what ships he had to Salona , and having spirited up the Dalmatians , and other barbarous nations , he drew Issa off from its connection with Caesar ; but not being able to prevail with the council of Salona , either by promises or menaces , he resolved to storm the town . <end>
<start> Est autem oppidum et loci natura et colle munitum . <end>$$<start> But it was well fortified by its natural situation and a hill . <end>
<start> Sed celeriter cives Romani ligneis effectis turribus his sese munierunt et , cum essent infirmi ad resistendum propter paucitatem hominum crebris confecti vulneribus , ad extremum auxilium descenderunt servosque omnes puberes liberaverunt et praesectis omnium mulierum crinibus tormenta effecerunt . <end>$$<start> The Roman citizens built wooden towers , the better to secure it ; but when they were unable to resist , on account of the smallness of their numbers , being weakened by several wounds , they stooped to the last resource , and set at liberty all the slaves old enough to bear arms ; and cutting the hair off the women's heads , made ropes for their engines . <end>
<start> Quorum cognita sententia Octavius quinis castris oppidum circumdedit atque uno tempore obsidione et oppugnationibus eos premere coepit . <end>$$<start> Octavius , being informed of their determination , surrounded the town with five encampments , and began to press them at once with a siege and storm . <end>
<start> Illi omnia perpeti parati maxime a re frumentaria laborabant . <end>$$<start> They were determined to endure every hardship , and their greatest distress was the want of corn . <end>
<start> Cui rei missis ad Caesarem legatis auxilium ab eo petebant ; reliqua , ut poterant , incommoda per se sustinebant Et longo interposito spatio cum diuturnitas oppugnationis neglegentiores Octavianos effecisset , nacti occasionem meridiani temporis discessu eorum pueris mulieribusque in muro dispositis , ne quid cotidianae consuetudinis desideraretur , ipsi manu facta cum eis , quos nuper liberaverant , in proxima Octavii castra irruperunt . <end>$$<start> They , therefore , sent deputies to Caesar , and begged a supply from him ; all other inconveniences they bore by their own resources , as well as they could : and after a long interval , when the length of the siege had made Octavius's troops more remiss than usual , having got an opportunity at noon , when the enemy were dispersed , they disposed their wives and children on the walls , to keep up the appearance of their usual attention ; and forming themselves into one body , with the slaves whom they had lately enfranchised , they made an attack on Octavius's nearest camp , and having forced that , attacked the second with the same fury ; and then the third and the fourth , and then the other , and beat them from them all : and having killed a great number , obliged the rest and Octavius himself to fly for refuge to their ships . <end>
<start> Iamque hiems appropinquabat , et tantis detrimentis acceptis Octavius desperata oppugnatione oppidi Dyrrachium sese ad Pompeium recepit . <end>$$<start> Winter was now approaching , and Octavius , despairing of capturing the town , after sustaining such considerable losses , withdrew to Pompey , to Dyrrachium . <end>
<start> Demonstravimus Lucius Vibullium Rufum , Pompei praefectum , bis in potestatem pervenisse Caesaris atque ab eo esse dimissum , semel ad Corfinium , iterum in Hispania . <end>$$<start> We have mentioned , that Vibullius Rufus , an officer of Pompey's had fallen twice into Caesar's power ; first at Corfinium , and afterward in Spain . <end>
<start> Hunc pro suis beneficiis Caesar idoneum iudicaverat , quem cum mandatis ad Gnaeus Pompeium mitteret , eundemque apud Gnaeus Pompeium auctoritatem habere intellegebat Erat autem haec summa mandatorum : debere utrumque pertinaciae finem facere et ab armis discedere neque amplius fortunam periclitari . <end>$$<start> Caesar thought him a proper person , on account of his favors conferred on him , to send with proposals to Pompey : and he knew that he had an influence over Pompey . <end>
<start> Satis esse magna utrimque incommoda accepta , quae pro disciplina et praeceptis habere possent , ut reliquos casus timerent : ilium Italia expulsum amissa Sicilia et Sardinia duabusque Hispaniis et cohortibus in Italia atque Hispania civium Romanorum centum atque XXX ; se morte Curionis et detrimento Africani exercitus tanto militumque deditione ad Curictam . <end>$$<start> This was the substance of his proposals : That it was the duty of both , to put an end to their obstinacy , and forbear hostilities , and not tempt fortune any further ; that sufficient loss had been suffered on both sides , to serve as a lesson and instruction to them , to render them apprehensive of future calamities , by Pompey , in having been driven out of Italy , and having lost Sicily , Cardinia , and the two Spains , and one hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens , in Italy and Spain : by himself , in the death of Curio , and the loss of so great an army in Africa , and the surrender of his soldiers in Corcyra . <end>
<start> Proinde sibi ac rei publicae parcerent , cum , quantum in bello fortuna posset , iam ipsi incommodis suis satis essent documento . <end>$$<start> Wherefore , they should have pity on themselves , and the republic : for , from their own misfortunes , they had sufficient experience of what fortune can effect in war . <end>
<start> Interea et rei publicae et ipsis placere oportere , si uterque in contione statim iuravisset se triduo proximo exercitum dimissurum . <end>$$<start> Since , if fortune showed ever so little favor to either , he who thought himself superior , would not submit to terms of accommodation ; nor would be content with an equal division , when he might expect to obtain the whole . <end>
<start> Depositis armis auxiliisque , quibus nunc confiderent , necessario populi senatusque iudicio fore utrumque contentum . <end>$$<start> That as they could not agree before , the terms of peace ought to be submitted to the senate and people in Rome . <end>
<start> Vibullius eitus Corcyrae non minus necessarium esse existimavit de repentino adventu Caesaris Pompeium fieri certiorem , uti ad id consilium capere posset , antequam de mandatis agi inciperetur , atque ideo continuato nocte ac die itinere atque omnibus oppidis mutatis ad celeritatem iumentis ad Pompeium contendit , ut adesse Caesarem nuntiaret . <end>$$<start> Vibullius , having received this commission from Caesar , thought it no less necessary to give Pompey notice of Caesar's sudden approach , that he might adopt such plans as the circumstance required , than to inform him of Caesar's message ; and therefore continuing his journey by night as well as by day , and taking fresh horses for dispatch , he posted away to Pompey , to inform him that Caesar was marching toward him with all his forces . <end>
<start> Pompeius erat eo tempore in Candavia iterque ex Macedonia in hiberna Apolloniam Dyrrachiumque habebat Sed re nova perturbatus maioribus itineribus Apolloniam petere coepit , ne Caesar orae maritimae civitates occuparet . <end>$$<start> Pompey was at this time in Candavia , and was on his march from Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and Dyrrachium ; but surprised at the unexpected news , he determined to go to Apollonia by speedy marches , to prevent Caesar from becoming master of all the maritime states . <end>
<start> Quo cum venisset , Lucius Torquatus , qui iussu Pompei oppido praeerat praesidiumque ibi Parthinorum habebat , conatus portis clausis oppidum defendere , cum Graecos murum ascendere atque arma capere iuberet , illi autem se contra imperium populi Romani pugnaturos esse negarent , oppidani autem etiam sua sponte Caesarem recipere conarentur , desperatis omnibus auxiliis portas aperuit et se atque oppidum Caesari dedidit incolumisque ab eo conservatus est . <end>$$<start> But as they refused to fight against the power of the Roman people , and as the citizens made a spontaneous attempt to admit Caesar , despairing of any assistance , he threw open the gates , and surrendered himself and the town to Caesar , and was preserved safe from injury by him . <end>
<start> Recepto Caesar Orico nulla interposita mora Apolloniam proficiscitur . <end>$$<start> Having taken Oricum , Caesar marched without making any delay to Apollonia . <end>
<start> Cuius adventu audito Lucius Staberius , qui ibi praeerat , aquam comportare in arcem atque eam munire obsidesque ab Apolloniatibus exigere coepit . <end>$$<start> Staberius the governor , hearing of his approach , began to bring water into the citadel , and to fortify it , and to demand hostages of the town's people . <end>
<start> Illi vero daturos se negare , neque portas consuli praeclusuros , neque sibi iudicium sumpturos contra atque omnis Italia populusque Romanus indicavisset . <end>$$<start> But they refuse to give any , or to shut their gates against the consul , or to take upon them to judge contrary to what all Italy and the Roman people had judged . <end>
<start> Quorum cognita voluntate clam profugit Apollonia Staberius . <end>$$<start> As soon as he knew their inclinations , he made his escape privately . <end>
<start> Illi ad Caesarem legatos mittunt oppidoque recipiunt . <end>$$<start> The inhabitants of Apollonia sent embassadors to Caesar , and gave him admission into their town . <end>
<start> Hos sequnntur Bullidenses , Amantini et reliquae finitimae civitates totaque Epiros et legatis ad Caesarem missis , quae imperaret , facturos pollicentur . <end>$$<start> Their example was followed by the inhabitants of Bullis , Amantia , and the other neighboring states , and all Epirus : and they sent embassadors to Caesar , and promised to obey his commands . <end>
<start> At Pompeins cognitis his rebus , quae erant Orici atque Apolloniae gestae , Dyrrachio timens diurnis eo nocturnisque itineribus contendit . <end>$$<start> But Pompey having received information of the transactions at Oricum and Apollonia , began to be alarmed for Dyrrachium , and endeavored to reach it , marching day and night . <end>
<start> Simul Caesar appropinquare dicebatur , tantusque terror incidit eius exercitui , quod properans noctem diei coniunxerat neque iter intermiserat , ut paene omnes ex Epiro finitimisque regionibus signa relinquerent , complures arma proicerent ac fugae simile iter videretur . <end>$$<start> As soon as it was said that Caesar was approaching , such a panic fell upon Pompey's army , because in his haste he had made no distinction between night and day , and had marched without intermission , that they almost every man deserted their colors in Epirus and the neighboring countries ; several threw down their arms , and their march had the appearance of a flight . <end>
<start> Sed cum prope Dyrrachium Pompeius constitisset castraque metari iussisset , perterrito etiam tum exercitu princeps Labienus procedit iuratque se eum non deserturum eundemque casum subiturum , quemcumque ei fortuna tribuisset . <end>$$<start> But when Pompey had halted near Dyrrachium , and had given orders for measuring out the ground for his camp , his army even yet continuing in their fright , Labienus first stepped forward and swore that he would never desert him , and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to him . <end>
<start> Hoc idem reliqui iurant legati ; tribuni militum centurionesque sequuntur , atque idem omnis exercitus iurat . <end>$$<start> The other lieutenants took the same oath , and the tribunes and centurions followed their example : and the whole army swore in like manner . <end>
<start> Caesar praeoccupato itinere ad Dyrrachium finem properandi facit castraque ad flumen Apsum ponit in finibus Apolloniatium , ut bene meritae civitates tutae essent praesidio , ibique reliquarum ex Italia legionum adventum exspectare et sub pellibus hiemare constituit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , finding the road to Dyrrachium already in the possession of Pompey , was in no great haste , but encamped by the river Apsus , in the territory of Apollonia , that the states which had deserved his support might be certain of protection from his out-guards and forts ; and there he resolved to wait the arrival of his other legions from Italy , and to winter in tents . <end>
<start> Hoc idem Pompeius fecit et trans flumen Apsum positis castris eo copias omnes auxiliaque conduxit . <end>$$<start> Pompey did the same ; and pitching his camp on the other side of the river Apsus , collected there all his troops and auxiliaries . <end>
<start> Calenus legionibus equitibusque Brundisii in naves impositis , ut erat praeceptum a Caesare , quantum navium facultatem habebat , naves solvit paulumque a portu progressus litteras a Caesare accipit , quibus est certior factus portus litoraque omnia classibus adversariorum teneri . <end>$$<start> Kalenus , having put the legions and cavalry on board at Brundusium , as Caesar had directed him , as far as the number of his ships allowed , weighed anchor : and having sailed a little distance from port , received a letter from Caesar , in which he was informed , that all the ports and the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet : on receiving this information he returned into the harbor , and recalled all the vessels . <end>
<start> Quo cognito se in portum recipit navesque omnes revocat Una ex his , quae perseveravit neque imperio Caleni obtemperavit , quod erat sine militibus privatoque consilio administrabatur , delata Oricum atque a Bibulo expugnata est ; qui de servis liberisque omnibus ad impuberes supplicium sumit et ad unum interficit . <end>$$<start> One of them , which continued the voyage and did not obey Kalenus's command , because it carried no troops , but was private property , bore away for Oricum , and was taken by Bibulus , who spared neither slaves nor free men , nor even children ; but put all to the sword . <end>
<start> Ita exiguo tempore magnoque casu totius exercitus salus constitit . <end>$$<start> Thus the safety of the whole army depended on a very short space of time and a great casualty . <end>
<start> Bibulus , ut supra demonstratum est , erat cum classe ad Oricum et , sicuti mari portibusque Caesarem prohibebat , ita ipse omni terra earurn regionum prohibebatur ; praesidiis enim dispositis omnia litora a Caesare tenebantur , neque lignandi atque aquandi neque naves ad terram religandi potestas fiebat . <end>$$<start> Bibulus , as has been observed before , lay with his fleet near Oricum , and as he debarred Caesar of the liberty of the sea and harbors , so he was deprived of all intercourse with the country by land ; for the whole shore was occupied by parties disposed in different places by Caesar . <end>
<start> Sed cum essent in quibus demonstravi angustiis , ac se Libo cum Bibulo coniunxisset , loquuntur ambo ex navibus cum Marcus Acilio et Statio Murco legatis ; quorum alter oppidi muris , alter praesidiis terrestribus praeerat : velle se de maximis rebus cum Caesare loqui , si sibi eius rei facultas detur . <end>$$<start> He was reduced to great difficulties , and distressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary ; insomuch that he was obliged to bring , in transports from Corcyra , not only provisions , but even wood and water ; and it once happened that , meeting with violent storms , they were forced to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that covered their decks ; yet all these difficulties they bore patiently and without repining , and thought they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free from blockade . <end>
<start> Interim postulant ut sint indutiae , atque ab eis impetrant . <end>$$<start> They add something further to strengthen the impression that they intended to treat about an accommodation . <end>
<start> Magnum enim , quod afferebant , videbatur , et Caesarem id summe sciebant cupere , et profectum aliquid Vibullil mandatis existimabatur . <end>$$<start> In the mean time they requested a truce , and obtained it from them ; for what they proposed seemed to be of importance , and it was well known that Caesar desired it above all things , and it was imagined that some advantage would be derived from Bibulus's proposals . <end>
<start> Caesar eo tempore cum legione una profectus ad recipiendas ulteriores civitates et rem frumentariam expediendam , qua angusta utebatur , erat ad Buthrotum , oppidum oppositum Corcyrae . <end>$$<start> Caesar having set out with one legion to gain possession of the more remote states , and to provide corn , of which he had but a small quantity , was at this time at Buthrotum , opposite to Corcyra . <end>
<start> Ibi certior ab Acilio et Murco per litteras factus de postulatis Libonis et Bibuli legionem relinquit ; ipse Oricum revertitur . <end>$$<start> There receiving Acilius and Marcus's letters , informing him of Libo's and Bibulus's demands , he left his legion behind him , and returned himself to Oricum . <end>
<start> Eo cum venisset , evocantur illi ad colloquium . <end>$$<start> When he arrived , they were invited to a conference . <end>
<start> Prodit Libo atque excusat Bibulum , quod is iracundia summa erat inimicitiasque habebat etiam privatas cum Caesare ex aedilitate et praetura conceptas : ob eam causam colloquium vitasse , ne res maximae spei maximaeque utilitatis eius iracundia impedirentur . <end>$$<start> Libo came and made an apology for Bibulus , that he was a man of strong passion , and had a private quarrel against Caesar , contracted when he was aedile and praetor ; that for this reason he had avoided the conference , lest affairs of the utmost importance and advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper . <end>
<start> Suam summam esse ac fuisse semper voluntatem , ut componeretur atque ab armis discederetur , sed potestatem eius rei nullam habere , propterea quod de consilii sententia summam belli rerumque omnium Pompeio permiserint . <end>$$<start> That it now was and ever had been Pompey's most earnest wish , that they should be reconciled and lay down their arms , but they were not authorized to treat on that subject , because they resigned the whole management of the war , and all other matters to Pompey , by order of the council . <end>
<start> Sed postulatis Caesaris cognitis missuros ad Pompeium , atque illum reliqua per se acturum hortantibus ipsis . <end>$$<start> But when they were acquainted with Caesar's demands , they would transmit them to Pompey , who would conclude all of himself by their persuasions . <end>
<start> Interea manerent indutiae , dum ab illo rediri posset , neve alter alteri noceret . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , let the truce be continued till the messengers could return from him ; and let no injury be done on either side . <end>
<start> Huc addit pauca de causa et de copiis auxiliisque suis . <end>$$<start> To this he added a few words of the cause for which they fought , and of his own forces and resources . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus neque tum respondendum Caesar existimavit , neque nunc , ut memoriae prodantur , satis causae putamus . <end>$$<start> To this , Caesar did not then think proper to make any reply , nor do we now think it worth recording . <end>
<start> Postulabat Caesar , ut legatos sibi ad Pompeium sine periculo mittere liceret , idque ipsi fore reciperent aut acceptos per se ad eum perducerent . <end>$$<start> But Caesar required that he should be allowed to send commissioners to Pompey , who should suffer no personal injury ; and that either they should grant it , or should take his commissioners in charge , and convey them to Pompey . <end>
<start> Nihilo minus tamen agi posse de compositione , ut haec non remitterentur , neque hanc rem illi esse impedimento . <end>$$<start> They would neither receive Caesar's commissioners , nor guarantee their safety , but referred the whole to Pompey . <end>
<start> Quem ubi Caesar intellexit praesentis periculi atque inopiae vitandae causa omnem orationem instituisse neque ullam spem aut condicionem pacis afferre , ad reliquam cogitationem belli sese recepit . <end>$$<start> But when Caesar perceived that they had proposed the conference merely to avoid present danger and distress , but that they offered no hopes or terms of peace , he applied his thoughts to the prosecution of the war . <end>
<start> Bibulus multos dies terra prohibitus et graviore morbo ex frigore et labore implicitus , cum neque curari posset neque susceptum officium deserere vellet , vim morbi sustinere non potuit Eo mortuo ad neminem unum summa imperii redit , sed separatim suam quisque classem ad arbitrium suum administrabat . <end>$$<start> Bibulus , being prevented from landing for several days , and being seized with a violent distemper from the cold and fatigue , as he could neither be cured on board , nor was willing to desert the charge which he had taken upon him , was unable to bear up against the violence of the disease . <end>
<start> Vibullius sedato tumultu , quem repentinus adventus Caesaris concitaverat , ubi primum e re visum est , adhibito Libone et Lucius Lucceio et Theophane , quibuscum communicare de maximis rebus Pompeius consueverat , de mandatis Caesaris agere instituit . <end>$$<start> On his death , the sole command devolved on no single individual , but each admiral managed his own division separately , and at his own discretion . <end>
<start> Quid mihi , inquit , aut vita aut civitate opus est , quam beneficio Caesaris habere videbor ? cuius rei opinio tolli non poterit , cum in Italiam , ex qua profectus sum , reductus existimabor bello periecto . <end>$$<start> After the conclusion of the war , Caesar was informed of these expressions by some persons who were present at the conversation . <end>
<start> Ab eis Caesar haec facta cognovit , qui sermoni interfuerunt ; conatus tamen nihilo minus est allis rationibus per colloquia de pace agere . <end>$$<start> He attempted , however , by other means to bring about a negotiation of peace . <end>
<start> Inter bina castra Pompei atque Caesaris unum flumen tantum intererat Apsus , crebraque inter se colloquia milites habebant , neque ullum interim telum per pactiones loquentium traiciebatur . <end>$$<start> Between Pompey's and Caesar's camp there was only the river Apsus , and the soldiers frequently conversed with each other ; and by a private arrangement among themselves , no weapons were thrown during their conferences . <end>
<start> Mittit Publius Vatinium legatum ad ripam ipsam fluminis , qui ea , quae maxime ad pacem pertinere viderentur , ageret et crebro magna voce pronuntiaret , liceretne civibus ad cives de pace legatos mittere , quod etiam fugitivis ab saltu Pyrenaeo praedonibusque licuisset , praesertim eum id agerent , ne cives cum civibus armis decertarent ? Multa suppliciter locutus est , ut de sua atque omnium salute debebat , silentioque ab utrisque militibus auditus . <end>$$<start> Caesar sent Publius Vatinius , one of his lieutenants , to the bank of the river , to make such proposals as should appear most conducive to peace ; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice asking , Are citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat of peace ? a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the Pyrenean mountains , and to robbers , especially when by so doing they would prevent citizens from fighting against citizens . <end>
<start> Quo cum esset postero die ventum , magna utrimque multitudo convenit , magnaque erat exspectatio eius rei , atque omnium animi intenti esse ad pacem videbantur . <end>$$<start> When the deputies met the next day , a great multitude from both sides assembled , and the expectations of every person concerning this subject were raised very high , and their minds seemed to be eagerly disposed for peace . <end>
<start> Qua ex frequentia , Titus Labienus prodit , sed missa oratione de pace , loqui atque altercari cum Vatinio incipit . <end>$$<start> Titus Labienus walked forward from the crowd , and in submissive terms began to speak of peace , and to argue with Vatinius . <end>
<start> Quorum mediam orationem interrumpunt subito undique tela immissa ; quae ille obtectus armis militum vitavit ; vulnerantur tamen complures , in his Cornelius Balbus , Marcus Plotius , Lucius Tiburtius , centuriones militesque nonnulli . <end>$$<start> But their conversation was suddenly interrupted by darts thrown from all sides , from which Vatinius escaped by being protected by the arms of the soldiers . <end>
<start> Eisdem temporibus Marcus Caelius Rufus praetor causa debitorum suscepta initio magistratus tribunal suum iuxta Gaius Treboni , praetoris urbani , sellam collocavit et , si quis appellavisset de aestimatione et de solutionibus , quae per arbitrum fierent , ut Caesar praesens constituerat , fore auxilio pollicebatur . <end>$$<start> At the same time in Rome , Marcus Caelius Rufus , one of the praetors , having undertaken the cause of the debtors , on entering into his office , fixed his tribunal near the bench of Caius Trebonius , the city praetor , and promised if any person appealed to him in regard to the valuation and payment of debts made by arbitration , as appointed by Caesar when in Rome , that he would relieve them . <end>
<start> Sed fiebat aequitate decreti et humanitate Treboni , qui his temporibus clementer et moderate ius dicendum existimabat , ut reperiri non possent , a quibus initium appellandi nasceretur . <end>$$<start> But it happened , from the justice of Trebonius's decrees and his humanity (for he thought that in such dangerous times justice should be administered with moderation and compassion) , that not one could be found who would offer himself the first to lodge an appeal . <end>
<start> Nam fortasse inopiam excusare et calamitatem aut propriam suam aut temporum queri et difficultates auctionandi proponere etiam mediocris est animi ; integras vero tenere possessiones , qui se debere fateantur , cuius animi aut cuius impudentiae est ? Itaque , hoc qui postularet reperiebatur nemo . <end>$$<start> For to plead poverty , to complain of his own private calamities , or the general distresses of the times , or to assert the difficulty of setting the goods to sale , is the behavior of a man even of a moderate temper ; but to retain their possessions entire , and at the same time acknowledge themselves in debt , what sort of spirit , and what impudence would it not have argued! Therefore nobody was found so unreasonable as to make such demands . <end>
<start> Atque ipsis , ad quorum commodum pertinebat , durior inventus est Caelius Et ab hoc profectus initio , ne frustra ingressus turpem causam videretur , legem promulgavit , ut sexenni die sine usuris creditae pecuniae solvantur . <end>$$<start> But Caelius proved more severe to those very persons for whose advantage it had been designed ; and starting from this beginning , in order that he might not appear to have engaged in so dishonorable an affair without effecting something , he promulgated a law that all debts should be discharged in six equal payments , of six months each , without interest . <end>
<start> Cum resisteret Servilius consul reliquique magistratus , et minus opinione sua efficeret , ad hominum excitanda studia sublata priore lege duas promulgavit : unam , qua mercedes habitationum annuas conductoribus donavit , aliam tabularum novarum , impetuque multitudinis in Gaius Trebonium facto et nonnullis vulneratis eum de tribunali deturbavit . <end>$$<start> When Servilius , the consul , and the other magistrates opposed him , and he himself effected less than he expected , in order to raise the passions of the people , he dropped it , and promulgated two others ; one , by which he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the tenants , the other , an act of insolvency : upon which the mob made an assault on Caius Trebonius , and having wounded several persons , drove him from his tribunal . <end>
<start> De quibus rebus Servilius consul ad senatum rettulit , senatusque Caelium ab re publica removendum censuit . <end>$$<start> The consul Servilius informed the senate of his proceedings , who passed a decree that Caelius should be removed from the management of the republic . <end>
<start> Hoc decreto eum consul senatu prohibuit et contionari conantem de rostris deduxit . <end>$$<start> Upon this decree , the consul forbade him the senate ; and when he was attempting to harangue the people , turned him out of the rostrum . <end>
<start> Ille ignominia et dolore permotus palam se proficisci ad Caesarem simulavit ; clam nuntiis ad Milonem missis , qui Clodio interfecto eo nomine erat damnatus , atque eo in Italiam evocato , quod magnis muneribus datis gladiatoriac familiae reliquias habebat , sibi coniiunxit atque eum in Thurinum ad sollicitandos pastores praemisit . <end>$$<start> Stung with the ignominy and with resentment , he pretended in public that he would go to Caesar , but privately sent messengers to Milo , who had murdered Clodius , and had been condemned for it ; and having invited him into Italy , because he had engaged the remains of the gladiators to his interest , by making them ample presents , he joined him , and sent him to Thurinum to tamper with the shepherds . <end>
<start> Ipse cum Casilinum venisset , uno que tempore signa eius militaria atque arma Capuae essent comprensa et familia Neapoli visa , quae proditionem oppidi appararet , patefactis consiliis exclusus Capua et periculum veritus , quod conventus arma ceperat atque eum hostis loco habendum existimabat , consilio destitit atque eo itinere sese avertit . <end>$$<start> When he himself was on his road to Casilinum , at the same time that his military standards and arms were seized at Capua , his slaves seen at Naples , and the design of betraying the town discovered : his plots being revealed , and Capua shut against him , being apprehensive of danger , because the Roman citizens residing there had armed themselves , and thought he ought to be treated as an enemy to the state , he abandoned his first design , and changed his route . <end>
<start> Interim Milo dimissis circum municipia litteris , se ea , quae faceret , iussu atque imperio facere Pompei , quae mandata ad se per Vibullium delata essent , quos ex acre alieno laborare arbitrabatur , sollicitabat . <end>$$<start> Milo in the mean time dispatched letters to the free towns , purporting that he acted as he did by the orders and commands of Pompey , conveyed to him by Bibulus : and he endeavored to engage in his interest all persons whom he imagined were under difficulties by reason of their debts . <end>
<start> Apud quos cum proficere nihil posset , quibusdam solutis ergastulis Cosam in agro Thurino oppugnare coepit . <end>$$<start> But not being able to prevail with them , he set at liberty some slaves from the work-houses , and began to assault Cosa in the district of Thurinum . <end>
<start> Eo cum a Quintus Pedio praetore cum legione lapide ictus ex muro periit Et Caelius profectus , ut dictitabat , ad Caesarem pervenit Thurios Ubi cum quosdam eius municipii sollicitaret equitibusque Caesaris Gallis atque Hispanis , qui eo praesidii causa missi erant , pecuniam polliceretur , ab his est interfectus . <end>$$<start> There having received a blow of a stone thrown from the wall of the town which was commanded by Quintus Pedius with one legion , he died of it ; and Caelius having set out , as he pretended for Caesar , went to Thurii , where he was put to death as he was tampering with some of the freemen of the town , and was offering money to Caesar's Gallic and Spanish horse , which he had sent there to strengthen the garrison . <end>
<start> Ita magnarum initia rerum , quae occupatione magistratuum et temporum sollicitam Italiam habebant , celerem et facilem exitum habuerunt . <end>$$<start> And thus these mighty beginnings , which had embroiled Italy , and kept the magistrates employed , found a speedy and happy issue . <end>

<start> Hic repentino adventu naves onerarias quasdam nactus incendit et unam frumento onustam abduxit magnumque nostris terrorem iniecit et noctu militibus ac sagittariis in terram eitis praesidium equitum deiecit et adeo loci opportunitate profecit , uti ad Pompeium litteras mitteret , naves reliquas , si vellet , subduci et refici iubcret : sua classe auxilia sese Caesaris prohibiturum . <end>$$<start> By his sudden arrival , he fell in with some of our transports , and set them on fire , and carried off one laden with corn ; he struck great terror into our men , and having in the night landed a party of soldiers and archers , he beat our guard of horse from their station , and gained so much by the advantage of situation , that he dispatched letters to Pompey , and if he pleased he might order the rest of the ships to be hauled upon shore and repaired ; for that with his own fleet he could prevent Caesar from receiving his auxiliaries . <end>
<start> Erat eo tempore Antonius Brundisii ; is virtute militum confisus scaphas navium magnarum circiter LX cratibus pluteisque contexit eoque milites delectos imposuit atque eas in litore pluribus locis separatim disposuit navesque triremes duas , quas Brundisii faciendas curaverat , per causam exercendorum remigum ad fauces portus prodire iussit . <end>$$<start> Antonius was at this time at Brundusium , and relying on the valor of his troops , covered about sixty of the long-boats belonging to the men-of-war with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles , and put on board them select soldiers ; and disposed them separately along the shore : and under the pretext of keeping the seamen in exercise , he ordered two three-banked galleys , which he had built at Brundusium , to row to the mouth of the port . <end>
<start> Has cum audacius progressas Libo vidisset , sperans intercipi posse , quadriremes V ad eas misit . <end>$$<start> When Libo saw them advancing boldly toward him , he sent five four-banked galleys against them , in hopes of intercepting them . <end>
<start> Quae cum navibus nostris appropinquassent , nostri veterani in portum refugiebant : illi studio incitati incautius sequebantur . <end>$$<start> When these came near our ships , our veteran soldiers retreated within the harbor . <end>
<start> Iam ex omnibus partibus subito Antonianae scaphae signo dato se in hostes incitaverunt primoque impeto unam ex his quadriremibus cum remigibus defensoribusque suis ceperunt , reliquas turpiter refugere coegerunt . <end>$$<start> The enemy , urged by their eagerness to capture them , pursued them unguardedly : for instantly the boats of Antonius , on a certain signal , rowed with great violence from all parts against the enemy ; and at the first charge took one of the four-banked galleys , with the seamen and marines , and forced the rest to flee disgracefully . <end>
<start> Ad hoc detrimentum accessit , ut equitibus per oram maritimam ab Antonio dispositis aquari prohiberentur . <end>$$<start> In addition to this loss , they were prevented from getting water by the horse which Antonius had disposed along the sea-coast . <end>
<start> Qua necessitate et ignominia permotus Libo discessit a Brundisio obsessionemque nostrorum omisit . <end>$$<start> Libo , vexed at the distress and disgrace , departed from Brundusium , and abandoned the blockade . <end>
<start> Multi iam menses erant et hiems praecipitaverat , neque Brundisio naves legionesque ad Caesarem veniebant Ac nonnullae eius rei praetermissae occasiones Caesari videbantur , quod certi saepe flaverant venti , quibus necessario committendum existimabat . <end>$$<start> Several months had now elapsed , and winter was almost gone , and Caesar's legions and shipping were not coming to him from Brundusium , and he imagined that some opportunities had been neglected , for the winds had at least been often favorable , and he thought that he must trust to them at last . <end>
<start> Quantoque eius amplius processerat temporis , tanto erant alacriores ad custodias , qui classibus praeerant , maioremque fiduciam prohibendi habebant , et crebris Pompei litteris castigabantur , quoniam primo venientem Caesarem non prohibuissent , ut reliquos eius exercitus impedirent , duriusque cotidie tempus ad transportandum lenioribus ventis exspectabant . <end>$$<start> And the longer it was deferred , the more eager were those who commanded Pompey's fleet to guard the coast , and were more confident of preventing our getting assistance : they received frequent reproofs from Pompey by letter , that as they had not prevented Caesar's arrival at the first , they should at least stop the remainder of his army : and they were expecting that the season for transporting troops , would become more unfavorable every day , as the winds grew calmer . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus permotus Caesar Brundisium ad suos severius scripsit , nacti idoneum ventum ne occasionem navigandi dimitterent , sive ad litora Apolloniatium sive ad Labeatium cursum dirigere atque eo naves eicere possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar , feeling some trouble on this account , wrote in severe terms to his officers at Brundusium , and gave them orders that as soon as they found the wind to answer , they should not let the opportunity of setting sail pass by , if they were even to steer their course to the shore of Apollonia : because there they might run their ships on ground . <end>
<start> Haec a custodiis classium loca maxime vacabant , quod se longius a portibus committere non audebant . <end>$$<start> That these parts principally were left unguarded by the enemy's fleet , because they dare not venture too far from the harbor . <end>
<start> Illi adhibita audacia et virtute administrantibus Marcus Antonio et Fufio Caleno , multum ipsis militibus hortantibus neque ullum periculum pro salute Caesaris recusantibus nacti austrum naves solvunt atque altero die Apolloniam praetervehuntur Qui cum essent ex continenti visi , Coponius , qui Dyrrachii classi Rhodiae praeerat , naves ex portu educit , et cum iam nostris remissiore vento appropinquasset , idem auster increbuit nostrisque praesidio fuit . <end>$$<start> They his officers , exerting boldness and courage , aided by the instructions of Marcus Antonius , and Fusius Kalenus , and animated by the soldiers strongly encouraging them , and declining no danger for Caesar's safety , having got a southerly wind , weighed anchor , and the next day were carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium , and being seen from the continent , Quintus Coponius , who commanded the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium , put out of the port with his ships ; and when they had almost come up with us , in consequence of the breeze dying away , the south wind sprang up afresh , and rescued us . <end>
<start> Neque vero ille ob eam causam conatu desistebat , sed labore et perseverantia nautarum etiam vim tempestatis superari posse sperabat praetervectosque Dyrrachium magna vi venti nihilo secius sequebatur . <end>$$<start> However , he did not desist from his attempt , but hoped by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able to bear up against the violence of the storm ; and although we were carried beyond Dyrrachium , by the violence of the wind , he nevertheless continued to chase us . <end>
<start> Nostri usi fortunae beneficio tamen impetum classis timebant , si forte ventus remisisset Nacti portum , qui appellatur Nymphaeum , ultra Lissum milia passuum III , eo naves introduxerunt (qui portus ab Africo tegebatur , ab austro non erat tutus) leviusque tempestatis quam classis periculum aestimaverunt . <end>$$<start> Our men , taking advantage of fortune's kindness , for they were still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet , if the wind abated , having come near a port , called Nymphaeum , about three miles beyond Lissus , put into it (this port is protected from a south-west wind , but is not secure against a south wind) ; and thought less danger was to be apprehended from the storm than from the enemy . <end>
<start> Quo simulatque introitum est , incredibili felicitate auster , qui per biduum flaverat , in Africum se vertit . <end>$$<start> But as soon as they were within the port , the south wind , which had blown for two days , by extraordinary good luck veered round to the south-west . <end>
<start> Hic subitam commutationem fortunae videre licuit . <end>$$<start> Here one might observe the sudden turns of fortune . <end>
<start> Qui modo sibi timuerant , hos tutissimus portus recipiebat ; qui nostris navibus periculum intulerant , de suo timere cogebantur Itaque tempore commutato tempestas et nostros texit et naves Rhodias afflixit , ita ut ad unam omnes , constratae numero XVI , eliderentur et naufragio interirent , et ex magno remigum propugnatorumque numero pars ad scopulos allisa interficeretur , pars ab nostris detraheretur ; quos omnes conservatos Caesar domum dimisit . <end>$$<start> We who , a moment before , were alarmed for ourselves , were safely lodged in a very secure harbor : and they who had threatened ruin to our fleet , were forced to be uneasy on their own account : and thus , by a change of circumstances , the storm protected our ships , and damaged the Rhodian fleet to such a degree that all their decked ships , sixteen in number , foundered , without exception , and were wrecked : and of the prodigious number of seamen and soldiers , some lost their lives by being dashed against the rocks , others were taken by our men : but Caesar sent them all safe home . <end>
<start> Nostrae naves duae tardius cursu confecto in noctem coniectae , cum ignorarent , quem locum reliquae cepissent , contra Lissum in ancoris constiterunt . <end>$$<start> Two of our ships , that had not kept up with the rest , being overtaken by the night , and not knowing what port the rest had made to , came to an anchor opposite Lissus . <end>
<start> Has scaphis minoribusque navigiis compluribus immissis Otacilius Crassus , qui Lissi praeerat , expugnare parabat ; simul de deditione eorum agebat et incolumitatem deditis pollicebatur . <end>$$<start> Otacilius Crassus , who commanded Pompey's fleet , detached after them several barges and small craft , and attempted to take them . <end>
<start> Harum altera navis CCXX e legione tironum sustulerat , altera ex veterana paulo minus CC . <end>$$<start> At the same time , he treated with them about capitulating , and promised them their lives if they would surrender . <end>
<start> Hic cognosci licuit , quantum esset hominibus praesidii in animi firmitudine . <end>$$<start> One of them carried two hundred and twenty recruits , the other was manned with somewhat less than two hundred veterans . <end>
<start> Tirones enim multitudine navium perterriti et salo nauseaque confecti iureiurando accepto , nihil eis nocituros hostes , se Otacilio dediderunt ; qui omnes ad eum producti contra religionem iurisiurandi in eius conspectu crudelissime interficiuntur . <end>$$<start> Here it might be seen what security men derive from a resolute spirit For the recruits , frightened at the number of vessels , and fatigued with the rolling of the sea , and with sea-sickness , surrendered to Otacilius , after having first received his oath , that the enemy would not injure them ; but as soon as they were brought before him , contrary to the obligation of his oath , they were inhumanly put to death in his presence . <end>
<start> At veteranae legionis milites , item conflictati et tempestatis et sentinae vitiis , neque ex pristina virtute remittendum aliquid putaverunt , et tractandis condicionibus et simulatione deditionis extracto primo noctis tempore gubernatorem in terram navem eicere cogunt , ipsi idoneum locum nacti reliquam noctis partem ibi confecerunt et luce prima missis ad eos ab Otacilio equitibus , qui eam partem orae maritimae asservabant , circiter CCCC , quique eos armati ex praesidio secuti sunt , se defenderunt et nonnullis eorum interfectis incolumes se ad nostros receperunt . <end>$$<start> But the soldiers of the veteran legion , who had also struggled , not only with the inclemency of the weather , but by laboring at the pump , thought it their duty to remit nothing of their former valor : and having protracted the beginning of the night in settling the terms , under pretense of surrendering , they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground : and having got a convenient place on the shore , they spent the rest of the night there , and at day-break , when Otacilius had sent against them a party of the horse , who guarded that part of the coast , to the number of four hundred , beside some armed men , who had followed them from the garrison , they made a brave defense , and having killed some of them , retreated in safety to our army . <end>
<start> Quo facto conventus civium Romanorum , qui Lissum obtinebant , quod oppidum eis antea Caesar attribuerat muniendumque curaverat , Antonium recepit omnibusque rebus iuvit . <end>$$<start> After this action , the Roman citizens , who resided at Lissus , a town which Caesar had before assigned them , and had carefully fortified , received Antony into their town , and gave him every assistance . <end>
<start> Otacilius sibi timens ex oppido fugit et ad Pompeium pervenit . <end>$$<start> Otacilius , apprehensive for his own safety , escaped out of the town , and went to Pompey . <end>
<start> Eitis omnibus copiis Antonius , quarum erat summa veteranarum trium legionum uniusque tironum et equitum DCCC , plerasque naves in Italiam remittit ad reliquos milites equitesque transportandos , pontones , quod est genus navium Gallicarum , Lissi relinquit , hoc consilio , ut si forte Pompeius vacuam existimans Italiam eo traiecisset exercitum , quae opinio erat edita in vulgus , aliquam Caesar ad insequendum facultatem haberet , nuntiosque ad eum celeriter mittit , quibus regionibus exercitum euisset et quid militum transvexisset . <end>$$<start> All his forces , whose number amounted to three veteran legions , and one of recruits , and about eight hundred horse being landed , Antony sent most of his ships back to Italy , to transport the remainder of the soldiers and horse The pontons , which are a sort of Gallic ships , he left at Lissus with this object , that if Pompey , imagining Italy defenseless , should transport his army thither (and this notion was spread among the common people) , Caesar might have some means of pursuing him ; and he sent messengers to him with great dispatch , to inform him in what part of the country he had landed his army , and what number of troops he had brought over with him . <end>
<start> Cognitaque re diversa sibi ambo consilia capiunt : Caesar , ut quam primum se cum Antonio coniungeret ; Pompeius , ut venientibus in itinere se opponeret , si imprudentes ex insidiis , adoriri posset , eodemque die uterque eorum ex castris stativis a flumine Apso exercitum educunt : Pompeius clam et noctu , Caesar palam atque interdiu . <end>$$<start> Pompey's route being easy , because he was not obliged to cross the river , he advanced rapidly and by forced marches against Antonius , and being informed of his approach , chose a convenient situation , where he posted his forces ; and kept his men close within camp , and forbade fires to be kindled , that his arrival might be the more secret . <end>
<start> Haec ad Antonium statim per Graecos deferuntur . <end>$$<start> He dispatched messengers to Caesar , and confined himself in his camp for one day . <end>
<start> Cuius adventu cognito Pompeius , ne duobus circumcluderetur exercitibus , ex eo loco discedit omnibusque copiis ad Asparagium Dyrrachinorum pervenit atque ibi idoneo loco castra ponit . <end>$$<start> On learning his arrival , Pompey , to prevent his being hemmed in between two armies , quitted his position , and went with all his forces to Asparagium , in the territory of Dyrrachium , and there encamped in a convenient situation . <end>
<start> His temporibus Scipio detrimentis quibusdam circa montem Amanum acceptis imperatorem se appellaverat Quo facto civitatibus tyrannisque magnas imperaverat pecunias , item a publicanis suae provinciae debitam biennii pecuniam exegerat et ab eisdem insequentis anni mutuam praeceperat equitesque toti provinciae imperaverat . <end>$$<start> During these times , Scipio , though he had sustained some losses near mount Amanus , had assumed to himself the title of imperator , after which he demanded large sums of money from the states and princes . <end>
<start> Quibus coactis , finitimis hostibus Parthis post se relictis , qui paulo ante Marcus Crassum imperatorem interfecerant et Marcus Bibulum in obsidione habuerant , legiones equitesque ex Syria deduxerat . <end>$$<start> He had also exacted from the tax-gatherers , two years' rents that they owed ; and enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year , and demanded a supply of horse from the whole province . <end>
<start> Summamque in sollicitudinem ac timorem Parthici belli provincia cum venisset , ac nonnullae militum voces cum audirentur , sese , contra hostem si ducerentur , ituros , contra civem et consulem arma non laturos , deductis Pergamum atque in locupletissimas urbes in hiberna legionibus maximas largitiones fecit et confirmandorum militum causa diripiendas his civitates dedit . <end>$$<start> When they were collected , leaving behind him his neighboring enemies , the Parthians (who shortly before had killed Marcus Crassus , the imperator , and had kept Marcus Bibulus besieged) , he drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria ; and when he came into the province , which was under great anxiety and fear of the Parthian war , and heard some declarations of the soldiers , That they would march against an enemy , if he would lead them on ; but would never bear arms against a countryman and consul ; he drew off his legions to winter quarters to Pergamus , and the most wealthy cities , and made them rich presents : and in order to attach them more firmly to his interest , permitted them to plunder the cities . <end>
<start> Interim acerbissime imperatae pecuniae tota provincia exigebantur . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , the money which had been demanded from the province at large , was most vigorously exacted . <end>
<start> Multa praeterea generatim ad avaritiam excogitabantur . <end>$$<start> Besides , many new imposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice . <end>
<start> In capita singula servorum ac liberorum tributum imponebatur ; columnaria , ostiaria , frumentum , milites , arma , remiges , tormenta , vecturae imperabantur ; cuius modo rei nomen reperiri poterat , hoc satis esse ad cogendas pecunias videbatur . <end>$$<start> A tax of so much a head was laid on every slave and child Columns , doors , corn , soldiers , sailors , arms , engines , and carriages , were made subject to a duty . <end>
<start> Non solum urbibus , sed paene vicis castellisque singulis cum imperio praeficiebantur . <end>$$<start> Wherever a name could be found for any thing , it was deemed a sufficient reason for levying money on it . <end>
<start> Erat plena lictorum et imperiorum provincia , differta praefectis atque exactoribus : qui praeter imperatas pecunias suo etiam privato compendio serviebant ; dictitabant enim se domo patriaque expulsos omnibus necessariis egere rebus , ut honesta praescriptione rem turpissimam tegerent . <end>$$<start> To this was added the most exorbitant interest , as usually happens in times of war ; the whole sums being called in , on which occasion , they alleged that the delay of a single day was a donation . <end>
<start> Accedebant ad haec gravissimae usurae , quod in bello plerumque accidere consuevit universis imperatis pecuniis ; quibus in rebus prolationem diei donationem esse dicebant . <end>$$<start> Therefore , in those two years , the debt of the province was doubled : but notwithstanding , taxes were exacted , not only from the Roman citizens , but from every corporation and every state . <end>
<start> Itaque aes alienum provinciae eo biennio multiplicatum est . <end>$$<start> And they said that these were loans , exacted by the senate's decree . <end>
<start> Praeterea Ephesi a fano Dianae depositas antiquitus pecunias Scipio tolli iubebat . <end>$$<start> Moreover , Scipio ordered the money formerly lodged in the temple of Diana at Ephesus , to be taken out with the statues of that goddess , which remained there . <end>
<start> Certaque eius rei die constituta cum in fanum ventum esset adhibitis compluribus ordinis senatorii , quos advocaverat Scipio , litterae ei redduntur a Pompeio , mare transisse cum legionibus Caesarem : properaret ad se cum exercitu venire omniaque posthaberet . <end>$$<start> When Scipio came to the temple , letters were delivered to him from Pompey , in the presence of several senators , whom he had called upon to attend him ; informing him that Caesar had crossed the sea with his legions ; that Scipio should hasten to him with his army , and postpone all other business . <end>
<start> His litteris acceptis quos advocaverat dimittit ; ipse iter in Macedoniam parare incipit paucisque post diebus est profectus . <end>$$<start> As soon as he received the letter , he dismissed his attendants , and began to prepare for his journey to Macedonia ; and a few days after set out . <end>
<start> Haec res Ephesiae pecuniae salutem attulit . <end>$$<start> This circumstance saved the money at Ephesus . <end>
<start> Caesar Antonii exercitu coniuncto deducta Orico legione , quam tuendae orae maritimae causa posuerat , temptandas sibi provincias longiusque procedendum existimabat et , cum ad eum ex Thessalia Aetoliaque legati venissent , qui praesidio misso pollicerentur earum gentium civitates imperata facturas , Lucius Cassium Longinum cum legione tironum , quae appellabatur XXVII , atque equitibus CC in Thessaliam , Gaius Calvisium Sabinum cum cohortibus V paucisque equitibus in Aetoliam misit ; maxime eos , quod erant propinquae regiones , de re frumentaria ut providerent , hortatus est . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having effected a junction with Antonius's army , and having drawn his legion out of Oricum , which he had left there to guard the coast , thought he ought to sound the inclination of the provinces , and march further into the country ; and when embassadors came to him from Thessaly and Aetolia , to engage that the states in those countries would obey his orders , if he sent a garrison to protect them , he dispatched Lucius Cassius Longinus , with the twenty-seventh , a legion composed of young soldiers , and two hundred horse , to Thessaly : and Caius Calvisius Sabinus , with five cohorts , and a small party of horse , into Aetolia . <end>
<start> Gnaeus Domitium Calvinum cum legionibus duabus , XI et XII , et equitibus D in Macedoniam proficisci iussit ; cuius provinciae ab ea parte , quae libera appellabatur , Menedemus , princeps earum regionum , missus legatus omnium suorum excellens studium profitebatur . <end>$$<start> He recommended them to be especially careful to provide corn , because those regions were nearest to him He ordered Cneius Domitius Calvinus to march into Macedonia with two legions , the eleventh and twelfth , and five hundred horse ; from which province , Menedemus , the principal man of those regions , on that side which is called the Free , having come as embassador , assured him of the most devoted affection of all his subjects . <end>
<start> Ex his Calvisius primo adventu summa omnium Aetolorum receptus voluntate , praesidiis adversariorum Calydone et Naupacto eiectis , omni Aetolia potitus est . <end>$$<start> Of these Calvisius , on his first arrival in Aetolia , being very kindly received , dislodged the enemy's garrisons in Calydon and Naupactus , and made himself master of the whole country . <end>
<start> Eodemque tempore Domitius in Macedoniam venit ; et cum ad eum frequentes civitatum legationes convenire coepissent , nuntiatum est adesse Scipionem cum legionibus , magna opinione et fama omnium ; nam plerumque in novitate rem fama antecedit . <end>$$<start> At the same time , Domitius arrived in Macedonia : and when numerous embassies had begun to wait on him from many of the states , news was brought that Scipio was approaching with his legions , which occasioned various opinions and reports ; for in strange events , rumor generally goes before . <end>
<start> Hic nullo in loco Macedoniae moratus magno impetu tetendit ad Domitium et , cum ab eo milia passuum XX afuisset , subito se ad Cassium Longinum in Thessalasm convertit . <end>$$<start> Without making any delay in any part of Macedonia , he marched with great haste against Domitius ; and when he was come within about twenty miles of him , wheeled on a sudden toward Cassius Longinus in Thessaly . <end>
<start> Hoc adeo celeriter fecit , ut simul adesse et venire nuntiaretur , et quo iter expeditius faceret , Marcus Favonium ad flumen Aliacmonem , quod Macedoniam a Thessalia dividit , cum cohortibus VIII praesidio impedimentis legionum reliquit castellumque ibi muniri iussit . <end>$$<start> He effected this with such celerity , that news of his march and arrival came together ; for to render his march expeditious , he left the baggage of his legions behind him at the river Haliacmon , which divides Macedonia from Thessaly , under the care of Marcus Favonius , with a guard of eight cohorts , and ordered him to build a strong fort there . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore equitatus regis Cotyis ad castra Cassii advolavit , qui circum Thessaliam esse consuerat Tum timore perterritus Cassius cognito Scipionis adventu visisque equitibus , quos Scipionis esse arbitrabatur , ad montes se convertit , qui Thessaliam cingunt , atque ex his locis Ambraciam versus iter facere coepit . <end>$$<start> At the same time , Cotus's cavalry , which used to infest the neighborhood of Macedonia , flew to attack Cassius's camp , at which Cassius being alarmed , and having received information of Scipio's approach , and seen the horse , which he imagined to be Scipio's , he betook himself to the mountains that environ Thessaly , and thence began to make his route toward Ambracia . <end>
<start> At Scipionem properantem sequi litterae sunt consecutae a Marcus Favonio , Domitium cum legionibus adesse neque se praesidium , ubi constitutus esset , sine auxilio Scipionis tenere posse . <end>$$<start> But when Scipio was hastening to pursue him , dispatches overtook him from Favonius , that Domitius was marching against him with his legions , and that he could not maintain the garrison over which he was appointed , without Scipio's assistance . <end>
<start> Quibus litteris acceptis consilium Scipio iterque commutat ; Cassium sequi desistit , Favonio auxilium ferre contendit . <end>$$<start> On receipt of these dispatches , Scipio changed his designs and his route , desisted from his pursuit of Cassius , and hastened to relieve Favonius . <end>
<start> Itaque die ac nocte continuato itinere ad eum pervenit , tam opportuno tempore , ut simul Domitiani exercitus pulvis cerneretur , et primi antecursores Scipionis viderentur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , continuing his march day and night , he came to him so opportunely , that the dust raised by Domitius's army , and Scipio's advanced guard , were observed at the same instant . <end>
<start> Ita Cassio industria Domitii , Favonio Scipionis celeritas salutem attulit . <end>$$<start> Thus , the vigilance of Domitius saved Cassius , and the expedition of Scipio , Favonius . <end>
<start> Scipio biduum castris stativis moratus ad flumen , quod inter eum et Domitii castra fluebat , Aliacmonem , tertio die prima luce exercitum vado traducit et castris positis postero die mane copias ante frontem castrorum instruit . <end>$$<start> Scipio , having staid for two days in his camp , along the river Haliacmon , which ran between him and Domitius's camp , on the third day , at dawn , led his army across a ford , and having made a regular encampment the day following , drew up his forces in front of his camp . <end>
<start> Domitius tum quoque sibi dubitandum non putavit , quin productis legionibus proelio decertaret . <end>$$<start> Domitius thought he ought not to show any reluctance , but should draw out his forces and hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Sed cum esset inter bina castra campus circiter milium passuum II , Domitius castris Scipionis aciem suam subiecit ; ille a vallo non discedere perseveravit . <end>$$<start> But as there was a plain six miles in breadth between the two camps , he posted his army before Scipio's camp ; while the latter persevered in not quitting his intrenchment . <end>
<start> Ac tamen aegre retentis Domitianis militibus est factum , ne proelio contenderetur , et maxime , quod rivus difficilibus ripis subiectus castris Scipionis progressus nostrorum impediebat . <end>$$<start> However , Domitius with difficulty restrained his men , and prevented their beginning a battle ; the more so as a rivulet with steep banks , joining Scipio's camp , retarded the progress of our men . <end>
<start> Quorum studium alacritatemque pugnandi cum cognovisset Scipio , suspicatus fore , ut postero die aut invitus dimicare cogeretur aut magna cum infamia castris se contineret , qui magna exspectatione venisset , temere progressus turpem habuit exitum et noctu ne conclamatis quidem vasis flumen transit atque in eandem partem , ex qua venerat , redit ibique prope flumen edito natura loco castra posuit . <end>$$<start> When Scipio perceived the eagerness and alacrity of our troops to engage , suspecting that he should be obliged the next day , either to fight , against his inclination , or to incur great disgrace by keeping within his camp , though he had come with high expectation , yet by advancing rashly , made a shameful end ; and at night crossed the river , without even giving the signal for breaking up the camp , and returned to the ground from which he came , and there encamped near the river , on an elevated situation . <end>
<start> Paucis diebus interpositis noctu insidias equitum collocavit , quo in loco superioribus fere diebus nostri pabulari consueverant ; et cum cotidiana consuetudine Qu . <end>$$<start> After a few days , he placed a party of horse in ambush in the night , where our men had usually gone to forage for several days before . <end>
<start> Varus , praefectus equitum Domitii , venisset , subito illi ex insidiis consurrexerunt . <end>$$<start> And when Quintus Varus , commander of Domitius's horse , came there as usual , they suddenly rushed from their ambush . <end>
<start> Sed nostri fortiter impetum eorum tulerunt , celeriterque ad suos quisque ordines rediit , atque ultro universi in hostes impetum fecerunt ; ex his circiter LXXX interfectis , reliquis in fugam coniectis , duobus amissis in castra se receperunt . <end>$$<start> But our men bravely supported their charge , and returned quickly every man to his own rank , and in their turn , made a general charge on the enemy ; and having killed about eighty of them , and put the rest to flight , retreated to their camp with the loss of only two men . <end>
<start> His rebus gestis Domitius , sperans Scipionem ad pugnam elici posse , simulavit sese angustiis rei frumentarise adductum castra movere , vasisque militari more conclamatis progressus milia passuum III loco idoneo et occulto omnem exercitum equitatumque collocavit . <end>$$<start> After these transactions , Domitius , hoping to allure Scipio to a battle , pretended to be obliged to change his position through want of corn , and having given the signal for decamping , advanced about three miles , and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place , concealed from the enemy's view . <end>
<start> Qui cum essent progressi , primaeque turmae insidias intravissent , ex fremitu equorum illata suspicione ad suos se recipere coeperunt , quique hos sequebantur celerem eorum receptum conspicati restiterunt . <end>$$<start> Our men , perceiving that the enemy had discovered their plot , and thinking it in vain to wait for any more , having got two troops in their power , intercepted them . <end>
<start> Deductis orae maritimae praesidiis Caesar , ut supra demonstratum est , III cohortes Orici oppidi tuendi causa reliquit isdemque custodiam navium longarum tradidit , quas ex Italia traduxerat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , having drawn his garrisons out of the sea-ports , as before mentioned , left three cohorts at Oricum to protect the town , and committed to them the charge of his ships of war , which he had transported from Italy . <end>
<start> Huic officio oppidoque Acilius Caninus legatus praeerat Is naves nostras interiorem in portum post oppidum reduxit et ad terram deligavit faucibusque portus navem onerariam submersam obiecit et huic alteram coniunxit ; super quam turrim effectam ad ipsum introitum portus opposuit et militibus complevit tuendamque ad omnes repentinos casus tradidit . <end>$$<start> Acilius , as lieutenant-general , had the charge of this duty and the command of the town ; he drew the ships into the inner part of the harbor , behind the town , and fastened them to the shore , and sank a merchant-ship in the mouth of the harbor to block it up ; and near it he fixed another at anchor , on which he raised a turret , and faced it to the entrance of the port , and filled it with soldiers , and ordered them to keep guard against any sudden attack . <end>
<start> Quibus cognitis rebus Gnaeus Pompeius filius , qui classi Aegyptiae praeerat , ad Oricum venit submersamque navim remulco multisque contendens funibus adduxit atque alteram navem , quae erat ad custodiam ab Acilio posita , pluribus aggressus navibus , in quibus ad libram fecerat turres , ut ex superiore pugnans loco integrosque semper defatigatis submittens et reliquis partibus simul ex terra scalis et classe moenia oppidi temptans , uti adversariorum manus diduceret , labore et multitudine telorum nostros vicit , deiectisque defensoribus , qui omnes scaphis excepti refugerant , eam navem expugnavit , eodemque tempore ex altera parte molem tenuit naturalem obiectam , quae paene insulam oppidum effecerat , et IIII biremes subiectis scutulis impulsas vectibus in interiorem portum traduxit . <end>$$<start> Cneius , Pompey's son , who commanded the Egyptian fleet , having got intelligence of these things , came to Oricum , and weighed up the ship , that had been sunk , with a windlass , and by straining at it with several ropes , and attacked the other which had been placed by Acilius to watch the port with several ships , on which he had raised very high turrets , so that fighting as it were from an eminence , and sending fresh men constantly to relieve the fatigued , and at the same time attempting the town on all sides by land , with ladders and his fleet , in order to divide the force of his enemies , he overpowered our men by fatigue , and the immense number of darts , and took the ship , having beat off the men that were put on board to defend it , who , however , made their escape in small boats ; and at the , same time he seized a natural mole on the opposite side , which almost formed an island over against the town . <end>
<start> Ita ex utraque parte naves longas aggressus , quae erant deligatae ad terram atque inanes , IIII ex his abduxit , reliquas incendit . <end>$$<start> He carried over land , into the inner part of the harbor , four galleys , by putting rollers under them , and driving them on with levers . <end>
<start> Ipse Lissum profectus naves onerarias XXX a Marcus Antonio relictas intra portum aggressus omnes incendit ; Lissum expugnare conatus defendentibus civibus Romanis , qui eius conventus erant , militibusque , quos praesidii causa miserat Caesar , triduum moratus paucis in oppugnatione amissis re infecta inde discessit . <end>$$<start> He attempted to storm Lissus , but being delayed three days by the vigorous defense of the Roman citizens who belonged to that district , and of the soldiers which Caesar had sent to keep garrison there , and having lost a few men in the assault , he returned without effecting his object . <end>
<start> Caesar , postquam Pompeium ad Asparagium esse cognovit , eodem cum exercitu profectus expugnato in itinere oppido Parthinorum , in quo Pompeius praesidium habebat , tertio die ad Pompeium pervenit iuxtaque eum castra posuit et postridie eductis omnibus copiis acie instructa decernendi potestatem Pompeio fecit . <end>$$<start> As soon as Caesar heard that Pompey was at Asparagium , he set out for that place with his army , and having taken the capital of the Parthinians on his march , where there was a garrison of Pompey's , he reached Pompey in Macedonia , on the third day , and encamped beside him ; and the day following having drawn out all his forces before his camp , he offered Pompey battle . <end>
<start> Ubi illum suis locis se tenere animadvertit , reducto in castra exercitu aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit . <end>$$<start> But perceiving that he kept within his trenches , he led his army back to his camp , and thought of pursuing some other plan . <end>
<start> Itaque postero die omnibus copiis magno circuitu difficili angustoque itinere Dyrrachium profectus est sperans Pompeium aut Dyrrachium compelli aut ab eo intercludi posse , quod omnem commeatum totiusque belli apparatum eo contulisset ; ut accidit Pompeim enim primo ignorans eius consilium , quod diverso ab ea regione itinere profectum videbat , angustiis rei frumentariae compulsum discessisse existimabat ; postea per exploratores certior factus postero die castra movit , breviore itinere se occurrere ei posse sperans . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , the day following , he set out with all his forces by a long circuit , through a difficult and narrow road to Dyrrachium ; hoping , either that Pompey would be compelled to follow him to Dyrrachium , or that his communication with it might be cut off , because he had deposited there all his provisions and material of war . <end>
<start> Pompeim interclusus Dyrrachio , ubi propositum tenere non potuit , secundo usus consilio edito loco , qui appellatur Petra aditumque habet navibus mediocrem atque eas a quibusdam protegit ventis , castra communit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , being cut off from Dyrrachium , as he was unable to effect his purpose , took a new resolution , and intrenched himself strongly on a rising ground , which is called Petra , where ships of a small size can come in , and be sheltered from some winds . <end>
<start> Eo partem navium longarum convenire , frumentum commeatumque ab Asia atque omnibus regionibus , quas tenebat , comportari imperat . <end>$$<start> Here he ordered a part of his men of war to attend him , and corn and provisions to be brought from Asia , and from all the countries of which he kept possession . <end>
<start> Caesar longius bellum ductum iri existimans et de Italicis commeatibus desperans , quod tanta diligentia omni litora a Pompeianis tenebantur , classesque ipsius , quas hieme in Sicilia , Gallia , Italia fecerat , morabantur , in Epirum rei frumentariae causa Quintus Tillium et Lucius Canuleium legatum misit , quodque hae regiones aberant longius , locis certis horrea constituit vecturasque frumenti finitimis civitatibus descripsit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , imagining that the war would be protracted to too great a length , and despairing of his convoys from Italy , because all the coasts were guarded with great diligence by Pompey's adherents ; and because his own fleets , which he had built during the winter , in Sicily , Gaul , and Italy , were detained ; sent Lucius Canuleius into Epirus to procure corn ; and because these countries were too remote , he fixed granaries in certain places , and regulated the carriage of the corn for the neighboring states . <end>
<start> Item Lisso Parthinisque et omnibus castellis quod esset frumenti conquiri iussit . <end>$$<start> He likewise gave directions that search should be made for whatever corn was in Lissus , the country of the Parthini , and all the places of strength . <end>
<start> Id erat perexiguum cum ipsius agri natura , quod sunt loca aspera ac montuosa ac plerumque frumento utuntur importato , tum quod Pompeius haec providerat et superioribus diebus praedae loco Parthinos habuerat frumentumque omne conquisitum spoliatis effossisque eorum domibus per equites comportarat . <end>$$<start> The quantity was very small , both from the nature of the land (for the country is rough and mountainous , and the people commonly import what grain they use) ; and because Pompey had foreseen what would happen , and some days before had plundered the Parthini , and having ravaged and dug up their houses , carried off all the corn , which he collected by means of his horse . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar consilium capit ex loci natura . <end>$$<start> Caesar , on being informed of these transactions , pursued measures suggested by the nature of the country . <end>
<start> Erant enim circum castra Pompei permulti editi atque asperi colles . <end>$$<start> For round Pompey's camps there were several high and rough hills . <end>
<start> Hos primum praesidiis tenuit castellaque ibi communit . <end>$$<start> These he first of all occupied with guards , and raised strong forts on them . <end>
<start> Inde , ut loci cuiusque natura ferebat , ex castello in castellum perducta munitione circumvallare Pompeium instituit , haec spectans , quod angusta re frumentaria utebatur quodque Pompeius multitudine equitum valebat , quo minore periculo undique frumentum commeatumque exercitui supportare posset , simul , uti pabulatione Pompeium prohiberet equitatumque eius ad rem gerendam inutilem efficeret , tertio , ut auctoritatem qua ille maxime apud exteras nationes niti videbatur , minueret , cum fama per orbem terrarum percrebuisset , illum a Caesare obsideri neque audere proelio dimicare . <end>$$<start> Then drawing a fortification from one fort to another , as the nature of each position allowed , he began to draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey , with these views ; as he had but a small quantity of corn , and Pompey was strong in cavalry , that he might furnish his army with corn and other necessaries from all sides with less danger ; secondly , to prevent Pompey from foraging , and thereby render his horse ineffectual in the operations of the war ; and thirdly , to lessen his reputation , on which he saw he depended greatly , among foreign nations , when a report should have spread throughout the world that he was blockaded by Caesar , and dare not hazard a battle . <end>
<start> Pompeins neque a mari Dyrrachioque discedere volebat , quod omnem apparatum belli , tela , arma , tormenta ibi collocaverat frumentumque exercitui navibus supportabat , neque munitiones Caesaris prohibere poterat , nisi proelio decertare vellet ; quod eo tempore statuerat non esse faciendum . <end>$$<start> Neither was Pompey willing to leave the sea and Dyrrachium , because he had lodged his material there , his weapons , arms , and engines ; and supplied his army with corn from it by his ships ; nor was he able to put a stop to Caesar's works without hazarding a battle , which at that time he had determined not to do . <end>
<start> Relinquebatur , ut extremam rationem belli sequens quam plurimos colles occuparet et quam latissimas regiones praesidiis teneret Caesarisque copias , quam maxime posset , distineret ; idque accidit Castellis enim XXIIII effectis XV milia passuum circuitu amplexus hoc spatio pabulabatur ; multaque erant intra eum locum manu sata , quibus interim iumenta pasceret . <end>$$<start> Nothing was left but to adopt the last resource , namely , to possess himself of as many hills as he could , and cover as great an extent of country as possible with his troops , and divide Caesar's forces as much as possible ; and so it happened : for having raised twenty-four forts , and taken in a compass of fifteen miles , he got forage in this space , and within this circuit there were several fields lately sown , in which the cattle might feed in the mean time . <end>
<start> Atque ut nostri perpetua munitione providebant , ne quo loco erumperent Pompeiani ac nostros post tergum adorirentur , ita illi interiore spatio perpetuas munitiones efficiebant , ne quem locum nostri intrare atque ipsos a tergo circumvenire possent . <end>$$<start> And as our men , who had completed their works by drawing lines of communication from one fort to another , were afraid that Pompey's men would sally out from some part , and attack us in the rear ; so the enemy were making a continued fortification in a circuit within ours to prevent us from breaking in on any side , or surrounding them on the rear . <end>
<start> Sed illi operibus vincebant , quod et numero militum praestabant et interiore spatio minorem circuitum habebant . <end>$$<start> But they completed their works first ; both because they had a greater number of men , and because they had a smaller compass to inclose . <end>
<start> Quaecumque erant loca Caesari capienda , etsi prohibere Pompeius totis copiis et dimicare non constituerat , tamen suis locis sagittarios funditoresque mittebat , quorum magnum habebat numerum , multique ex nostris vulnerabantur , magnusque incesserat timor sagittarum , atque omnes fere milites aut ex coactis aut ex centonibus aut ex coriis tunicas aut tegimenta fecerant , quibus tela vitarent . <end>$$<start> When Caesar attempted to gain any place , though Pompey had resolved not to oppose him with his whole force , or to come to a general engagement , yet he detached to particular places slingers and archers , with which his army abounded , and several of our men were wounded , and filled with great dread of the arrows ; and almost all the soldiers made coats or coverings for themselves of hair cloths , tarpaulins , or raw hides to defend them against the weapons . <end>
<start> Dicitur eo tempore glorians apud suos Pompeius dixisse : non recusare se , quin nullius usus imperator existimaretur , si sine maximo detrimento legiones Caesaris sese recepissent inde , quo temere essent progressae . <end>$$<start> It is reported that Pompey said that day in triumph to his friends about him , That he would consent to be accounted a general of no experience , if Caesar's legions effected a retreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they had rashly advanced . <end>
<start> Caesar receptui suorum timens crates ad extremum tumulum contra hostem proferri et adversas locari , intra has mediocri latitudine fossam tectis militibus obduci iussit locumque in omnes partes quam maxime impediri . <end>$$<start> Caesar , being uneasy about the retreat of his soldiers , ordered hurdles to be carried to the further side of the hill , and to be placed opposite to the enemy , and behind them a trench of a moderate breadth to be sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles ; and the ground to be made as difficult as possible . <end>
<start> Ipse idoneis locis funditores instruxit , ut praesidio nostris se recipientibus essent . <end>$$<start> He himself disposed slingers in convenient places to cover our men in their retreat . <end>
<start> His rebus comparatis legionem reduci iussit Pompeiani hoc insolentius atque audacius nostros premere et instare coeperunt cratesque pro munitione obiectas propulerunt , ut fossas transcenderent . <end>$$<start> These things being completed , he ordered his legions to file off : Pompey's men insultingly and boldly pursued and chased us , leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in the front of our works , in order to pass over the trench . <end>
<start> Quod cum animadvertisset Caesar , veritus , ne non reducti , sed reiecti viderentur , maiusque detrimentum caperetur , a medio fere spatio suos per Antonium , qui ei legioni praeerat , cohortatus tuba signum dari atque in hostes impetum fieri iussit . <end>$$<start> Which as soon as Caesar perceived , being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat , but to be repulsed , and that greater loss might be sustained , when his men were almost half way down the hill , he encouraged them by Antonius , who commanded that legion , ordered the signal of battle to be sounded , and a charge to be made on the enemy . <end>
<start> Milites legionis VIIII subito conspirtati pila coniecerunt et ex inferiore loco adversus clivum incitati cursu praecipites Pompeianos egerunt et terga vertere coegerunt ; quibus ad recipiendum crates deiectae longuriique obiecti et institutae fossae magno impedimento fuerunt . <end>$$<start> The soldiers of the ninth legion suddenly closing their files , threw their javelins , and advancing impetuously from the low ground up the steep , drove Pompey's men precipitately before them , and obliged them to turn their backs ; but their retreat was greatly impeded by the hurdles that lay in a long line before them , and the palisadoes which were in their way , and the trenches that were sunk . <end>
<start> Nostri vero , qui satis habebant sine detrimento discedere , compluribus interfectis V omnino suorum amissis quietissime se receperunt pauloque citra eum locum allis comprehensis collibus munitiones perfecerunt . <end>$$<start> But our men being contented to retreat without injury , having killed several of the enemy , and lost but five of their own , very quietly retired , and having seized some other hills somewhat on this side of that place , completed their fortifications . <end>
<start> Erat nova et inusitata belli ratio cum tot castellorum numero tantoque spatio et tantis munitionibus et toto obsidionis genere , tum etiam reliquis rebus . <end>$$<start> This method of conducting a war was new and unusual , as well on account of the number of forts , the extent and greatness of the works , and the manner of attack and defense , as on account of other circumstances . <end>
<start> Nam quicumque alterum obsidere conati sunt , perculsos atque infirmos hostes adorti aut proelio superatos aut aliqua offensione permotos continuerunt , cum ipsi numero equitum militumque praestarent ; causa autem obsidionis haec fere esse consuevit , ut frumento hostes prohiberent . <end>$$<start> For all who have attempted to besiege any person , have attacked the enemy when they were frightened or weak , or after a defeat ; or have been kept in fear of some attack , when they themselves have had a superior force both of foot and horse . <end>
<start> At tum integras atque incolumes copias Caesar inferiore militum numero continebat , cum illi omnium rerum copia abundarent ; cotidie enim magnus undique navium numerus conveniebat , quae commeatum supportarent , neque ullus flare ventus poterat , quin aliqua ex parte secundum cursum haberent . <end>$$<start> Besides , the usual design of a siege is to cut off the enemy's supplies On the contrary , Caesar , with an inferior force , was inclosing troops sound and unhurt , and who had abundance of all things . <end>
<start> Recordabantur enim eadem se superiore anno in Hispania perpessos labore et patientia maximum bellum confecisse , meminerant ad Alesiam magnam se inopiam perpessos , multo etiam maiorem ad Avaricum , maximarum gentium victores discessisse . <end>$$<start> They recollected too that they had suffered an alarming scarcity at Alesia , and a much greater at Avaricum , and yet had returned victorious over mighty nations . <end>
<start> Non illi hordeum cum daretur , non legumina recusabant ; pecus vero cuius rei summa erat ex Epiro copia , magno in honore habebant . <end>$$<start> They refused neither barley nor pulse when offered them , and they held in great esteem cattle , of which they got great quantities from Epirus . <end>
<start> Est autem genus radicis inventum ab eis , qui fuerant vacui ab operibus , quod appellatur chara , quod admixtum lacte multum inopiam levabat . <end>$$<start> There was a sort of root called chara , discovered by the troops which served under Valerius . <end>
<start> Eius erat magna copia . <end>$$<start> They made it into a sort of bread . <end>
<start> Ex hoc effectos panes , cum in colloquiis Pompeiani famem nostris obiectarent , vulgo in eos iaciebant , ut spem eorum minuerent . <end>$$<start> They had great plenty of it ; loaves made of this , when Pompey's men upbraided ours with want , they frequently threw among them to damp their hopes . <end>
<start> Iamque frumenta maturescere incipiebant , atque ipsa spes inopiam sustentabat , quod celeriter se habituros copiam confidebant ; crebraeque voces militum in vigiliis colloquiisque audiebantur , prius se cortice ex arboribus victuros , quam Pompeium e manibus dimissuros . <end>$$<start> The corn was now beginning to ripen , and their hope supported their want , as they were confident of having abundance in a short time . <end>
<start> Libenter etiam ex perfugis cognoscebant equos eorum tolerari , reliqua vero iumenta interisse ; uti autem ipsos valetudine non bona , cum angustiis loci et odore taetro ex multitudine cadaverum et cotidianis laboribus insuetos operum , tum aquae summa inopia affectos . <end>$$<start> For Caesar had either turned the course of all the rivers and streams which ran to the sea , or had dammed them up with strong works . <end>
<start> Omnia enim flumina atque omnes rivos , qui ad mare pertinebant , Caesar aut averterat aut magnis operibus obstruxerat , atque ut erant loca montuosa et aspera , angustias vallium sublicis in terram demissis praesaepserat terramque aggesserat , ut aquam contineret . <end>$$<start> And as the country was mountainous , and the valleys narrow at the bottom , he inclosed them with piles sunk in the ground , and heaped up mold against them to keep in the water . <end>
<start> Itaque illi necessario loca sequi demissa ac palustria et puteos fodere cogebantur atque hunc laborem ad cotidiana opera addebant ; qui tamen fontes a quibusdam praesidiis aberant longius et celeriter aestibus exarescebant . <end>$$<start> And even these springs were at a considerable distance from some of their posts , and soon dried up with the heat . <end>
<start> In novo genere belli novae ab utrisque bellandi rationes reperiebantur . <end>$$<start> In this new kind of war , new methods of managing it were invented by both generals . <end>
<start> Interim certior factus Publius Sulla , quem discedens catris praefecerat Caesar , auxillo cohorti venit cum legionibus duabus ; cuius adventu facile sunt repulsi Pompeiani . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , Publius Sylla , whom Caesar at his departure had left governor of his camp , came up with two legions to assist the cohort ; upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily repulsed . <end>
<start> Neque vero conspectum aut impetum nostrorum tulerunt , primisque deiectis reliqui se verterunt et loco cesserunt . <end>$$<start> Nor did they stand the sight and charge of our men , and the foremost falling , the rest turned their backs and quitted the field . <end>
<start> Sed insequentes nostros , ne longius prosequerentur , Sulla revocavit At plerique existimant , si acrius insequi voluisset , bellum eo die potuisse finire . <end>$$<start> But Sylla called our men in from the pursuit , lest their ardor should carry them too far , but most people imagine that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit , the war might have been ended that day . <end>
<start> Cuius consilium reprehendendum non videtur Aliae enim sunt legati partes atque imperatoris : alter omnia agere ad praescriptum , alter libere ad summam rerum consulere debet . <end>$$<start> His conduct however does not appear to deserve censure ; for the duties of a lieutenant-general , and of a commander-in-chief , are very different ; the one is bound to act entirely according to his instructions , the other to regulate his conduct without control , as occasion requires . <end>
<start> Sulla a Caesare in castris relictus liberatis suis hoc fuit contentus neque proelio decertare voluit , quae res tamen fortasse aliquem reciperet casum , ne imperatorias sibi partes sumpsisse videretur . <end>$$<start> Sylla , being deputed by Caesar to take care of the camp , and having rescued his men , was satisfied with that , and did not desire to hazard a battle (although this circumstance might probably have had a successful issue) , that he might not be thought to have assumed the part of the general . <end>
<start> Nam ex iniquo progressi loco in summo constiterant ; si per declive sese reciperent , nostros ex superiore insequentes loco verebantur ; neque multum ad solis occasum temporis supererat ; spe enim conficiendi negotii prope in noctem rem duxerant . <end>$$<start> If they attempted to retire down the steep , they dreaded the pursuit of our men from the rising ground , and there was but a short time till sunset : for in hopes of completing the business , they had protracted the battle almost till night . <end>
<start> Ita necessario atque ex tempore capto consilio Pompeius tumulum quendam occupavit , qui tantum aberat a nostro castello , ut telum tormento missum adigi non posset . <end>$$<start> Taking therefore measures suited to their exigency , and to the shortness of the time , Pompey possessed himself of an eminence , at such a distance from our fort that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach him . <end>
<start> Hoc consedit loco atque eum communivit omnesque ibi copias continuit . <end>$$<start> Here he took up a position , and fortified it , and kept all his forces there . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore duobus praeterea locis pugnatum est : nam plura castella Pompeius pariter distinendae manus causa temptaverat , ne ex proximis praesidiis succurri posset . <end>$$<start> At the same time , there were engagements in two other places ; for Pompey had attacked several forts at once , in order to divide our forces ; that no relief might be sent from the neighboring posts . <end>
<start> Ita uno die VI proeliis factis , tribus ad Dyrrachium , tribus ad munitiones , cum horum omnium ratio haberetur , ad duorurn milium numero ex Pompeianis cecidisse reperiebamus , evocatos centurionesque complures (in eo fuit numero Valerius Flaccus , Lucius filius , eius , qui praetor Asiam obtinuerat) ; signaque sunt militaria sex relata . <end>$$<start> Thus six engagements having happened in one day , three at Dyrrachium , and three at the fortifications , when a computation was made of the number of slain , we found that about two thousand fell on Pompey's side , several of them volunteer veterans and centurions . <end>
<start> Et cum laboris sui periculique testimonium afferre vellent , milia sagittarum circiter XXX in castellum coniecta Caesari renumeraverunt , scutoque ad eum relato Scaevae centurionis inventa sunt in eo foramina CXX . <end>$$<start> In reward for this man's services , both to himself and the public , Caesar presented to him two hundred thousand pieces of copper money , and declared him promoted from the eighth to the first centurion . <end>
<start> Quem Caesar , ut erat de se meritus et de re publica , donatum milibus CC collaudatumque ab octavis ordinibus ad primipilum se traducere pronuntiavit (eius enim opera castellum magna ex parte conservatum esse constabat) cohortemque postea duplici stipendio , frumento , veste , cibariis militaribusque donis amplissime donavit . <end>$$<start> For it appeared that the fort had been in a great measure saved by his exertions ; and he afterward very amply rewarded the cohorts with double pay , corn , clothing , and other military honors . <end>
<start> Pompeius noctu magnis additis munitionibus reliquis diebus turres exstruxit , et in altitudinem pedum XV effectis operibus vineis eam partem castrorum obtexit , et quinque intermissis diebus alteram noctem subnubilam nactus obstructis omnibus castrorum portis et ad impediendum obicibus obiectis tertia inita vigilia silentio exercitum eduxit et se in antiquas munitiones recepit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , having made great additions to his works in the night , the following days built turrets , and having carried his works fifteen feet high , faced that part of his camp with mantelets ; and after an interval of five days , taking advantage of a second cloudy night , he barricaded all the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit , and about midnight , quietly marched off his army , and retreated to his old fortifications . <end>
<start> Omnibus deinceps diebus Caesar exercitum in aciem aequum in locum produxit , si Pompeius proelio decertare vellet , ut paene castris Pompei legiones subiceret ; tantumque a vallo eius prima acies aberat , uti ne telum tormento adigi posset . <end>$$<start> Aetolia , Acarnania , and Amphilochis , being reduced , as we have related , by Cassius Longinus , and Calvisius Sabinus , Caesar thought he ought to attempt the conquest of Achaia , and to advance further into the country . <end>
<start> Aetolia , Acarnania , Amphilochis per Cassium Longinum et Calvisium Sabinum , ut demonstravimus , receptis temptandam sibi Achaiam ac paulo longius progrediendum existimabat Caesar . <end>$$<start> Every day afterward , Caesar drew up his army on a level ground , and offered Pompey battle , and led his legions almost close to Pompey's camp ; and his front line was at no greater distance from the rampart than that no weapon from their engines could reach it . <end>
<start> Haec cum in Achaia atque apud Dyrrachium gererentur , Scipionemque in Macedoniam venisse constaret , non oblitus pristini instituti Caesar mittit ad eum Aulus Clodium , suum atque illius familiarem , quem ab illo traditum initio et commendatum in suorum necessariorum numero habere instituerat . <end>$$<start> While these things were going forward in Achaia and at Dyrrachium , and when it was certainly known that Scipio was arrived in Macedonia , Caesar , never losing sight of his first intention , sends Clodius to him , an intimate friend to both , whom Caesar , on the introduction and recommendation of Pompey , had admitted into the number of his acquaintance . <end>
<start> Huic dat litteras mandataque ad eum ; quorum haec erat summa : sese omnia de pace expertum nihil adhuc effecisse : hoc arbitrari vitio factum eorum , quos esse auctores eius rei voluisset , quod sua mandata perferre non opportuno tempore ad Pompeium vererentur . <end>$$<start> To this man he gave letters and instructions to Pompey , the substance of which was as follows : That he had made every effort toward peace , and imputed the ill success of those efforts to the fault of those whom he had employed to conduct those negotiations ; because they were afraid to carry his proposals to Pompey at an improper time . <end>
<start> Scipionem ea esse auctoritate , ut non solum libere quae probasset exponere , sed etiam ex magna parte compellere atque errantem regere posset ; praeesse autem suo nomine exercitui , ut praeter auctoritatem vires quoque ad coercendum haberet . <end>$$<start> That Scipio had such authority , that he could not only freely explain what conduct met his approbation , but even in some degree enforce his advice , and govern him Pompey if he persisted in error ; that he commanded an army independent of Pompey , so that besides his authority , he had strength to compel ; and if he did so , all men would be indebted to him for the quiet of Italy , the peace of the provinces , and the preservation of the empire . <end>
<start> Quod si fecisset , quietem Italiae , pacem provinciarum , salutem imperii uni omnes acceptam relaturos Haec ad eum mandata Clodius refert ac primis diebus , ut videbatur , libenter auditus reliquis ad colloquium non admittitur , castigato Scipione a Favonio , ut postea confecto bello reperiebamus , infectaque re sese ad Caeaarem recepit . <end>$$<start> These proposals Clodius made to him , and for some days at the first appeared to have met with a favorable reception , but afterward was not admitted to an audience ; for Scipio being reprimanded by Favonius , as we found afterward when the war was ended , and the negotiation having miscarried , Clodius returned to Caesar . <end>
<start> Caesar , quo facilius equitatum Pompeianum ad Dyrrachium contineret et pabulatione prohiberet , aditus duos , quos esse angustos demonstravimus , magnis operibus praemunivit castellaque his locis posuit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , that he might the more easily keep Pompey's horse inclosed within Dyrrachium , and prevent them from foraging , fortified the two narrow passes already mentioned with strong works , and erected forts at them . <end>
<start> Pompeius , ubi nihil profici equitatu cognovit , paucis intermissis diebus rursus eum navibus ad se intra munitiones recipit . <end>$$<start> Pompey perceiving that he derived no advantage from his cavalry , after a few days had them conveyed back to his camp by sea . <end>
<start> Erat summa inopia pabuli , adeo ut foliis ex arboribus strictis et teneris harundinum radicibus contusis equos alerent (frumenta enim , quae fuerant intra munitiones sata , consumpserant) ; cogebantur Corcyra atque Acarnania longo interiecto navigationis spatio pabulum supportare , quodque erat eius rei minor copia , hordeo adaugere atque his rationibus equitatum tolerare . <end>$$<start> Fodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed his horses upon leaves stripped off the trees , or the tender roots of reeds pounded For the corn which had been sown within the lines was already consumed , and they would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder from Corcyra and Acarnania , over a long tract of sea ; and as the quantity of that fell short , to increase it by mixing barley with it , and by these methods support their cavalry . <end>
<start> Sed postquam non modo hordeum pabulumque omnibus locis herbaeque desectae , sed etiam frons ex arboribus deficiebat , corruptis equis macie conandum sibi aliquid Pompeius de eruptione existimavit . <end>$$<start> But when not only the barley and fodder in these parts were consumed , and the herbs cut away , when the leaves too were not to be found on the trees , the horses being almost starved , Pompey thought he ought to make some attempt by a sally . <end>
<start> Erant apud Caesarem in equitum numero Allobroges duo fratres , Raucillus et Egus , Adbucilli filii , qui principatum in civitate multis annis obtinuerat , singulari virtute homines , quorum opera Caesar omnibus Gallicis bellis optima fortissimaque erat usus . <end>$$<start> In the number of Caesar's cavalry were two Allobrogians , brothers , named Roscillus and Aegus , the sons of Abducillus , who for several years possessed the chief power in his own state ; men of singular valor , whose gallant services Caesar had found very useful in all his wars in Gaul . <end>
<start> His domi ob has causas amplissimos magistratus mandaverat atque eos extra ordinem in senatum legendos curaverat agrosque in Gallia ex hostibus captos praemiaque rei pecuniariae magna tribuerat locupletesque ex egentibus fecerat . <end>$$<start> To them , for these reasons , he had committed the offices of greatest honor in their own country , and took care to have them chosen into the senate at an unusual age , and had bestowed on them lands taken from the enemy , and large pecuniary rewards , and from being needy had made them affluent . <end>
<start> Hi propter virtutem non solum apud Caesarem in honore erant , sed etiam apud exercitum cari habebantur ; sed freti amicitia Caesaris et stulta ac barbara arrogantia elati despiciebant suos stipendiumque equitum fraudabant et praedam omnem domum avertebant . <end>$$<start> Their valor had not only procured them Caesar's esteem , but they were beloved by the whole army But presuming on Caesar's friendship , and elated with the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous people , they despised their countrymen , defrauded their cavalry of their pay , and applied all the plunder to their own use . <end>
<start> Quibus illi rebus permoti universi Caesarem adierunt palamque de eorum iniuriis sunt questi et ad cetera addiderunt falsum ab his equitum numerum deferri , quorum stipendium averterent . <end>$$<start> Displeased at this conduct , their soldiers went in a body to Caesar , and openly complained of their ill usage ; and to their other charges added , that false musters were given in to Caesar , and the surcharged pay applied to their own use . <end>
<start> Caesar neque tempus illud animadversionis esse existimans et multa virtuti corum concedens rem totam distulit ; illos secreto castigavit , quod quaestui equites haberent , monuitque , ut ex sua amicitia omnia exspectarent et ex praeteritis suis officiis reliqua sperarent . <end>$$<start> Caesar , not thinking it a proper time to call them to account , and willing to pardon many faults , on account of their valor , deferred the whole matter , and gave them a private rebuke , for having made a traffic of their troops , and advised them to expect every thing from his friendship , and by his past favors to measure their future hopes . <end>
<start> Magnam tamen haec res illis offensionem et contemptionem ad omnes attulit , idque ita esse cum ex aliorum obiectationibus tum etiam ex domestico iudicio atque animi conscientia intellegebant . <end>$$<start> Of this they became sensible , as well from the reproaches of others , as from the judgment of their own minds , and a consciousness of guilt . <end>
<start> Quos Pompeius , quod erant honesto loco nati et instructi liberaliter magnoque comitatu et multis iumentis venerant virique fortes habebantur et in honore apud Caesarem fuerant , quodque novum et praeter consuetudinem acciderat , omnia sua praesidia circumduxit atque ostentavit Nam ante id tempus nemo aut miles aut eques a Caesare ad Pompeium transierat , cum paene cotidie a Pompeio ad Caesarem perfugerent , vulgo vero universi in Epiro atque Aetolia conscripti milites earumque regionum omnium , quae a Caesare tenebantur . <end>$$<start> As they were persons nobly descended and of liberal education , and had come with a great retinue , and several cattle , and were reckoned men of courage , and had been in great esteem with Caesar , and as it was a new and uncommon event , Pompey carried them round all his works , and made an ostentatious show of them , for till that day , not a soldier , either horse or foot had deserted from Caesar to Pompey , though there were desertions almost every day from Pompey to Caesar : but more commonly among the soldiers levied in Epirus and Aetolia , and in those countries , which were in Caesar's possession . <end>
<start> Sed hi cognitis omnibus rebus , seu quid in munitionibus perfectum non erat , seu quid a peritioribus rei militaris desiderari videbatur , temporibusque rerum et spatiis locorum , custodiarum varia diligentia animadversa , prout cuiusque eorum , qui negotiis praeerant , aut natura aut studium ferebat , haec ad Pompeium omnia detulerunt . <end>$$<start> But the brothers , having been acquainted with all things , either what was incomplete in our works , or what appeared to the best judges of military matters to be deficient , the particular times , the distance of places , and the various attention of the guards , according to the different temper and character of the officer who commanded the different posts , gave an exact account of all to Pompey . <end>
<start> Quibus ille cognitis rebus eruptionisque iam ante capto consilio , ut demonstratum est , tegimenta galeis milites ex viminibus facere atque aggerem iubet comportare . <end>$$<start> Upon receiving this intelligence , Pompey , who had already formed the design of attempting a sally , as before mentioned , ordered the soldiers to make ozier coverings for their helmets , and to provide fascines . <end>
<start> Eodem naves , quas demonstravimus , aggere et levis armaturae militibus completas , quasque ad Dyrrachium naves longas habebat , mittit et , quid a quoque fieri velit , praecipit Ad eas munitiones Caesar Lentulum Marcellinum quaestorem cum legione VIIII positum habebat . <end>$$<start> These things being prepared , he embarked on board small boats and row galleys by night , a considerable number of light infantry and archers , with all their fascines , and immediately after midnight , he marched sixty cohorts drafted from the greater camp and the outposts , to that part of our works which extended toward the sea , and were at the furthest distance from Caesar's greater camp . <end>
<start> Erat eo loco fossa pedum XV et vallum contra hostem in altitudinem pedum X , tantundemque eius valli agger in latitudinem patebat : ab eo intermisso spatio pedum DC alter conversus in contrariam partem erat vallus humiliore paulo munitione . <end>$$<start> At this place , fronting the enemy , there was a ditch fifteen feet wide , and a rampart ten feet high , and the top of the rampart was ten feet in breadth . <end>
<start> Hoc enim superioribus diebus timens Caesar , ne navibus nostri circumvenirentur , duplicem eo loco fecerat vallum , ut , si ancipiti proelio dimicaretur , posset resisti . <end>$$<start> At an interval of six hundred feet from that there was another rampart turned the contrary way , with the works lower . <end>
<start> Sed operum magnitudo et continens omnium dierum labor , quod milium passuum in circuitu XVII munitiones erat complexus , perficiendi spatium non dabat . <end>$$<start> For some days before , Caesar , apprehending that our men might be surrounded by sea , had made a double rampart there , that if he should be attacked on both sides , he might have the means of defending himself . <end>
<start> Itaque contra mare transversum vallum , qui has duas munitiones coniungeret , nondum perfecerat . <end>$$<start> But the extent of the lines , and the incessant labor for so many days , because he had inclosed a circuit of seventeen miles with his works , did not allow time to finish them . <end>
<start> Quae res nota erat Pompeio delata per Allobrogas perfugas , magnumque nostris attulerat incommodum . <end>$$<start> Therefore the transverse rampart which should make a communication between the other two , was not yet completed . <end>
<start> Nam ut ad mare duo cohortes nonae legionis excubuerant , accessere subito prima luce Pompeiani ; simul navibus circumvecti milites in exteriorem vallum tela iaciebant , fossaeque aggere complebantur , et legionarii interioris munitionis defensores scalis admotis tormentis cuiusque generis telisque terrebant , magnaque multitudo sagittariorum ab utraque parte circumfundebatur . <end>$$<start> This circumstance was known to Pompey , being told to him by the Allobrogian deserters , and proved of great disadvantage to us For when our cohorts of the ninth legion were on guard by the sea-side , Pompey's army arrived suddenly by break of day , and their approach was a surprise to our men , and at the same time , the soldiers that came by sea , cast their darts on the front rampart ; and the ditches were filled with fascines : and the legionary soldiers terrified those that defended the inner rampart , by applying the scaling ladders , and by engines and weapons of all sorts , and a vast multitude of archers poured round upon them from every side . <end>
<start> Multum autem ab ictu lapidum , quod unum nostris erat telum , viminea tegimenta galeis imposita defendebant . <end>$$<start> Besides , the coverings of oziers , which they had laid over their helmets , were a great security to them against the blows of stones which were the only weapons that our soldiers had . <end>
<start> Itaque cum omnibus rebus nostri premerentur atque aegre resisterent animadversum est vitium munitionis , quod supra demonstratum est , atque inter duos vallos , qua perfectum opus non erat , Pompeiani navibus eiti in aversos nostros impetum fecerunt atque ex utraque munitione deiectos terga vertere coegerunt . <end>$$<start> And therefore , when our men were oppressed in every manner , and were scarcely able to make resistance , the defect in our works was observed , and Pompey's soldiers , landing between the two ramparts , where the work was unfinished , attacked our men in the rear , and having beat them from both sides of the fortification , obliged them to flee . <end>
<start> Hoc tumultu nuntiato Marcellinus cohortes subsidio nostris laborantibus submittit ex castris ; quae fugientes conspicatae neque illos suo adventu confirmare potuerunt neque ipsae hostium impetum tulerunt . <end>$$<start> Marcellinus , being informed of this disorder , detached some cohorts to the relief of our men , who seeing them flee from the camp , were neither able to persuade them to rally at their approach , nor themselves to sustain the enemy's charge . <end>
<start> Itaque quodcumque addebatur subsidii , id corruptum timore fugientium terrorem et periculum augebat ; hominum enim multitudine receptus impediebatur . <end>$$<start> And in like manner , whatever additional assistance was sent , was infected by the fears of the defeated , and increased the terror and danger . <end>
<start> In eo proelio cum gravi vulnere esset affectus aquilifer et a viribus deficeretur , conspicatus equites nostros , hanc ego , inquit , et vivus multos per annos magna diligentia defendi et nunc moriens eadem fide Caesari restituo . <end>$$<start> For retreat was prevented by the multitude of the fugitives In that battle , when the eagle-bearer was dangerously wounded , and began to grow weak , having got sight of our horse , he said to them , This eagle have I defended with the greatest care for many years , at the hazard of my life , and now in my last moments restore it to Caesar with the same fidelity . <end>
<start> Nolite , obsecro , committere , quod ante in exercitu Caesaris non accidit , ut rei militaris dedecus admittatur , incolumemque ad eum deferte . <end>$$<start> Do not , I conjure you , suffer a dishonor to be sustained in the field , which never before happened to Caesar's army , but deliver it safe into his hands . <end>
<start> Hoc casu aquila conservatur omnibus primae cohortis centurionibus interfectis praeter principem priorem . <end>$$<start> By this accident the eagle was preserved , but all the centurions of the first cohorts were killed , except the principal . <end>
<start> Iamque Pompeiani magna caede nostrorum castris Marcellini appropinquabant non mediocri terrore illato reliquis cohortibus , et Marcus Antonius , qui proximum locum praesidiorum tenebat , ea re nuntiata cum cohortibus XII descendens ex loco superiore cernebatur . <end>$$<start> And now the Pompeians , after great havoc of our troops , were approaching Marcellinus's camp , and had struck no small terror into the rest of the cohorts , when Marcus Antonius , who commanded the nearest fort , being informed of what had happened , was observed descending from the rising ground with twelve cohorts . <end>
<start> Cuius adventus Pompeianos compressit nostrosque firmavit , ut se ex maximo timore colligerent . <end>$$<start> His arrival checked the Pompeians , and encouraged our men to recover from their extreme affright . <end>
<start> Neque multo post Caesar significatione per castella fumo facta , ut erat superioris temporis consuetudo , deductis quibusdam cohortibus ex praesidiis eodem venit . <end>$$<start> And shortly after , Caesar having got notice by the smoke of all the forts , which was the usual signal on such occasions , drafted off some cohorts from the outposts , and went to the scene of action . <end>
<start> Qui cognito detrimento eum animadvertisset Pompeium extra munitiones egressum , castra secundum mare munire , ut libere pabulari posset nec minus aditum navibus haberet , commutata ratione belli , quoniam propositum non tenuerat , castra iuxta Pompeium munire iussit . <end>$$<start> And having there learned the loss he had sustained , and perceiving that Pompey had forced our works , and had encamped along the coast , so that he was at liberty to forage , and had a communication with his shipping , he altered his plan for conducting the war , as his design had not succeeded , and ordered a strong encampment to be made near Pompey . <end>
<start> Qua perfecta munitione animadversum est a speculatoribus Caesaris , cohortes quasdam , quod instar legionis videretur , esse post silvam et in vetera castra duci . <end>$$<start> When this work was finished , Caesar's scouts observed that some cohorts , which to them appeared like a legion , were retired behind the wood , and were on their march to the old camp . <end>
<start> Castrorum sic situs erat Superioribus diebus nona Caesaris legio , cum se obiecisset Pompeianis copiis atque opere , ut demonstravimus , circummuniret , castra eo loco posuit . <end>$$<start> The situation of the two camps was as follows : a few days before , when Caesar's ninth legion had opposed a party of Pompey's troops , and were endeavoring to inclose them , Caesar's troops formed a camp in that place . <end>
<start> Haec silvam quandam contingebant neque longius a mari passibus CCC aberant . <end>$$<start> This camp joined a certain wood , and was not above four hundred paces distant from the sea . <end>
<start> Post mutato consilio quibusdam de causis Caesar paulo ultra eum locum castra transtulit , paucisque intermissis diebus eadem Pompeius occupaverat et , quod eo loco plures erat legiones habiturus , relicto interiore vallo maiorem adiecerat munitionem . <end>$$<start> Afterward , changing his design for certain reasons , Caesar removed his camp to a small distance beyond that place ; and after a few days , Pompey took possession of it , and added more extensive works , leaving the inner rampart standing , as he intended to keep several legions there . <end>
<start> Ita minora castra inclusa maioribus castelli atque arcis locum obtinebant . <end>$$<start> By this means , the lesser camp , included within the greater , answered the purpose of a fort and citadel . <end>
<start> Item ab angulo catrorum sinistro munitionem ad flumen perduxerat circiter passus CCCC , quo liberius a periculo milites aquarentur . <end>$$<start> He had also carried an intrenchment from the left angle of the camp to the river , about four hundred paces , that his soldiers might have more liberty and less danger in fetching water . <end>
<start> Sed is quoque mutato consilio quibusdam de causis , quas commemorari necesse non est , eo loco excesserat . <end>$$<start> But he too , changing his design for reasons not necessary to be mentioned , abandoned the place . <end>
<start> Ita complures dies inania manserant castra ; munitiones quidem omnes integrae erant . <end>$$<start> In this condition the camp remained for several days , the works being all entire . <end>
<start> Eo signa legionis illata speculatores Caesari renuntiarunt . <end>$$<start> Caesar's scouts brought him word that the standard of a legion was carried to this place . <end>
<start> Hoc idem visum ex superioribus quibusdam castellis confirmaverunt . <end>$$<start> That the same thing was seen he was assured by those in the higher forts . <end>
<start> Is locus aberat a novis Pompei castris circiter passus quingentos . <end>$$<start> This place was a half a mile distant from Pompey's new camp . <end>
<start> Hanc legionem sperans Caesar se opprimere posse et cupiens eius diei detrimentum sarcire , reliquit in opere cohortes duas , quae speciem munitionis praeberent ; ipse diverso itinere quam potuit occultissime reliquas cohortes , numero XXXIII , in quibus erat legio nona multis amissis centurionibus deminutoque militum numero , ad legionem Pompei castraque minora duplici acie eduxit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , hoping to surprise this legion , and anxious to repair the loss sustained that day , left two cohorts employed in the works to make an appearance of intrenching himself , and by a different route , as privately as he could , with his other cohorts amounting to thirty-three , among which was the ninth legion , which had lost so many centurions , and whose privates were greatly reduced in number , he marched in two lines against Pompey's legion and his lesser camp . <end>
<start> Neque eum prima opinio fefellit . <end>$$<start> Nor did this first opinion deceive him . <end>
<start> Nam et pervenit prius , quam Pompeius sentire posset , et tametsi erant munitiones castrorum magnae , tamen sinistro cornu , ubi erat ipse , celeriter aggressus Pompeianos ex vallo deturbavit . <end>$$<start> For he reached the place before Pompey could have notice of it ; and though the works were strong , yet having made the attack with the left wing which he commanded in person , he obliged the Pompeians to quit the rampart in disorder . <end>
<start> Erat obiectus portis ericius Hic paulisper est pugnatum , cum irrumpere nostri conarentur , illi castra defenderent , fortissime Tito Pulione , cuius opera proditum exercitum Gaius Antoni demonstravimus , eo loco propugnante . <end>$$<start> A barricade had been raised before the gates , at which a short contest was maintained , our men endeavoring to force their way in , and the enemy to defend the camp ; Titus Pulcio , by whose means we have related that Caius Antonius's army was betrayed , defending them with singular courage . <end>
<start> Sed tamen nostri virtute vicerunt excisoque ericio primo in maiora castra , post etiam in castellum , quod erat inclusum maioribus castris , irruperunt , quo pulsa legio sese receperat , et nonnullos ibi repugnantes interfecerunt . <end>$$<start> But the valor of our men prevailed , and having cut down the barricade , they first forced the greater camp , and after that the fort which was inclosed within it ; and as the legion on its repulse had retired to this , they slew several defending themselves there . <end>
<start> Sed fortuna , quae plurimum potest cum in reliquis rebus tum praecipue in bello , parvis momentis magnas rerum commutationes efficit ; ut tum accidit . <end>$$<start> But Fortune who exerts a powerful influence as well in other matters , as especially in war , effects great changes from trifling causes , as happened at this time . <end>
<start> Munitionem , quam pertinere a castris ad flumen supra demonstravimus , dextri Caesaris cornu cohortes ignorantia loci sunt secutae , cum portam quaererent castrorumque eam munitionem esse arbitrarentur . <end>$$<start> For the cohorts on Caesar's right wing , through ignorance of the place , followed the direction of that rampart which ran along from the camp to the river , while they were in search of a gate , and imagined that it belonged to the camp . <end>
<start> Quod cum esset animadversum coniunctam esse flumini , prorutis munitionibus defendente nullo transcenderunt , omnisque noster equitatus eas cohortes est secutus . <end>$$<start> But when they found that it led to the river , and that nobody opposed them , they immediately climbed over the rampart , and were followed by all our cavalry . <end>
<start> Interim Pompeius hac satis longa interiecta mora et re nuntiata V legiones ab opere deductas subsidio suis duxit , eodemque tempore equitatus eius nostris equitibus appropinquabat , et acies instructa a nostris , qui castra occupaverant , cernebatur , omniaque sunt subito mutata . <end>$$<start> In the mean time Pompey , by the great delay which this occasioned , being informed of what had happened , marched with the fifth legion , which he called away from their work to support his party ; and at the same time his cavalry were advancing up to ours , and an army in order of battle , was seen at a distance by our men who had taken possession of the camp , and the face of affairs was suddenly changed . <end>
<start> Legio Pompeiana celeris spe subsidii confirmata ab decumana porta resistere conabatur atque ultro in nostros impetum faciebat . <end>$$<start> Caesar's cavalry , who had mounted the rampart by a narrow breach , being apprehensive of their retreat , were the first to flee . <end>
<start> His tantis malis haec subsidia succurrebant , quo minus omnis deleretur exercitus , quod Pompeius insidias timens , credo , quod haec praeter spem acciderant eius , qui paulo ante ex castris fugientes suos conspexerat , munitionibus appropinquare aliquamdiu non audebat , equitesque eius angustis spatiis atque his ab Caesaris militibus occupatis ad insequendum tardabantur . <end>$$<start> In this calamity , the following favorable circumstance occurred to prevent the ruin of our whole army , viz , that Pompey suspecting an ambuscade (because , as I suppose , the success had far exceeded his hopes , as he had seen his men a moment before fleeing from the camp) , durst not for some time approach the fortification ; and that his horse were retarded from pursuing , because the passes and gates were in possession of Caesar's soldiers . <end>
<start> Duobus his unius diei proeliis Caesar desideravit milites DCCCCLX et notos equites Romanos Tuticanum Gallum , senatoris filium , Gaius Fleginatem Placentia , Aulus Granium Puteolis , Marcus Sacrativirum Capua , tribunos militum et centuriones XXXII ; sed horum omnium pars magna in fossis munitionibusque et fluminis ripis oppressa suorum in terrore ac fuga sine ullo vulnere interiit ; signaque sunt militaria amissa XXXII . <end>$$<start> In the two actions of this day , Caesar lost nine hundred and sixty rank and file , several Roman knights of distinction , Felginas Tuticanus Gallus , a senator's son ; Caius Felginas from Placentia ; Aulus Gravius from Puteoli ; Marcus Sacrativir from Capua ; and thirty-two military tribunes and centurions . <end>
<start> Hoc nomen obtinuit atque ita se postea salutari passus est , sed neque in litteris scribere est solitus , neque in fascibus insignia laureae praetulit . <end>$$<start> But neither in his letters to the senate , nor in the fasces , did he use the laurel as a mark of honor . <end>
<start> At Labienus , cum ab eo impetravisset , ut sibi captivos tradi iuberet , omnes productos ostentationis , ut videbatur , causa , quo maior perfugae fides haberetur , commilitones appellans et magna verborum contumelia interrogans , solerentne veterani milites fugere , in omnium conspectu interfecit . <end>$$<start> But Labienus , having obtained his consent that the prisoners should be delivered up to him , had them all brought out , as it appeared , to make a show of them , and that Pompey might place a greater confidence in him who was a deserter ; and calling them fellow soldiers , and asking them in the most insulting manner whether it was usual with veterans to flee , ordered them to be put to death in the sight of the whole army . <end>
<start> His rebus tantum fiduciae ac spiritus Pompeianis accessit , ut non de ratione belli cogitarent , sed vicisse iam viderentur . <end>$$<start> Pompey's party were so elated with confidence and spirit at this success , that they thought no more of the method of conducting the war , but thought that they were already conquerors . <end>
<start> Non illi paucitatem nostrorum militum , non iniquitatem loci atque angustias praeoccupatis castris et ancipitem terrorem intra extraque munitiones , non abscisum in duas partes exercitum , cum altera alteri auxilium ferre non posset , causae fuisse cogitabant . <end>$$<start> They did not consider that the smallness of our numbers , and the disadvantage of the place and the confined nature of the ground occasioned by their having first possessed themselves of the camp , and the double danger both from within and without the fortifications , and the separation of the army into two parts , so that the one could not give relief to the other , were the causes of our defeat . <end>
<start> Non ad haec addebant non concursu acri facto , non proelio dimicatum , sibique ipsos multitudine atque angustiis maius attulisse detrimentum , quam ab hoste accepissent . <end>$$<start> They did not consider , in addition , that the contest was not decided by a vigorous attack , nor a regular battle ; and that our men had suffered greater loss from their numbers and want of room , than they had sustained from the enemy . <end>
<start> Non denique communes belli casus recordabantur , quam parvulae saepe causae vel falsae suspicionis vel terroris repentini vel obiectae religionis magna detrimenta intulissent , quotiens vel ducis vitio vel culpa tribuni in exercitu esset offensum ; sed , proinde ac si virtute vicissent , neque ulla commutatio rerum posset accidere , per orbem terrarum fama ac litteris victoriam eius diei concelebrabant . <end>$$<start> In fine , they did not reflect on the common casualties of war ; how trifling causes , either from groundless suspicions , sudden affright , or religious scruples , have oftentimes been productive of considerable losses ; how often an army has been unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general , or the oversight of a tribune ; but as if they had proved victorious by their valor , and as if no change could ever take place , they published the success of the day throughout the world by reports and letters . <end>
<start> Caesar a superioribus consiliis depulsus omnem sibi commutandam belli rationem existimavit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , disappointed in his first intentions , resolved to change the whole plan of his operations . <end>
<start> Hac habita contione nonnullos signiferos ignominia notavit ac loco movit Exercitui quidem omni tantus incessit ex incommodo dolor tantumque studium infamiae sarciendae , ut nemo aut tribuni aut centurionis imperium desideraret , et sibi quisque etiam poenae loco graviores imponeret labores , simulque omnes arderent cupiditate pugnandi , cum superioris etiam ordinis nonnulli ratione permoti manendum eo loco et rem proelio committendam existimarent . <end>$$<start> Having concluded his speech , he disgraced some standard-bearers , and reduced them to the ranks ; for the whole army was seized with such grief at their loss and with such an ardent desire of repairing their disgrace , that not a man required the command of his tribune or centurion , but they imposed each on himself severer labors than usual as a punishment , and at the same time were so inflamed with eagerness to meet the enemy , that the officers of the first rank , sensibly affected at their entreaties , were of opinion that they ought to continue in their present posts , and commit their fate to the hazard of a battle . <end>
<start> Contra ea Caesar neque satis militibus perterritis confidebat spatiumque interponendum ad recreandos animos putabat , et relictis munitionibus magnopere rei frumentariae timebat . <end>$$<start> But , on the other hand , Caesar could not place sufficient confidence in men so lately thrown into consternation , and thought he ought to allow them time to recover their dejected spirits ; and having abandoned his works , he was apprehensive of being distressed for want of corn . <end>
<start> Itaque nulla interposita mora sauciorum modo et aegrorum habita ratione impedimenta omnia silentio prima nocte ex castris Apolloniam praemisit Haec conquiescere ante iter confectum vetuit . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , suffering no time to intervene but what was necessary for a proper attention to be paid to the sick and wounded , he sent on all his baggage privately in the beginning of the night from his camp to Apollonia , and ordered them not to halt till they had performed their journey ; and he detached one legion with them as a convoy . <end>
<start> His una legio missa praesidio est His explicitis rebus duas in castris legiones retinuit , reliquas de quarta vigilia compluribus portis eductas eodem itinere praemisit parvoque spatio intermisso , ut et militare institutum servaretur , et quam serissime eius profectio cognosceretur conclamari iussit statimque egressus et novissimum agmen consecutus celeriter ex conspectu castrorum discessit . <end>$$<start> This affair being concluded , having retained only two legions in his camp , he marched the rest of his army out at three o'clock in the morning by several gates , and sent them forward by the same route ; and in a short space after , that the military practice might be preserved , and his march known as late as possible , he ordered the signal for decamping to be given ; and setting out immediately and following the rear of his own army , he was soon out of sight of the camp . <end>
<start> Neque vero Pompeius cognito consilio eius moram ullam ad insequendum intulit ; sed eodem spectans , si itinere impeditos perterritos deprehendere posset , exercitum e castris eduxit equitatumque praemisit ad novissimum agmen demorandum , neque consequi potuit , quod multum expedito itinere antecesserat Caesar . <end>$$<start> Nor did Pompey , as soon as he had notice of his design , make any delay to pursue him ; but with a view to surprise them while encumbered with baggage on their march , and not yet recovered from their fright , he led his army out of his camp , and sent his cavalry on to retard our rear ; but was not able to come up with them , because Caesar had got far before him , and marched without baggage . <end>
<start> Sed cum ventum esset ad flumen Genusum , quod ripis erat impeditis , consecutus equitatus novissimos proelio detinebat . <end>$$<start> But when we reached the river Genusus , the banks being steep , their horse overtook our rear , and detained them by bringing them to action . <end>
<start> Huic suos Caesar equites opposuit expeditosque antesignanos admiscuit CCCC ; qui tantum profecerunt , ut equestri proelio commisso pellerent omnes compluresque interficerent ipsique incolumes se ad agmen reciperent . <end>$$<start> To oppose whom , Caesar sent his horse , and intermixed with them about four hundred of his advanced light troops , who attacked their horse with such success , that having routed them all , and killed several , they returned without any loss to the main body . <end>
<start> Confecto iusto itinere eius diei Caesar traductoque exercitu flumen Genusum veteribus suis in castris contra Asparagium consedit militesque omnes intra vallum continuit equitatumque per causam pabulandi emissum confestim decumana porta in castra se recipere iussit . <end>$$<start> Having performed the exact march which he had proposed that day , and having led his army over the river Genusus , Caesar posted himself in his old camp opposite Asparagium ; and kept his soldiers close within the intrenchments and ordered the horse , who had been sent out under pretense of foraging , to retire immediately into the camp , through the Decuman gate . <end>
<start> Simili ratione Pompeius confecto eius diei itinere in suis veteribus castris ad Asparagium consedit Eius milites , quod ab opere integris munitionibus vacabant , alii lignandi pabulandique causa longius progrediebantur , alii , quod subito consilium profectionis ceperant magna parte impedimentorum et sarcinarum relicta , ad haec repetenda invitati propinquitate superiorum castrorum , depositis in contubernio armis , vallum relinquebant . <end>$$<start> Pompey , in like manner , having completed the same day's march , took post in his old camp at Asparagium ; and his soldiers , as they had no work (the fortifications being entire) , made long excursions , some to collect wood and forage ; others , invited by the nearness of the former camp , laid up their arms in their tents , and quitted the intrenchments in order to bring what they had left behind them , because the design of marching being adopted in a hurry , they had left a considerable part of their wagons and luggage behind . <end>
<start> Quibus ad sequendum impeditis Caesar , quod fore providerat , meridiano fere tempore signo profectionis dato exercitum educit duplicatoque eius diei itinere VIII milia passuum ex eo loco procedit ; quod facere Pompeius discessu militum non potuit . <end>$$<start> Being thus incapable of pursuing , as Caesar had foreseen , about noon he gave the signal for marching , led out his army , and doubling that day's march , he advanced eight miles beyond Pompey's camp ; who could not pursue him , because his troops were dispersed . <end>
<start> Postero die Caesar similiter praemissis prima nocte impedimentis de quarta vigilia ipse egreditur , ut , si qua esset imposita dimicandi necessitas , subitum casum expedito exercitu subiret . <end>$$<start> The next day Caesar sent his baggage forward early in the night , and marched off himself immediately after the fourth watch : that if he should be under the necessity of risking an engagement , he might meet a sudden attack with an army free from incumbrance . <end>
<start> Hoc idem reliquis fecit diebus Quibus rebus perfectum est , ut altissimis fluminibus atque impeditissimis itineribus nullum acciperet incommodum . <end>$$<start> He did so for several days successively , by which means he was enabled to effect his march over the deepest rivers , and through the most intricate roads without any loss . <end>
<start> Pompeius primi diei mora illata et reliquorum dierum frustra labore suscepto , cum se magnis itineribus extenderet et praegressos consequi cuperet , quarto die finem sequendi fecit atque aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit . <end>$$<start> For Pompey , after the first day's delay , and the fatigue which he endured for some days in vain , though he exerted himself by forced marches , and was anxious to overtake us , who had got the start of him , on the fourth day desisted from the pursuit , and determined to follow other measures . <end>
<start> Caesari ad saucios deponendos , stipendium exercitui dandum , socios confirmandos , praesidium urbibus relinquendum necesse erat adire Apolloniam . <end>$$<start> Caesar was obliged to go to Apollonia , to lodge his wounded , pay his army , confirm his friends , and leave garrisons in the towns . <end>
<start> Sed his rebus tantum temporis tribuit , quantum erat properanti necesse ; timens Domitio , ne adventu Pompei praeoccuparetur , ad eum omni celeritate et studio incitatus ferebatur . <end>$$<start> But for these matters , he allowed no more time than was necessary for a person in haste . <end>
<start> Totius autem rei consilium his rationibus explicabat , ut , si Pompeius eodem contenderet , abductum ilium a mari atque ab eis copiis , quas Dyrrachii comparaverat , abstractum pari condicione belli secum decertare cogeret ; si in Italiam transiret , coniuncto exercitu cum Domitio per Illyricum Italiae subsidio proficisceretur ; si Apolloniam Oricumque oppugnare et se omni maritima ora excludere conaretur , obsesso Scipione necessario illum suis auxilium ferre cogeret . <end>$$<start> And being apprehensive for Domitius , lest he should be surprised by Pompey's arrival , he hastened with all speed and earnestness to join him ; for he planned the operations of the whole campaign on these principles : that if Pompey should march after him , he would be drawn off from the sea , and from those forces which he had provided in Dyrrachium , and separated from his corn and magazines , and be obliged to carry on the war on equal terms ; but if he crossed over into Italy , Caesar , having effected a junction with Domitius , would march through Illyricum to the relief of Italy ; but if he endeavored to storm Apollonia and Oricum , and exclude him from the whole coast , he hoped , by besieging Scipio , to oblige him , of necessity , to come to his assistance . <end>
<start> Itaque praemissis nuntiis ad Gnaeus Domitium Caesar ei scripsit et , quid fieri vellet , ostendit , praesidioque Apolloniae cohortibus IIII , Lissi I , III Orici relictis , quique erant ex vulneribus aegri depositis , per Epirum atque Athamaniam iter facere coepit . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , Caesar dispatching couriers , writes to Domitius , and acquaints him with his wishes on the subject : and having stationed a garrison of four cohorts at Apollonia , one at Lissus , and three at Oricum , besides those who were sick of their wounds , he set forward on his march through Epirus and Acarnania . <end>
<start> Pompeius quoque de Caesaris consilio coniectura iudicans ad Scipionem properandum sibi existimabat : si Caesar iter illo haberet , ut subsidium Scipioni ferret ; si ab ora maritima Oricoque discedere nollet , quod legiones equitatumque ex Italia exspectaret , ipse ut omnibus copiis Domitium aggrederetur . <end>$$<start> Pompey , also , guessing at Caesar's design , determined to hasten to Scipio , that if Caesar should march in that direction , he might be ready to relieve him ; but that if Caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and Corcyra , because he expected legions and cavalry from Italy , he himself might fall on Domitius with all his forces . <end>
<start> His de causis uterque eorum celeritati studebat , et suis ut esset auxilio , et ad opprimendos adversarios ne occasioni temporis deesset . <end>$$<start> For these reasons , each of them studied dispatch , that he might succor his friends , and not miss an opportunity of surprising his enemies . <end>
<start> Sed Caesarem Apollonia a directo itinere averterat ; Pompeius per Candaviam iter in Macedoniam expeditum habebat . <end>$$<start> But Caesar's engagements at Apollonia had carried him aside from the direct road . <end>
<start> Accessit etiam ex improviso aliud incommodum , quod Domitius , qui dies complures castris Scipionis castra collata habuisset , rei frumentariae causa ab eo discesserat et Heracliam , quae est subiecta Candaviae , iter fecerat , ut ipsa fortuna illum obicere Pompeio videretur . <end>$$<start> Pompey had taken the short road to Macedonia , through Candavia To this was added another unexpected disadvantage , that Domitius , who for several days had been encamped opposite Scipio , had quitted that post for the sake of provisions , and had marched to Heraclea Sentica , a city subject to Candavia ; so that fortune herself seemed to throw him in Pompey's way . <end>
<start> Haec ad id tempus Caesar ignorabat . <end>$$<start> Of this , Caesar was ignorant up to this time . <end>
<start> Simul a Pompeio litteris per omnes provincias civitatesque dimissis proelio ad Dyrrachium facto latius inflatiusque multo , quam res erat gesta , fama percrebuerat , pulsum fugere Caesarem paene omnibus copiis amissis ; haec itinera infesta reddiderat , haec civitates nonnullas ab eius amicitia avertebat . <end>$$<start> Letters likewise being sent by Pompey through all the provinces and states , with an account of the action at Dyrrachium , very much enlarged and exaggerated beyond the real facts , a rumor had been circulated , that Caesar had been defeated and forced to flee , and had lost almost all his forces . <end>
<start> Sed Allobroges , Raucilli atque Egi familiares , quos perfugisse ad Pompeium demonstravimus , conspicati in itinere exploratores Domitii , seu pristina sua consuetudine , quod una in Gallia bella gesserant , seu gloria elati cuncta , ut erant acta , euerunt et Caesaris profectionem et adventum Pompei docuerunt . <end>$$<start> But the Allobroges , who were in the retinue of Aegus and Roscillus , and who had deserted to Pompey , having met on the road a scouting party of Domitius ; either from old acquaintance , because they had served together in Gaul , or elated with vain glory , gave them an account of all that had happened , and informed them of Caesar's departure , and Pompey's arrival . <end>
<start> A quibus Domitius certior factus vix IIII horarum spatio antecedens hostium beneficio periculum vitavit et ad Aeginium , quod est oppidum obiectum Thessaliae , Caesari venienti occurrit . <end>$$<start> Domitius , who was scarce four hours' march distant , having got intelligence from these , by the courtesy of the enemy , avoided the danger , and met Caesar coming to join him at Aeginium , a town on the confines of and opposite to Thessaly . <end>
<start> Coniuncto exercitu Caesar Gomphos pervenit , quod est oppidum primum Thessaliae venientibus ab Epiro ; quae gens paucis ante mensibus ultro ad Caesarem legatos miserat , ut suis omnibus facultatibus uteretur , praesidiumque ab eo militum petierat . <end>$$<start> The two armies being united , Caesar marched to Gomphi , which is the first town of Thessaly on the road from Epirus Now , the Thessalians , a few months before , had of themselves sent embassadors to Caesar , offering him the free use of every thing in their power , and requesting a garrison for their protection . <end>
<start> Sed eo fama iam praecurrerat , quam supra docuimus , de proelio Dyrrachino , quod multis auxerat partibus . <end>$$<start> But the report , already spoken of , of the battle at Dyrrachium , which it had exaggerated in many particulars , had arrived before him . <end>
<start> Itaque Androsthenes , praetor Thessaliae , cum se victoriae Pompei comitem esse mallet quam socium Caesaris in rebus adversis , omnem ex agris multitudinem servorum ac liberorum in oppidum cogit portasque praecludit et ad Scipionem Pompeiumque nuntios mittit , ut sibi subsidio veniant : se confidere munitionibus oppidi , si celeriter succurratur ; longinquam oppugnationem sustinere non posse . <end>$$<start> In consequence of which , Androsthenes , the praetor of Thessaly , as he preferred to be the companion of Pompey's victory , rather than Caesar's associate in his misfortunes , collected all the people , both slaves and freemen from the country into the town and shut the gates , and dispatched messengers to Scipio and Pompey to come to his relief , that he could depend on the strength of the town , if succor was speedily sent ; but that it could not withstand a long siege . <end>
<start> Scipio discessu exercituum ab Dyrrachio cognito Larisam legiones adduxerat ; Pompeius nondum Thessaliae appropinquabat . <end>$$<start> Scipio , as soon as he received advice of the departure of the armies from Dyrrachium , had marched with his legions to Larissa : Pompey was not yet arrived near Thessaly . <end>
<start> Caesar castris munitis scalas musculosque ad repentinam oppugnationem fieri et crates parari iussit . <end>$$<start> Caesar having fortified his camp , ordered scaling-ladders and pent-houses to be made for a sudden assault , and hurdles to be provided . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus effectis cohortatus milites docuit , quantum usum haberet ad sublevandam omnium rerum inopiam potiri oppido pleno atque opulento , simul reliquis civitatibus huius urbis exemplo inferre terrorem et id fieri celeriter , priusquam auxilia concurrerent . <end>$$<start> As soon as they were ready , he exhorted his soldiers , and told them of what advantage it would be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries , if they made themselves masters of a rich and plentiful town : and , at the same time to strike terror into other states by the example of this , and to effect this with speed , before auxiliaries could arrive . <end>
<start> Itaque usus singulari militum studio eodem , quo venerat , die post horam nonam oppidum altissimis moenibus oppugnare aggressus ante solis oocasum expugnavit et ad diripiendum militibus concessit statimque ab oppido castra movit et Metropolim venit , sic ut nuntios expugnati oppidi famamque antecederet . <end>$$<start> Accordingly , taking advantage of the unusual ardor of the soldiers , he began his assault on the town at a little after three o'clock on the very day on which he arrived , and took it , though defended with very high walls , before sunset , and gave it up to his army to plunder , and immediately decamped from before it , and marched to Metropolis , with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumor of the taking of Gomphi . <end>
<start> Metropolitae primum eodem usi consilio isdem permoti rumoribus portas clauserunt murosque armatis compleverunt ; sed postea casu civitatis Gomphensis cognito ex captivis , quos Caesar ad murum producendos curaverat , portas aperuerunt . <end>$$<start> The inhabitants of Metropolis , at first influenced by the same rumors , followed the same measures , shut the gates and manned their walls . <end>
<start> Quibus diligentissime conservatis collata fortuna Metropolitum cum casu Gomphensium nulla Thessaliae fuit civitas praeter Larisaeos , qui magnis exercitibus Scipionis tenebantur , quin Caesari parerent atque imperata facerent . <end>$$<start> As he preserved them with the greatest care , there was not a state in Thessaly (except Larissa , which was awed by a strong army of Scipio's) , but on comparing the fate of the inhabitants of Metropolis with the severe treatment of Gomphi , gave admission to Caesar , and obeyed his orders . <end>
<start> Pompeius paucis post diebus in Thessaliam pervenit contionatusque apud cunctum exercitum suis agit gratias , Scipionis milites cohortatur , ut parta iam victoria praedae ac praemiorum velint esse participes , receptisque omnibus in una castra legionibus suum cum Scipione honorem partitur classicumque apud eum cani et alterum illi iubet praetorium tendi . <end>$$<start> Pompey arrived in Thessaly a few days after , and having harangued the combined army , returned thanks to his own men , and exhorted Scipio's soldiers , that as the victory was now secured , they should endeavor to merit a part of the rewards and booty . <end>
<start> Auctis copiis Pompei duobusque magnis exercitibus coniunctis pristina omnium confirmatur opinio , et spes victoriae augetur , adeo ut , quicquid intercederet temporis , id morari reditum in Italiam videretur , et si quando quid Pompeius tardius aut consideratius faceret , unius esse negotium diei , sed illum delectari imperio et consulares praetoriosque servorum habere numero dicerent . <end>$$<start> And receiving all the legions into one camp , he shared his honors with Scipio , ordered the trumpet to be sounded at his tent , and a pavilion to be erected for him The forces of Pompey being thus augmented , and two such powerful armies united , their former expectations were confirmed , and their hopes of victory so much increased , that whatever time intervened was considered as so much delay to their return into Italy ; and whenever Pompey acted with slowness and caution , they used to exclaim , that it was the business only of a single day , but that he had a passion for power , and was delighted in having persons of consular and praetorian rank in the number of his slaves . <end>
<start> Iamque inter se palam de praemiis ac de sacerdotiis contendebant in annosque consulatum definiebant , alii domos bonaque eorum , qui in castris erant Caesaris , petebant ; magnaque inter eos in consilio fuit controversia , oporteretne Lucili Hirri , quod is a Pompeio ad Parthos missus esset , proximis comitiis praetoriis absentis rationem haberi , cum eius necessarii fidem implorarent Pompei , praestaret , quod proficiscenti recepisset , ne per eius auctoritatem deceptus videretur , reliqui , in labore pari ac periculo ne unus omnes antecederet , recusarent . <end>$$<start> And they now began to dispute openly about rewards and priesthoods , and disposed of the consulate for several years to come Others put in their claims for the houses and properties of all who were in Caesar's camp , and in that council there was a warm debate , whether Lucius Hirtius , who had been sent by Pompey against the Parthians , should be admitted a candidate for the praetorship in his absence at the next election ; his friends imploring Pompey's honor to fulfill the engagements which he had made to him at his departure , that he might not seem deceived through his authority : while others , embarked in equal labor and danger , pleaded that no individual ought to have a preference before all the rest . <end>
<start> Iam de sacerdotio Caesaris Domitius , Scipio Spintherque Lentulus cotidianis contentionibus ad gravissimas verborum contumelias palam descenderunt , cum Lentulus aetatis honorem ostentaret , Domitius urbanam gratiam dignitatemque iactaret , Scipio affinitate Pompei confideret . <end>$$<start> Already Domitius , Scipio , and Lentulus Spinther , in their daily quarrels about Caesar's priesthood , openly abused each other in the most scurrilous language . <end>
<start> Postulavit etiam Lucius Afranium proditionis exercitus Acutius Rufus apud Pompeium , quod gestum in Hispania diceret . <end>$$<start> Lentulus urging the respect due to his age , Domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity , and Scipio presuming on his alliance with Pompey . <end>
<start> Et Lucius Domitius in consilio dixit placere sibi bello confecto ternas tabellas dari ad iudicandum eis , qui ordinis essent senatorii belloque una cum ipsis interfuissent , sententiasque de singulis ferrent , qui Romae remansissent quique intra praesidia Pompei fuissent neque operam in re militari praestitissent : unam fore tabellam , qui liberandos omni periculo censerent ; alteram , qui capitis damnarent ; tertiam , qui pecunia multarent . <end>$$<start> Attius Rufus charged Lucius Afranius before Pompey with betraying the army in the action that happened in Spain , and Lucius Domitius declared in the council that it was his wish that , when the war should be ended , three billets should be given to all the senators , who had taken part with them in the war , and that they should pass sentence on every single person who had staid behind at Rome , or who had been within Pompey's garrisons and had not contributed their assistance in the military operations ; that by the first billet they should have power to acquit , by the second to pass sentence of death , and by the third to impose a pecuniary fine . <end>
<start> Postremo omnes aut de honoribus suis aut de praemiis pecuniae aut de persequendis inimicitiis agebant nec , quibus rationibus superare possent , sed , quemadmodum uti victoria deberent , cogitabant . <end>$$<start> In short , Pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the honors or sums of money which were to be their rewards , or of vengeance on their enemies ; and never considered how they were to defeat their enemies , but in what manner they should use their victory . <end>
<start> Re frumentaria praeparata confirmatisque militibus et satis longo spatio temporis a Dyrrachinis proeliis intermisso , quo satis perspectum habere militum animum videretur , temptandum Caesar existimavit , quidnam Pompeius propositi aut voluntatis ad dimicandum haberet . <end>$$<start> Corn being provided , and his soldiers refreshed , and a sufficient time having elapsed since the engagement at Dyrrachium , when Caesar thought he had sufficiently sounded the disposition of his troops , he thought that he ought to try whether Pompey had any intention or inclination to come to a battle . <end>
<start> Itaque exercitum ex castris eduxit aciemque instruxit , primum suis locis pauloque a castris Pompei longius , continentibus vero diebus , ut progrederetur a castris suis collibusque Pompeianis aciem subiceret . <end>$$<start> Accordingly he led his troops out of the camp , and ranged them in order of battle , at first on their own ground , and at a small distance from Pompey's camp : but afterward for several days in succession , he advanced from his own camp , and led them up to the hills on which Pompey's troops were posted , which conduct inspired his army every day with fresh courage . <end>
<start> Quae res in dies confirmatiorem eius exercitum efficiebat Superius tamen institutum in equitibus , quod demonstravimus , servabat , ut , quoniam numero multis partibus esset inferior , adulescentes atque expeditos ex antesignanis electis ad pernicitatem armis inter equites proeliari iuberet , qui cotidiana consuetudine usum quoque eius generis proeliorum perciperent . <end>$$<start> However he adhered to his former purpose respecting his cavalry , for as he was by many degrees inferior in number , he selected the youngest and most active of the advanced guard , and desired them to fight intermixed with the horse , and they by constant practice acquired experience in this kind of battle . <end>
<start> His erat rebus effectum , ut equitum mille etiam apertioribus locis VII milium Pompeianorum impetum , cum adesset usus , sustinere auderent neque magnopere eorum multitudine terrerentur . <end>$$<start> By these means it was brought to pass that a thousand of his horse would dare even on open ground , to stand against seven thousand of Pompey's , if occasion required , and would not be much terrified by their number . <end>
<start> Namque etiam per eos dies proelium secundum equestre fecit atque unum Allobrogem ex duobus , quos perfugisse ad Pornpeium supra docuimus , cum quibusdam interfecit . <end>$$<start> For even on one of those days he was successful in a cavalry action , and killed one of the two Allobrogians , who had deserted to Pompey , as we before observed , and several others . <end>
<start> Pompeius , qui castra in colle habebat , ad infimas radices montis aciem instruebat semper , ut videbatur , exspectans , si iniquis locis Caesar se subiceret . <end>$$<start> Pompey , because he was encamped on a hill , drew up his army at the very foot of it , ever in expectation , as may be conjectured , that Caesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous situation . <end>
<start> Caesar nulla ratione ad pugnam elici posse Pompeium existimans hanc sibi commodissimam belli rationem iudicavit , uti castra ex eo loco moveret semperque esset in itineribus , haec spectans , ut movendis castris pluribusque adeundis locis commodiore re frumentaria uteretur , simulque in itinere ut aliquam occasionem dimicandi nancisceretur et insolitum ad laborem Pompei exercitum cotidianis itineribus defatigaret . <end>$$<start> These matters being settled , when the signal for marching was given , and the tents struck , it was observed that shortly before , contrary to his daily practice , Pompey's army had advanced further than usual from his intrenchments , so that it appeared possible to come to an action on equal ground . <end>
<start> His constitutis rebus , signo iam profectionis dato tabernaculisque detensis animadversum est paulo ante extra cotidianam consuetudinem longius a vallo esse aciem Pompei progressam , ut non iniquo loco posse dimicari videretur . <end>$$<start> Then Caesar addressed himself to his soldiers , when they were at the gates of the camp , ready to march out We must defer , says he , our march at present , and set our thoughts on battle , which has been our constant wish ; let us then meet the foe with resolute souls . <end>
<start> Pompeius quoque , ut postea cognitum est , suorum omnium hortatu statuerat proelio decertare . <end>$$<start> Pompey also , as was afterward known , at the unanimous solicitation of his friends , had determined to try the fate of a battle . <end>
<start> Namque etiam in consilio superioribus diebus dixerat , priusquam concurrerent acies , fore uti exercitus Caesaris pelleretur . <end>$$<start> For he had even declared in council a few days before that , before the battalions came to battle , Caesar's army would be put to the rout . <end>
<start> Id cum essent plerique admirati , scio me , inquit , paene incredibilem rem polliceri ; sed rationem consilii mei accipite , quo firmiore animo in proelium prodeatis . <end>$$<start> When most people expressed their surprise at it , I know , says he , that I promise a thing almost incredible ; but hear the plan on which I proceed , that you may march to battle with more confidence and resolution . <end>
<start> Persuasi equitibus nostris (idque mihi facturos confirmaverunt) , ut , cum propius sit accessum , dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto aggrederentur et circumventa ab tergo acie prius perturbatum exercitum pellerent , quam a nobis telum in hostem iaceretur . <end>$$<start> I have persuaded our cavalry , and they have engaged to execute it , as soon as the two armies have met , to attack Caesar's right wing on the flank , and inclosing their army on the rear , throw them into disorder , and put them to the rout , before we shall throw a weapon against the enemy . <end>
<start> Ita sine periculo legionum et paene sine vulnere bellum conficiemus . <end>$$<start> By this means we shall put an end to the war , without endangering the legions , and almost without a blow . <end>
<start> Id autem difficile non est , cum tantum equitatu valeamus . <end>$$<start> Nor is this a difficult matter , as we far outnumber them in cavalry . <end>
<start> Simul denuntiavit , ut essent animo parati in posterum et , quoniam fieret dimicandi potestas , ut saepe rogitavissent , ne suam neu reliquorum opinionem fallerent . <end>$$<start> At the same time he gave them notice to be ready for battle on the day following , and since the opportunity which they had so often wished for was now arrived , not to disappoint the opinion generally entertained of their experience and valor . <end>
<start> Hunc Labienus excepit et , cum Caesaris copias despiceret , Pompei consilium summis laudibus efferret , noli , inquit , existimare , Pompei , hunc esse exercitum , qui Galliam Germaniamque devicerit . <end>$$<start> After him Labienus spoke , as well to express his contempt of Caesar's forces , as to extol Pompey's scheme with the highest encomiums . <end>
<start> Omnibus interfui proeliis neque temere incognitam rem pronuntio Perexigua pars illius exercitus superest ; magna pars deperiit , quod accidere tot proeliss fuit necesse , multos autumni pestilentia in Italia consumpsit , multi domum discesserunt , multi sunt relicti in continenti . <end>$$<start> Think not , Pompey , says he , that this is the army which conquered Gaul and Germany ; I was present at all those battles , and do not speak at random on a subject to which I am a stranger : a very small part of that army now remains , great numbers lost their lives , as must necessarily happen in so many battles , many fell victims to the autumnal pestilence in Italy , many returned home , and many were left behind on the continent . <end>
<start> An non audistis ex eis , qui per causam valetudinis remanserunt , cohortes esse Brundisi factas ? Hae copiae , quas videtis , ex dilectibus horum annorum in citeriore Gallia sunt refectae , et plerique sunt ex coloniis Transpadanis . <end>$$<start> Have you not heard that the cohorts at Brundusium are composed of invalids ? The forces which you now behold , have been recruited by levies lately made in Hither Spain , and the greater part from the colonies beyond the Po ; moreover , the flower of the forces perished in the two engagements at Dyrrachium . <end>
<start> Ac tamen quod fuit roboris duobus proeliis Dyrrachinis interiit Hace cum dixisset , iuravit se nisi victorem in castra non reversurum reliquosque , ut idem facerent , hortatus est . <end>$$<start> Having so said , he took an oath , never to return to his camp unless victorious ; and he encouraged the rest to do the like . <end>
<start> Hoc laudans Pompeius idem iuravit ; nec vero ex reliquis fuit quisquam , qui iurare dubitaret . <end>$$<start> Pompey applauded his proposal , and took the same oath ; nor did any person present hesitate to take it . <end>
<start> Haec cum facta sunt in consilio , magna spe et laetitia omnium discessum est ; ac iam animo victoriam praecipiebant , quod de re tanta et a tam perito imperatore nihil frustra confirmari videbatur . <end>$$<start> After this had passed in the council they broke up full of hopes and joy , and in imagination anticipated victory ; because they thought that in a matter of such importance , no groundless assertion could be made by a general of such experience . <end>
<start> Caesar , cum Pompei castris appropinquasset , ad hunc modum aciem eius instructam animadvertit Erant in sinistro cornu legiones duae traditae a Caesare initio dissensionis ex senatusconusulto ; quarum una prima , altera tertia appellabatur . <end>$$<start> When Caesar had approached near Pompey's camp , he observed that his army was drawn up in the following manner : On the left wing were the two legions , delivered over by Caesar at the beginning of the disputes in compliance with the senate's decree , one of which was called the first , the other the third . <end>
<start> In eo loco ipse erat Pompeius . <end>$$<start> Here Pompey commanded in person . <end>
<start> Mediam aciem Scipio cum legionibus Syriacis tenebat . <end>$$<start> Scipio with the Syrian legions commanded the center . <end>
<start> Ciliciensis legio coniuncta cum cohortibus Hispanis , quas traductas ab Afranio docuimus , in dextro cornu erant collocatae . <end>$$<start> The Cilician legion in conjunction with the Spanish cohorts , which we said were brought over by Afranius , were disposed on the right wing . <end>
<start> Has firmissimas se habere Pompeius existimabat . <end>$$<start> These Pompey considered his steadiest troops . <end>
<start> Reliquas inter aciem mediam cornuaque interiecerat numeroque cohortes CX expleverat . <end>$$<start> The rest he had interspersed between the center and the wing , and he had a hundred and ten complete cohorts ; these amounted to forty-five thousand men . <end>
<start> Haec erant milia XLV , evocatorum circiter duo , quae ex beneficiariis superiorum exercituum ad eum convenerant ; quae tot acie disperserat . <end>$$<start> He had besides two cohorts of volunteers , who having received favors from him in former wars , flocked to his standard : these were dispersed through his whole army . <end>
<start> Reliquas cohortes VII castris propinquisque castellis praesidio disposuerat . <end>$$<start> The seven remaining cohorts he had disposed to protect his camp , and the neighboring forts . <end>
<start> Dextrum cornu eius rivus quidam impeditis ripis muniebat ; quam ob causam cunctum equitatum , sagittarios funditoresque omnes sinistro cornu obiecerat . <end>$$<start> His right wing was secured by a river with steep banks ; for which reason he placed all his cavalry , archers , and slingers , on his left wing . <end>
<start> Caesar superius institutum servans decimam legionem in dextro cornu , nonam in sinistro collocaverat , tametsi erat Dyrrachinis proeliis vehementer attenuata , et huic sic adiunxit octavam , ut paene unam ex duabus efficeret , atque alteram alteri praesidio esse iusserat . <end>$$<start> Caesar , observing his former custom , had placed the tenth legion on the right , the ninth on the left , although it was very much weakened by the battles at Dyrrachium . <end>
<start> Cohortes in acie LXXX constitutas habebat , quae summa erat milium XXII ; cohortes VII castris praesidlo reliquerat . <end>$$<start> He placed the eighth legion so close to the ninth , as to almost make one of the two , and ordered them to support one another . <end>
<start> Sinistro cornu Antonium , dextro Publius Sullam , media acie Gnaeus Domitium praeposuerat . <end>$$<start> He drew up on the field eighty cohorts , making a total of twenty-two thousand men . <end>
<start> Ipse contra Pompeium constitit . <end>$$<start> He left two cohorts to guard the camp . <end>
<start> Simul his rebus animadversis , quas demonstravimus , timens , ne a multitudine equitum dextrum cornu circumveniretur , celeriter ex tertia acie singulas cohortes detraxit atque ex his quartam instituit equitatuique opposuit et , quid fieri vellet , ostendit monuitque eius diei victoriam in earum cohortium virtute constare . <end>$$<start> He gave the command of the left wing to Antonius , of the right to P Sulla , and of the center to Cn Domitius : he himself took his post opposite Pompey At the same time , fearing , from the disposition of the enemy which we have previously mentioned , lest his right wing might be surrounded by their numerous cavalry , he rapidly drafted a single cohort from each of the legions composing the third line , formed of them a fourth line , and opposed them to Pompey's cavalry , and , acquainting them with his wishes , admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage . <end>
<start> Simul tertiae aciei totique exercitui imperavit , ne iniussu suo concurreret : se , cum id fieri vellet , vexillo signum daturum . <end>$$<start> At the same time he ordered the third line , and the entire army not to charge without his command : that he would give the signal whenever he wished them to do so . <end>
<start> Exercitum cum militari more ad pugnam cohortaretur suaque in eum perpetui temporis officia praedicaret , imprimis commemoravit : testibus se militibus uti posse , quanto studio pacem petisset ; quae per Vatinium in colloquiis , quae per Aulum Clodium eum Scipione egisset , quibus modis ad Oricum cum Libone de mittendis legatis contendisset . <end>$$<start> When he was exhorting his army to battle , according to the military custom , and spoke to them of the favors that they had constantly received from him , he took especial care to remind them that he could call his soldiers to witness the earnestness with which he had sought peace , the efforts that he had made by Vatinius to gain a conference with Labienus , and likewise by Claudius to treat with Scipio , in what manner he had exerted himself at Oricum , to gain permission from Libo to send embassadors ; that he had been always reluctant to shed the blood of his soldiers , and did not wish to deprive the republic of one or other of her armies . <end>
<start> Erat Gaius Crastinus evocatus in exercitu Caesaris , qui superiore anno apud eum primum pilum in legione X duxerat , vir singulari virtute . <end>$$<start> There was in Caesar's army , a volunteer of the name of Crastinus , who the year before had been first centurion of the tenth legion , a man of pre-eminent bravery . <end>
<start> Hic signo dato , sequimini me , inquit , manipulares mei qui fuistis , et vestro imperatori quam constituistis operam date Unum hoc proelium superest ; quo confecto et ille suam dignitatem et nos nostram libertatem recuperabimus . <end>$$<start> He , when the signal was given , says , Follow me , my old comrades , and display such exertions in behalf of your general as you have determined to do : this is our last battle , and when it shall be won , he will recover his dignity , and we our liberty . <end>
<start> Simul respiciens Caesarem , faciam , inquit , hodie , imperator , ut aut vivo mihi aut mortuo gratias agas . <end>$$<start> At the same time he looked back to Caesar , and said , General , I will act in such a manner to-day , that you will feel grateful to me living or dead . <end>
<start> Haec cum dixisset , primus ex dextro cornu procucurrit , atque eum electi milites circiter CXX voluntarii eiusdem cohortis sunt prosecuti . <end>$$<start> After uttering these words he charged first on the right wing , and about one hundred and twenty chosen volunteers of the same century followed . <end>
<start> Quod nobis quidem nulla ratione factum a Pompeio videtur , propterea quod est quaedam animi incitatio atque alacritas naturaliter innata omnibus , quae studio pugnae incenditur ; hanc non reprimere , sed augere imperatores debent ; neque frustra antiquitus institutum est , ut signa undique concinerent clamoremque universi tollerent ; quibus rebus et hostes terreri et suos incitari existimaverunt . <end>$$<start> This a general should endeavor not to repress , but to increase ; nor was it a vain institution of our ancestors , that the trumpets should sound on all sides , and a general shout be raised ; by which they imagined that the enemy were struck with terror , and their own army inspired with courage . <end>
<start> Sed nostri milites dato signo cum infestis pilis procucurrissent atque animum advertissent non concurri a Pompeianis , usu periti ac superioribus pugnis exercitati sua sponte cursum represserunt et ad medium fere spatium constiterunt , ne consumptis viribus appropinquarent , parvoque intermisso temporis spatio ac rursus renovato cursu pila miserunt celeriterque , ut erat praeceptum a Caesare , gladios strinxerunt . <end>$$<start> But our men , when the signal was given , rushed forward with their javelins ready to be launched , but perceiving that Pompey's men did not run to meet their charge , having acquired experience by custom , and being practiced in former battles , they of their own accord repressed their speed , and halted almost midway ; that they might not come up with the enemy when their strength was exhausted , and after a short respite they again renewed their course , and threw their javelins , and instantly drew their swords , as Caesar had ordered them . <end>
<start> Neque vero Pompeiani huic rei defuerunt Nam et tela missa exceperunt et impetum legionum tulerunt et ordines suos servarunt pilisque missis ad gladios redierunt . <end>$$<start> Nor did Pompey's men fail in this crisis , for they received our javelins , stood our charge , and maintained their ranks ; and having launched their javelins , had recourse to their swords . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore equites ab sinistro Pompei cornu , ut erat imperatum , universi procucurrerunt , omnisque multitudo sagittariorum se profudit . <end>$$<start> At the same time Pompey's horse , according to their orders , rushed out at once from his left wing , and his whole host of archers poured after them . <end>
<start> Quorum impetum noster equitatus non tulit , sed paulatim loco motus cessit , equitesque Pompei hoc acrius instare et se turmatim explicare aciemque nostram a latere aperto circumire coeperunt . <end>$$<start> Our cavalry did not withstand their charge : but gave ground a little , upon which Pompey's horse pressed them more vigorously , and began to file off in troops , and flank our army . <end>
<start> Quod ubi Caesar animadvertit , quartae aciei , quam instituerat sex cohortium , dedit signum . <end>$$<start> When Caesar perceived this , he gave the signal to his fourth line , which he had formed of the six cohorts . <end>
<start> Illi celeriter procucurrerunt infestisque signis tanta vi in Pompei equites impetum fecerunt , ut eorum nemo consisteret , omnesque conversi non solum loco excederent , sed protinus incitati fuga montes altissimos peterent . <end>$$<start> They instantly rushed forward and charged Pompey's horse with such fury , that not a man of them stood ; but all wheeling about , not only quitted their post , but galloped forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountains . <end>
<start> Quibus submotis omnes sagittarii funditoresque destituti inermes sine praesidio interfecti sunt . <end>$$<start> By their retreat the archers and slingers , being left destitute and defenseless , were all cut to pieces . <end>
<start> Eodem impetu cohortes sinistrum cornu pugnantibus etiam tum ac resistentibus in acie Pompeianis circumierunt eosque a tergo sunt adorti . <end>$$<start> The cohorts , pursuing their success , wheeled about upon Pompey's left wing , while his infantry still continued to make battle , and attacked them in the rear . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore tertiam aciem Caesar , quae quieta fuerat et se ad id tempus loco tenuerat , procurrere iussit . <end>$$<start> At the same time Caesar ordered his third line to advance , which till then had not been engaged , but had kept their post . <end>
<start> Sed Pompeius , ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit atque eam partem , cui maxime confidebat , perterritam animadvertit , aliis quoque diffisus acie excessit protinusque se in castra equo contulit et eis centurionibus , quos in statione ad praetoriam portam posuerat , clare , ut milites exaudirent , tuemini , inquit , castra et defendite diligenter , si quid durius acciderit . <end>$$<start> For by them the cavalry were routed ; by them the archers and slingers were cut to pieces ; by them the left wing of Pompey's army was surrounded , and obliged to be the first to flee . <end>
<start> Caesar Pompeianis ex fuga intra vallum compulsis nullum spatium perterritis dari oportere existimans milites cohortatus est , ut beneficio fortunae uterentur castraque oppugnarent . <end>$$<start> Caesar having forced the Pompeians to flee into their intrenchment , and thinking that he ought not to allow them any respite to recover from their fright , exhorted his soldiers to take advantage of fortune's kindness , and to attack the camp . <end>
<start> Qui , etsi magno aestu fatigati (nam ad meridiem res erat perducta) , tamen ad omnem laborem animo parati imperio paruerunt . <end>$$<start> Though they were fatigued by the intense heat , for the battle had continued till mid-day , yet , being prepared to undergo any labor , they cheerfully obeyed his command . <end>
<start> Castra a cohortibus , quae ibi praesidio erant relictae , industrie defendebantur , multo etiam acrius a Thracibus barbarisque auxiliis . <end>$$<start> The camp was bravely defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard it , but with much more spirit by the Thracians and foreign auxiliaries . <end>
<start> Nam qui acie refugerant milites , et animo perterriti et lassitudine confecti , missis plerique armis signisque militaribus , magis de reliqua fuga quam de castrorum defensione cogitabant . <end>$$<start> For the soldiers who had fled for refuge to it from the field of battle , affrighted and exhausted by fatigue , having thrown away their arms and military standards , had their thoughts more engaged on their further escape than on the defense of the camp . <end>
<start> Neque vero diutius , qui in vallo constiterant , multitudinem telorum sustinere potuerunt , sed confecti vulneribus locum reliquerunt , protinusque omnes ducibus usi centurionibus tribunisque militum in altissimos montes , qui ad castra pertinebant , confugerunt . <end>$$<start> Nor could the troops who were posted on the battlements , long withstand the immense number of our darts , but fainting under their wounds , quitted the place , and under the conduct of their centurions and tribunes , fled , without stopping , to the high mountains which joined the camp . <end>
<start> In castris Pompei videre licuit trichilas structas , magnum argenti pondus eitum , recentibus caespitibus tabernacula constrata , Lucii etiam Lentuli et nonnullorum tabernacula protecta edera , multaque praeterea , quae nimiam luxuriam et victoriae fiduciam designarent , ut facile existimari posset nihil eos de eventu eius diei timuisse , qui non necessarias conquirerent voluptates . <end>$$<start> In Pompey's camp you might see arbors in which tables were laid , a large quantity of plate set out , the floors of the tents covered with fresh sods , the tents of Lucius Lentulus and others shaded with ivy , and many other things which were proofs of excessive luxury , and a confidence of victory , so that it might readily be inferred that they had no apprehensions of the issue of the day , as they indulged themselves in unnecessary pleasures , and yet upbraided with luxury Caesar's army , distressed and suffering troops , who had always been in want of common necessaries . <end>
<start> At hi miserrimo ac patientissimo exercitui Caesaris luxuriam obiciebant , cui semper omnia ad necessarium usum defuissent . <end>$$<start> Pompey , as soon as our men had forced the trenches , mounting his horse , and stripping off his general's habit , went hastily out of the back gate of the camp , and galloped with all speed to Larissa . <end>
<start> Pompeius , iam cum intra vallum nostri versarentur , equum nactus , detractis insignibus imperatoris , decumana porta se ex castris eiecit protinusque equo citato Larisam contendit Neque ibi constitit , sed eadem celeritate , paucos suos ex fuga nactus , nocturno itinere non intermisso , comitatu equitum XXX ad mare pervenit navemque frumentariam conscendit , saepe , ut dicebatur , querens tantum se opinionem fefellisse , ut , a quo genere hominum victoriam sperasset , ab eo initio fugae facto paene proditus videretur . <end>$$<start> Nor did he stop there , but with the same dispatch , collecting a few of his flying troops , and halting neither day nor night , he arrived at the seaside , attended by only thirty horse , and went on board a victualing barque , often complaining , as we have been told , that he had been so deceived in his expectation , that he was almost persuaded that he had been betrayed by those from whom he had expected victory , as they began the fight . <end>
<start> Caesar castris potitus a militibus contendit , ne in praeda occupati reliqui negotii gerendi facultatem dimitterent . <end>$$<start> Caesar having possessed himself of Pompey's camp , urged his soldiers not to be too intent on plunder , and lose the opportunity of completing their conquest . <end>
<start> Qua re impetrata montem opere circummunire instituit . <end>$$<start> Having obtained their consent , he began to draw lines round the mountain . <end>
<start> Pompeiani , quod is mons erat sine aqua , diffisi ei loco relicto monte universi iugis eius Larisam versus se recipere coeperunt Qua re animadversa Caesar copias suas divisit partemque legionum in castris Pompei remanere iussit , partem in sua castra remisit , IIII secum legiones duxit commodioreque itinere Pompeianis occurrere coepit et progressus milia passuum VI aciem instruxit . <end>$$<start> The Pompeians distrusting the position , as there was no water on the mountain , abandoned it , and all began to retreat toward Larissa ; which Caesar perceiving , divided his troops , and ordering part of his legions to remain in Pompey's camp , sent back a part to his own camp , and taking four legions with him , went by a shorter road to intercept the enemy : and having marched six miles , drew up his army . <end>
<start> Qua re animadversa Pompeiani in quodam monte constiterunt . <end>$$<start> But the Pompeians observing this , took post on a mountain , whose foot was washed by a river . <end>
<start> Hunc montem flumen subluebat Caesar milites cohortatus , etsi totius diei continenti labore erant confecti noxque iam suberat , tamen munitione flumen a monte seclusit , ne noctu aquari Pompeiani possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar having encouraged his troops , though they were greatly exhausted by incessant labor the whole day , and night was now approaching , by throwing up works cut off the communication between the river and the mountain , that the enemy might not get water in the night . <end>
<start> Quo perfecto opere illi de deditione missis legatis agere coeperunt . <end>$$<start> As soon as the work was finished , they sent embassadors to treat about a capitulation . <end>
<start> Pauci ordinis senatorii , qui se cum eis coniunxerant , nocte fuga salutem petiverunt . <end>$$<start> A few senators who had espoused that party , made their escape by night . <end>
<start> Caesar prima luce omnes eos , qui in monte consederant , ex superioribus locis in planiciem descendere atque arma proicere iussit . <end>$$<start> At break of day , Caesar ordered all those who had taken post on the mountain , to come down from the higher grounds into the plain , and pile their arms . <end>
<start> Quod ubi sine recusatione fecerunt passisque palmis proiecti ad terram flentes ab eo salutem petiverunt , consolatus consurgere iussit et pauca apud eos de lenitate sua locutus , quo minore essent timore , omnes conservavit militibusque suis commendavit , ne qui eorum violaretur , neu quid sui desiderarent . <end>$$<start> When they did this without refusal , and with outstretched arms , prostrating themselves on the ground , with tears , implored his mercy : he comforted them and bade them rise , and having spoken a few words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears , he pardoned them all , and gave orders to his soldiers , that no injury should be done to them , and nothing taken from them . <end>
<start> Hac adhibita diligentia ex castris sibi legiones alias occurrere et eas , quas secum duxerat , in vicem requiescere atque in castra reverti iussit eodemque die Larisam pervenit . <end>$$<start> Having used this diligence , he ordered the legions in his camp to come and meet him , and those which were with him to take their turn of rest , and go back to the camp : and the same day went to Larissa  . <end>
<start> In eo proelio non amplius CC milites desideravit , sed centuriones , fortes viros , circiter XXX amisit . <end>$$<start> In that battle , no more than two hundred privates were missing , but Caesar lost about thirty centurions , valiant officers . <end>
<start> Lucius Domitius ex castris in montem refugiens , cum vires eum lassitudine defecissent , ab equitibus est interfectus . <end>$$<start> Lucius Domitius , fleeing from the camp to the mountains , his strength being exhausted by fatigue , was killed by the horse . <end>
<start> Eodem tempore D Laelius cum classe ad Brundisium venit eademque ratione , qua factum a Libone antea demonstravimus , insulam obiectam portui Brundisino tenuit . <end>$$<start> About this time , Decimus Laelius arrived with his fleet at Brundusium and in the same manner , as Libo had done before , possessed himself of an island opposite the harbor of Brundusium . <end>
<start> Similiter Vatinius , qui Brundisio praeerat , tectis instructisque scaphis elicuit naves Laelianas atque ex his longius productam unam qninqueremem et minores duas in angustiis portus cepit itemque per equites dispositos aqua prohibere classiarios instituit . <end>$$<start> In like manner , Valinius , who was then governor of Brundusium , with a few decked barks , endeavored to entice Laelius's fleet , and took one five-banked galley and two smaller vessels that had ventured further than the rest into a narrow part of the harbor : and likewise disposing the horse along the shore , strove to prevent the enemy from procuring fresh water . <end>
<start> Sed Laelius tempore anni commodiore usus ad navigandum onerariis navibus Corcyra Dyrrachioque aquam suis supportabat , neque a proposito deterrebatur neque ante proelium in Thessalia factum cognitum aut ignominia amissarum navium aut necessariarum rerum inopia ex portu insulaque expelli potuit . <end>$$<start> But Laelius having chosen a more convenient season of the year for his expedition , supplied himself with water brought in transports from Corcyra and Dyrrachium , and was not deterred from his purpose ; and till he had received advice of the battle in Thessaly , he could not be forced either by the disgrace of losing his ships , or by the want of necessaries , to quit the port and islands . <end>
<start> Tantusque eo facto timor incessit , ut , cum esset legio praesidio Messanae , vix oppidum defenderetur , et nisi eo ipso tempore quidam nuntii de Caesaris victoria per dispositos equites essent allati , existimabant plerique futurum fuisse , uti amitteretur . <end>$$<start> The wind being favorable , he sent into the port about forty ships provided with combustibles , and the flame catching on both sides , five ships were burned to ashes . <end>
<start> Sed opportunissime nuntiis allatis oppidum est defensum ; Cassiusque ad Sulpicianam inde classem profectus est Vibonem , applicatisque nostris ad terram navibus pari atque antea ratione Cassius secundum nactus ventum onerarias naves praeparatas ad incendium immisit , et flamma ab utroque cornu comprensa naves sunt combustae quinque . <end>$$<start> And when the fire began to spread wider by the violence of the wind , the soldiers of the veteran legions , who had been left to guard the fleet , being considered as invalids , could not endure the disgrace , but of themselves went on board the ships and weighed anchor , and having attacked Cassius's fleet , captured two five-banked galleys , in one of which was Cassius himself ; but he made his escape by taking to a boat . <end>
<start> Neque multo post de proelio facto in Thessalia cognitum est , ut ipsis Pompeianis fides fieret ; nam ante id tempus fingi a legatis amicisque Caesaris arbitrabantur . <end>$$<start> Intelligence was shortly after received of the action in Thessaly , so well authenticated , that the Pompeians themselves gave credit to it ; for they had hitherto believed it a fiction of Caesar's lieutenants and friends . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus cognitis ex his locis Cassius cum classe discessit . <end>$$<start> Upon which intelligence Cassius departed with his fleet from that coast . <end>
<start> Caesar omnibus rebus relictis persequendum sibi Pompeium existimavit , quascumque in partes se ex fuga recepisset , ne rursus copias comparare alias et bellum renovare posset , et quantumcumque itineris equitatu efficere poterat , cotidie progrediebatur legionemque unam minoribus itineribus subsequi iussit . <end>$$<start> Caesar thought he ought to postpone all business and pursue Pompey , whithersoever he should retreat ; that he might not be able to provide fresh forces , and renew the war ; he therefore marched on every day , as far as his cavalry were able to advance , and ordered one legion to follow him by shorter journeys . <end>
<start> Idem hoc Lucius Lentulo , qui superiore anno consul fuerat , et Publius Lentulo consulari ac nonnullis aliis acciderat Rhodi ; qui cum ex fuga Pompeium sequerentur atque in insulam venissent , oppido ac portu recepti non erant missisque ad eos nuntiis , ut ex his locis discederent contra voluntatem suam naves solverant . <end>$$<start> There he is informed that , by the consent of all the inhabitants of Antioch and Roman citizens who traded there , the castle had been seized to shut him out of the town ; and that messengers had been dispatched to all those who were reported to have taken refuge in the neighboring states , that they should not come to Antioch ; that if they did , that it would be attended with imminent danger to their lives . <end>
<start> Quibus cognitis rebus Pompeius deposito adeundae Syriae consilio pecunia societatis sublata et a quibusdam privatis sumpta et aeris magno pondere ad militarem usum in naves imposito duobusque milibus hominum armatis , partim quos ex familiis societatum delegerat , partim a negotiatoribus coegerat , quosque ex suis quisque ad hanc rem idoneos existimabat , Pelusium pervenit . <end>$$<start> Pompey , being informed of these proceedings , laid aside his design of going to Syria , and having taken the public money from the farmers of the revenue , and borrowed more from some private friends , and having put on board his ships a large quantity of brass for military purposes , and two thousand armed men , whom he partly selected from the slaves of the tax farmers , and partly collected from the merchants , and such persons as each of his friends thought fit on this occasion , he sailed for Pelusium . <end>
<start> Ibi casu rex erat Ptolomaeus , puer aetate , magnis copiis cum sorore Cleopatra bellum gerens , quam paucis ante mensibus per suos propinquos atque amicos regno expulerat ; castraque Cleopatrae non longo spatio ab eius castris distabant . <end>$$<start> It happened that king Ptolemy , a minor , was there with a considerable army , engaged in war with his sister Cleopatra , whom a few months before , by the assistance of his relations and friends , he had expelled from the kingdom ; and her camp lay at a small distance from his . <end>
<start> Ad eum Pompeius misit , ut pro hospitio atque amicitia patris Alexandria reciperetur atque illius opibus in calamitate tegeretur . <end>$$<start> To him Pompey applied to be permitted to take refuge in Alexandria , and to be protected in his calamity by his powerful assistance , in consideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between his father and him . <end>
<start> Sed qui ab eo missi erant , confecto legationis officio liberius cum militibus regis colloqui coeperunt eosque hortari , ut suum officium Pompeio praestarent , neve eius fortunam despicerent . <end>$$<start> But Pompey's deputies having executed their commission , began to converse with less restraint with the king's troops , and to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey , and not to think meanly of his bad fortune . <end>
<start> In hoc erant numero complures Pompei milites , quos ex eius exercitu acceptos in Syria Gabinius Alexandriam traduxerat belloque confecto apud Ptolomaeum , patrem pueri , reliquerat . <end>$$<start> In Ptolemy's army were several of Pompey's soldiers , of whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria , and had brought them over to Alexandria , and at the conclusion of the war had left with Ptolemy the father of the young king . <end>
<start> His tum cognitis rebus amici regis , qui propter aetatem eius in procuratione erant regni , sive timore adducti , ut postea praedicabant , sollicitato exercitu regio ne Pompeius Alexandriam Aegyptumque occuparet , sive despecta eius fortuna , ut plerumque in calamitate ex amicis inimici exsistunt , his , qui erant ab eo missi , palam liberaliter responderunt eumque ad regem venire iusserunt ; ipsi clam consilio inito Achillam , praefectum regium , singulari hominem audacia , et Lucius Septimium , tribunum militum , ad interficiendum Pompeium miserunt . <end>$$<start> The king's friends , who were regents of the kingdom during the minority , being informed of these things , either induced by fear , as they afterward declared , lest Pompey should corrupt the king's army , and seize on Alexandria and Egypt ; or despising his bad fortune , as in adversity friends commonly change to enemies , in public gave a favorable answer to his deputies , and desired him to come to the king ; but secretly laid a plot against him , and dispatched Achillas , captain of the king's guards , a man of singular boldness , and Lucius Septimius a military tribune to assassinate him . <end>
<start> Ab his liberaliter ipse appellatus et quadam notitia Septimii productus , quod bello praedonum apud eum ordinem duxerat , naviculam parvulam conscendit cum paucis suis : ibi ab Achilla et Septimio interficitur . <end>$$<start> Being kindly addressed by them , and deluded by an acquaintance with Septimius , because in the war with the pirates the latter had commanded a company under him , he embarked in a small boat with a few attendants , and was there murdered by Achillas and Septimius . <end>
<start> Item Lucius Lentulus comprehenditur ab rege et in custodia necatur . <end>$$<start> In like manner , Lucius Lentulus was seized by the king's order , and put to death in prison . <end>
<start> Caesar , cum in Asiam venisset , reperiebat Titus Ampium conatum esse pecunias tollere Epheso ex fano Dianae eiusque rei causa senatores omnes ex provincia evocasse , ut his testibus in summa pecuniae uteretur , sed interpellatum adventu Caesaris profugisse . <end>$$<start> When Caesar arrived in Asia , he found that Titus Ampius had attempted to remove the money from the temple of Diana at Ephesus ; and for this purpose had convened all the senators in the province that he might have them to attest the sum , but was interrupted by Caesar's arrival , and had made his escape . <end>
<start> Eodemque die Antiochiae in Syria bis tantus exercitus clamor et signorum sonus exauditus est , ut in muris armata civitas discurreret Hoc idem Ptolomaide accidit Pergami in occultis ac reconditis templi , quo praeter sacerdotes adire fas non est , quae Graeci 'adyta' appellant , tympana sonuerunt . <end>$$<start> It was also remarked at Elis , in the temple of Minerva , upon calculating and enumerating the days , that on the very day on which Caesar had gained his battle , the image of Victory which was placed before Minerva , and faced her statue , turned about toward the portal and entrance of the temple ; and the same day , at Antioch in Syria , such a shout of an army and sound of trumpets was twice heard that the citizens ran in arms to the walls . <end>
<start> Caesar paucos dies in Asia moratus , cum audisset Pompeium Cypri visum , coniectans eum in Aegyptum iter habere propter necessitudines regni reliquasque eius loci opportunitates cum legione una , quam se ex Thessalia sequi iusserat , et altera , quam ex Achaia a Quintus Fufio legato evocaverat , equitibusque DCCC et navibus longis Rhodiis X et Asiaticis paucis Alexandriam pervenit . <end>$$<start> After a few days' delay in Asia , Caesar , having heard that Pompey had been seen in Cyprus , and conjecturing that he had directed his course into Egypt , on account of his connection with that kingdom , set out for Alexandria with two legions (one of which he ordered to follow him from Thessaly , the other he called in from Achaia , from Fufius , the lieutenant general) , and with eight hundred horse , ten ships of war from Rhodes , and a few from Asia . <end>
<start> In his erant legionibus hominum milia tria CC ; reliqui vulneribus ex proeliis et labore ac magnitudine itineris confecti consequi non potuerant . <end>$$<start> These legions amounted but to three thousand two hundred men ; the rest , disabled by wounds received in various battles , by fatigue and the length of their march , could not follow him . <end>
<start> Sed Caesar confisus fama rerum gestarum infirmis auxiliis proficisci non dubitaverat , aeque omnem sibi locum tutum fore existimans . <end>$$<start> But Caesar , relying on the fame of his exploits , did not hesitate to set forward with a feeble force , and thought that he would be secure in any place . <end>
<start> Alexandriae de Pompei morte cognoscit atque ibi primum e nave egrediens clamorem militum audit , quos rex in oppido praesidii causa reliquerat , et concursum ad se fieri videt , quod fasces anteferrentur . <end>$$<start> At Alexandria he was informed of the death of Pompey : and at his landing there , heard a cry among the soldiers whom the king had left to garrison the town , and saw a crowd gathering toward him , because the fasces were carried before him ; for this the whole multitude thought an infringement of the king's dignity . <end>
<start> In hoc omnis multitudo maiestatem regiam minui praedicabat Hoc sedato tumultu crebrae continuis diebus ex concursu multitudinis concitationes fiebant , compluresque milites huius urbis omnibus partibus interficiebantur . <end>$$<start> Though this tumult was appeased , frequent disturbances were raised for several days successively , by crowds of the populace , and a great many of his soldiers were killed in all parts of the city . <end>
<start> Quibus rebus animadversis legiones sibi alias ex Asia adduci iussit , quas ex Pompeianis militibus confecerat Ipse enim necessario etesiis tenebatur , qui navigantibus Alexandria flant adversissimi venti . <end>$$<start> Having observed this , he ordered other legions to be brought to him from Asia , which he had made up out of Pompey's soldiers ; for he was himself detained against his will , by the etesian winds , which are totally unfavorable to persons on a voyage from Alexandria . <end>
<start> Interim controversias regum ad populum Romanum et ad se , quod esset consul , pertinere existimans atque eo magis officio suo convenire , quod superiore consulatu cum patre Ptolomaeo et lege et senatusconsulto societas erat facta , ostendit sibi placere regem Ptolomaeum atque eius sororem Cleopatram exercitus , quos haberent , dimittere et de controversiis iure apud se potius quam inter se armis disceptare . <end>$$<start> In the mean time , considering that the disputes of the princes belonged to the jurisdiction of the Roman people , and of him as consul , and that it was a duty more incumbent on him , as in his former consulate a league had been made with Ptolemy the late king , under sanction both of a law and a decree of the senate , he signified that it was his pleasure that king Ptolemy , and his sister Cleopatra , should disband their armies , and decide their disputes in his presence by justice , rather than by the sword . <end>
<start> Erat in procuratione regni propter aetatem pueri nutricius eius , eunuchus nomine Pothinus . <end>$$<start> A eunuch named Pothinus , the boy's tutor , was regent of the kingdom on account of his youthfulness . <end>
<start> Is primum inter suos queri atque indignari coepit regem ad causam dicendam evocari ; deinde adiutores quosdam consilii sui nactus ex regis amicis exercitum a Pelusio clam Alexandriam evocavit atque eundem Achillam , cuius supra meminimus , omnibus copiis praefecit . <end>$$<start> He at first began to complain among his friends , and to express his indignation , that the king should be summoned to plead his cause : but afterward , having prevailed on some of those whom he had made acquainted with his views to join him he secretly called the army away from Pelusium to Alexandria , and appointed Achillas , already spoken of , commander-in-chief of the forces . <end>
<start> Hunc incitatum suis et regis inflatum pollicitationibus , quae fieri vellet , litteris nuntiisque edocuit . <end>$$<start> Him he encouraged and animated by promises both in his own and the king's name , and instructed him both by letters and messages how he should act . <end>
<start> In testamento Ptolomaei patris heredes erant scripti ex duobus filiis maior et ex duabus filiabus ea , quae aetate antecedebat Haec uti fierent , per omnes deos perque foedera , quae Romae fecisset , eodem testamento Ptolomaeus populum Romanum obtestabatur . <end>$$<start> By the will of Ptolemy the father , the elder of his two sons and the more advanced in years of his two daughters were declared his heirs , and for the more effectual performance of his intention , in the same will he conjured the Roman people by all the gods , and by the league which he had entered into at Rome , to see his will executed . <end>
<start> Tabulae testamenti unae per legatos eius Romam erant allatae , ut in aerario ponerentur (hic cum propter publicas occupationes poni non potuissent , apud Pompeium sunt depositae) , alterae eodem exemplo relictae atque obsignatae Alexandriae proferebantur . <end>$$<start> One of the copies of his will was conveyed to Rome by his embassadors to be deposited in the treasury , but the public troubles preventing it , it was lodged with Pompey : another was left sealed up , and kept at Alexandria . <end>
<start> De his rebus cum ageretur apud Caesarem , isque maxime vellet pro communi amico atque arbitro controversias regum componere , subito exercitus regius equitatusque omnis venire Alexandriam nuntiatur . <end>$$<start> While these things were debated before Caesar , and he was very anxious to settle the royal disputes as a common friend and arbitrator ; news was brought on a sudden that the king's army and all his cavalry , were on their march to Alexandria . <end>
<start> Caesaris copiae nequaquam erant tantae , ut eis , extra oppidum si esset dimicandum , confideret . <end>$$<start> His only resource was to keep within the town in the most convenient places , and get information of Achillas's designs . <end>
<start> Milites tamen omnes in armis esse iussit regemque hortatus est , ut ex suis necessariis , quos haberet maximae auctoritatis , legatos ad Achillam mitteret et , quid esset suae voluntatis , ostenderet . <end>$$<start> Dioscorides and Serapion , the persons sent by him , who had both been embassadors at Rome , and had been in great esteem with Ptolemy the father , went to Achillas . <end>
<start> A quo missi Dioscorides et Serapion , qui ambo legati Romae fuerant magnamque apud patrem Ptolomaeum auctoritatem habuerant , ad Achillam pervenerunt . <end>$$<start> But as soon as they appeared in his presence , without hearing them , or learning the occasion of their coming , he ordered them to be seized and put to death . <end>
<start> Quos ille , cum in conspectum eius venissent , priusquam audiret aut , cuius rei causa missi essent , cognosceret , corripi atque interfici iussit ; quorum alter accepto vulnere occupatus per suos pro occiso sublatus , alter interfectus est . <end>$$<start> One of them , after receiving a wound , was taken up and carried off by his attendants as dead : the other was killed on the spot . <end>
<start> Erant cum Achilla eae copiae , ut neque numero neque genere hominum neque usu rei militaris contemnendae viderentur . <end>$$<start> The forces under Achillas did not seem despicable , either for number , spirit , or military experience ; for he had twenty thousand men under arms . <end>
<start> Milia enim XX in armis habebat Haec constabant ex Gabinianis militibus qui iam in consuetudinem Alexandrinae vitae ac licentiae venerant et nomen disciplinamque populi Romani dedidicerant uxoresque duxerant , ex quibus plerique liberos habebant . <end>$$<start> They consisted partly of Gabinius's soldiers , who were now become habituated to the licentious mode of living at Alexandria , and had forgotten the name and discipline of the Roman people , and had married wives there , by whom the greatest part of them had children . <end>
<start> Huc accedebant collecti ex praedonibus latronibusque Syriae Ciliciaeque provinciae finitimarumque regionum . <end>$$<start> To these was added a collection of highwaymen , and freebooters , from Syria , and the province of Cilicia , and the adjacent countries . <end>
<start> Multi praeterea capitis damnati exulesque convenerant ; figitivis omnibus nostris certus erat Alexandriae receptus certaque vitae condicio , ut dato nomine militum essent numero ; quorum si quis a domino prehenderetur , consensu militum eripiebatur , qui vim suorum , quod in simili culpa versabantur , ipsi pro suo periculo defendebant . <end>$$<start> Besides several convicts and transports had been collected : for at Alexandria all our runaway slaves were sure of finding protection for their persons on the condition that they should give in their names , and enlist as soldiers : and if any of them was apprehended by his master , he was rescued by a crowd of his fellow soldiers , who being involved in the same guilt , repelled , at the hazard of their lives , every violence offered to any of their body . <end>
<start> Hi regum amicos ad mortem deposcere , hi bona locupletum diripere , stipendii augendi causa regis domum obsidere , regno expellere alios , alios arcessere vetere quodam Alexandrini exercitus instituto consuerant . <end>$$<start> These by a prescriptive privilege of the Alexandrian army , used to demand the king's favorites to be put to death , pillage the properties of the rich to increase their pay , invest the king's palace , banish some from the kingdom , and recall others from exile . <end>
<start> Erant praeterea equitum milia duo Inveteraverant hi omnes compluribus Alexandriae bellis ; Ptolomaeum patrem in regnum reduxerant , Bibuli filios duos interfecerant , bella cum Aegyptiis gesserant . <end>$$<start> Besides these , there were two thousand horse , who had acquired the skill of veterans by being in several wars in Alexandria . <end>
<start> His copiis fidens Achillas paucitatemque militum Caesaris despiciens occupabat Alexandriam praeter eam oppidi partem , quam Caesar cum militibus tenebat , primo impetu domum eius irrumpere conatus ; sed Caesar dispositis per vias cohortibus impetum eius sustinuit . <end>$$<start> Full of confidence in his troops , and despising the small number of Caesar's soldiers , Achillas seized Alexandria , except that part of the town which Caesar occupied with his troops . <end>
<start> Itaque tanta esta contentione actum , quanta agi debuit , cum illi celerem in ea re victoriam , hi salutem suam consistere viderent . <end>$$<start> Accordingly that spirit was displayed , which ought to be displayed when the one party saw that a speedy victory depended on the issue , and the other their safety . <end>
<start> Sed rem obtinuit Caesar omnesque eas naves et reliquas , quae erant in navalibus , incendit , quod tam late tueri parva manu non poterat , confestimque ad Pharum navibus milites euit . <end>$$<start> But Caesar gained the day , and set fire to all those ships , and to others which were in the docks , because he could not guard so many places with so small a force ; and immediately he conveyed some troops to the Pharos by his ships . <end>
<start> Pharus est in insula turris magna altitudine , mirificis operibus exstructae ; quae nomen ab insula accepit . <end>$$<start> The Pharos is a tower on an island , of prodigious height , built with amazing works , and takes its name from the island . <end>
<start> In hac sunt insula domicilia Aegyptiorum et vicus oppidi magnitudine ; quaeque ibi naves imprudentia aut tempestate paulum suo cursu decesserunt , has more praedonum diripere consuerunt . <end>$$<start> This island lying over against Alexandria , forms a harbor ; but on the upper side it is connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred paces in length , made by piles sunk in the sea , and by a bridge . <end>
<start> Hoc tum veritus Caesar , hostibus in pugna occupatis , militibus eitis Pharum prehendit atque ibi praesidium posuit . <end>$$<start> And without the consent of those who are masters of the Pharos , no vessels can enter the harbor , on account of its narrowness . <end>
<start> Quibus est rebus effectum , uti tuto frumentum auxiliaque navibus ad eum supportari possent . <end>$$<start> Caesar being greatly alarmed on this account , while the enemy were engaged in battle , landed his soldiers , seized the Pharos , and placed a garrison in it . <end>
<start> Dimisit enim circum omnes propinquas provincias atque inde auxilia evocavit Reliquis oppidi partibus sic est pugnatum , ut aequo proelio discederetur et neutri pellerentur (id efficiebant angustiae loci) , paucisque utrimque interfectis Caesar loca maxime necessaria complexus noctu praemuniit . <end>$$<start> By this means he gained this point , that he could be supplied without danger with corn , and auxiliaries ; for he sent to all the neighboring countries , to demand supplies . <end>
<start> In eo tractu oppidi pars erat regiae exigua , in quam ipse habitandi causa initio erat inductus , et theatrum coniunctum domui quod arcis tenebat locum aditusque habebat ad portum et ad reliqua navalia . <end>$$<start> In other parts of the town , they fought so obstinately , that they quitted the field with equal advantage , and neither were beaten (in consequence of the narrowness of the passes) ; and a few being killed on both sides , Caesar secured the most necessary posts , and fortified them in the night . <end>
<start> Interim filia minor Ptolomaei regis vacuam possessionem regni sperans ad Achillam sese ex regia traiecit unaque bellum administrare coepit . <end>$$<start> These fortifications he increased during the succeeding days , that he might have them before him as a rampart , and not be obliged to fight against his will . <end>
<start> Sed celeriter est inter eos de principatu controversia orta ; quae res apud milites largitiones auxit ; magnis enim iacturis sibi quisque eorum animos conciliabat . <end>$$<start> In the mean time Ptolemy's younger daughter , hoping the throne would become vacant , made her escape from the palace to Achillas , and assisted him in prosecuting the war . <end>
<start> Haec dum apud hostes geruntur , Pothinus , nutricius pueri et procurator regni in parte Caesaris , cum ad Achillam nuntios mitteret hortareturque , ne negotio desisteret neve animo deficeret , indicatis deprehensisque internuntiis a Caesare est interfectus . <end>$$<start> But they soon quarreled about the command , which circumstance enlarged the presents to the soldiers , for each endeavored by great sacrifices to secure their affection . <end>
 Urbem Romam a principio reges habuere$$ ROME at the beginning was ruled by kings
 libertatem et consulatum Lucius Brutus instituit$$ Freedom and the consulship were established by Lucius Brutus
 dictaturae ad tempus sumebantur$$ Dictatorships were held for a temporary crisis
 neque decemviralis potestas ultra biennium , neque tribunorum militum consulare ius diu valuit$$ The power of the decemvirs did not last beyond two years ,  nor was the consular jurisdiction of the military tribunes of long duration
 non Cinnae , non Sullae longa dominatio$$ The despotisms of Cinna and Sulla were brief
 et Pompei Crassique potentia cito in Caesarem , Lepidi atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere , qui cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa nomine principis sub imperium accepit$$ the rule of Pompeius and of Crassus soon yielded before Caesar the arms of Lepidus and Antonius before Augustus who ,  when the world was wearied by civil strife ,  subjected it to empire under the title of Prince
 sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversa claris scriptoribus memorata sunt$$ But the successes and reverses of the old Roman people have been recorded by famous historians
 temporibusque Augusti dicendis non defuere decora ingenia , donec gliscente adulatione deterrerentur$$ and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of Augustus ,  till growing sycophancy scared them away
 Tiberii Gaique et Claudii ac Neronis res florentibus ipsis ob metum falsae , postquam occiderant , recentibus odiis compositae sunt$$ The histories of Tiberius ,  Caius ,  Claudius ,  and Nero ,  while they were in power ,  were falsified through terror ,  and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred
 inde consilium mihi pauca de Augusto et extrema tradere , mox Tiberii principatum et cetera , sine ira et studio , quorum causas procul habeo$$ Hence my purpose is to relate a few facts about Augustus , more particularly his last acts ,  then the reign of Tiberius ,  and all which follows ,  without either bitterness or partiality ,  from any motives to which I am far removed
 Postquam Bruto et Cassio caesis nulla iam publica arma , Pompeius apud Siciliam oppressus exutoque Lepido , interfecto Antonio ne Iulianis quidem partibus nisi Caesar dux reliquus , posito triumviri nomine consulem se ferens et ad tuendam plebem tribunicio iure contentum , ubi militem donis , populum annona , cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit , insurgere paulatim , munia senatus magistratuum legum in se trahere , nullo adversante , cum ferocissimi per acies aut proscriptione cecidissent , ceteri nobilium , quanto quis servitio promptior , opibus et honoribus extollerentur ac novis ex rebus aucti tuta et praesentia quam vetera et periculosa mallent$$ When after the destruction of Brutus and Cassius there was no longer any army of the Commonwealth ,  when Pompeius was crushed in Sicily ,  and when ,  with Lepidus pushed aside and Antonius slain ,  even the Julian faction had only Caesar left to lead it ,  then ,  dropping the title of triumvir ,  and giving out that he was a Consul ,  and was satisfied with a tribune's authority for the protection of the people ,  Augustus won over the soldiers with gifts ,  the populace with cheap corn ,  and all men with the sweets of repose ,  and so grew greater by degrees ,  while he concentrated in himself the functions of the Senate ,  the magistrates ,  and the laws He was wholly unopposed ,  for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle ,  or in the proscription ,  while the remaining nobles ,  the readier they were to be slaves ,  were raised the higher by wealth and promotion ,  so that ,  aggrandised by revolution ,  they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past
 neque provinciae illum rerum statum abnuebant , suspecto senatus populique imperio ob certamina potentium et avaritiam magistratuum , invalido legum auxilio quae vi ambitu postremo pecunia turbabantur$$ Nor did the provinces dislike that condition of affairs ,  for they distrusted the government of the Senate and the people ,  because of the rivalries between the leading men and the rapacity of the officials ,  while the protection of the laws was unavailing ,  as they were continually deranged by violence ,  intrigue ,  and finally by corruption
 Ceterum Augustus subsidia dominationi Claudium Marcellum sororis filium admodum adulescentem pontificatu et curuli aedilitate , Marcus Agrippam ignobilem loco , bonum militia et victoriae socium , geminatis consulatibus extulit , mox defuncto Marcello generum sumpsit$$ Augustus meanwhile ,  as supports to his despotism ,  raised to the pontificate and curule aedileship Claudius Marcellus ,  his sister's son ,  while a mere stripling ,  and Marcus Agrippa ,  of humble birth ,  a good soldier ,  and one who had shared his victory ,  to two consecutive consulships ,  and as Marcellus soon afterwards died ,  he also accepted him as his son-in-law
 Tiberium Neronem et Claudium Drusum privignos imperatoriis nominibus auxit , integra etiam tum domo sua$$ Tiberius Nero and Claudius Drusus ,  his stepsons ,  he honoured with imperial tides ,  although his own family was as yet undiminished
 nam genitos Agrippa Gaium ac Lucium in familiam Caesarum induxerat , necdum posita puerili praetexta principes iuventutis appellari , destinari consules specie recusantis flagrantissime cupiverat$$ For he had admitted the children of Agrippa ,  Caius and Lucius ,  into the house of the Caesars and before they had yet laid aside the dress of boyhood he had most fervently desired ,  with an outward show of reluctance ,  that they should be entitled princes of the youth ,  and be consuls-elect
 ut Agrippa vita concessit , Lucium Caesarem euntem ad Hispaniensis exercitus , Gaium remeantem Armenia et vulnere invalidum mors fato propera vel novercae Liviae dolus abstulit , Drusoque pridem extincto Nero solus e privignis erat , illuc cuncta vergere$$ When Agrippa died ,  and Lucius Caesar as he was on his way to our armies in Spain ,  and Caius while returning from Armenia ,  still suffering from a wound ,  were prematurely cut off by destiny ,  or by their step-mother Livia's treachery ,  Drusus too having long been dead ,  Nero remained alone of the stepsons ,  and in him everything tended to centre
 filius , collega imperii , consors tribuniciae potestatis adsumitur omnisque per exercitus ostentatur , non obscuris , ut antea , matris artibus , sed palam hortatu$$ He was adopted as a son ,  as a colleague in empire and a partner in the tribunitian power ,  and paraded through all the armies ,  no longer through his mother's secret intrigues ,  but at her open suggestion
 nam senem Augustum devinxerat adeo , uti nepotem unicum Agrippam Postumum , in insulam Planasiam proiecerit , rudem sane bonarum artium et robore corporis stolide ferocem , nullius tamen flagitii conpertum$$ For she had gained such a hold on the aged Augustus that he drove out as an exile into the island of Planasia ,  his only grandson ,  Agrippa Postumus ,  who ,  though devoid of worthy qualities ,  and having only the brute courage of physical strength ,  had not been convicted of any gross offence
 at hercule Germanicum Druso ortum octo apud Rhenum legionibus inposuit adscirique per adoptionem a Tiberio iussit , quamquam esset in domo Tiberii filius iuvenis , sed quo pluribus munimentis insisteret$$ And yet Augustus had appointed Germanicus ,  Drusus's offspring ,  to the command of eight legions on the Rhine ,  and required Tiberius to adopt him ,  although Tiberius had a son ,  now a young man ,  in his house
 bellum ea tempestate nullum nisi adversus Germanos supererat , abolendae magis infamiae ob amissum cum Quintilio Varo exercitum quam cupidine proferendi imperii aut dignum ob praemium$$ but he did it that he might have several safeguards to rest on He had no war at the time on his hands except against the Germans ,  which was rather to wipe out the disgrace of the loss of Quintilius Varus and his army than out of an ambition to extend the empire ,  or for any adequate recompense
 domi res tranquillae , eadem magistratuum vocabula$$ At home all was tranquil ,  and there were magistrates with the same titles
 iuniores post Actiacam victoriam , etiam senes plerique inter bella civium nati$$ there was a younger generation ,  sprung up since the victory of Actium ,  and even many of the older men had been born during the civil wars
 quotus quisque reliquus qui rem publicam vidisset$$ How few were left who had seen the republic!
 Igitur verso civitatis statu nihil usquam prisci et integri moris$$ Thus the State had been revolutionised ,  and there was not a vestige left of the old sound morality
 omnes exuta aequalitate iussa principis aspectare , nulla in praesens formidine , dum Augustus aetate validus seque et domum in pacem sustentavit$$ Stript of equality ,  all looked up to the commands of a sovereign without the least apprehension for the present ,  while Augustus in the vigour of life ,  could maintain his own position ,  that of his house ,  and the general tranquillity
 postquam provecta iam senectus aegro et corpore fatigabatur , aderatque finis et spes novae , pauci bona libertatis in cassum disserere , plures bellum pavescere , alii cupere$$ When in advanced old age ,  he was worn out by a sickly frame ,  and the end was near and new prospects opened ,  a few spoke in vain of the blessings of freedom ,  but most people dreaded and some longed for war
 pars multo maxima inminentis dominos variis rumoribus differebant$$ The popular gossip of the large majority fastened itself variously on their future masters
 trucem Agrippam et ignominia accensum non aetate neque rerum experientia tantae moli parem , Tiberium Neronem maturum annis , spectatum bello , set vetere atque insita Claudiae familiae superbia , multaque indicia saevitiae , quamquam premantur , erumpere$$ Agrippa was savage ,  and had been exasperated by insult ,  and neither from age nor experience in affairs was equal to so great a burden Tiberius Nero was of mature years ,  and had established his fame in war ,  but he had the old arrogance inbred in the Claudian family ,  and many symptoms of a cruel temper ,  though they were repressed ,  now and then broke out

 gnarum id Caesari neque multo post extincto Maximo , dubium an quaesita morte , auditos in funere eius Marciae gemitus semet incusantis , quod causa exitii marito fuisset$$ All was known to Caesar ,  and when Maximus soon afterwards died ,  by a death some thought to be self-inflicted ,  there were heard at his funeral wailings from Marcia ,  in which she reproached herself for having been the cause of her husband's destruction
 utcumque se ea res habuit , vixdum ingressus Illyricum Tiberius properis matris litteris accitur neque satis conpertum est , spirantem adhuc Augustum apud urbem Nolam an exanimem reppererit$$ Whatever the fact was ,  Tiberius as he was just entering Illyria was summoned home by an urgent letter from his mother ,  and it has not been thoroughly ascertained whether at the city of Nola he found Augustus still breathing or quite lifeless
 acribus namque custodiis domum et vias saepserat Livia , laetique interdum nuntii vulgabantur , donec provisis quae tempus monebat simul excessisse Augustum et rerum potiri Neronem fama eadem tulit$$ For Livia had surrounded the house and its approaches with a strict watch ,  and favourable bulletins were published from time to time ,  till ,  provision having been made for the demands of the crisis ,  one and the same report told men that Augustus was dead and that Tiberius Nero was master of the State
 At Romae ruere in servitium consules , patres , eques$$ Meanwhile at Rome people plunged into slavery , consuls ,  senators ,  knights
 quanto quis inlustrior , tanto magis falsi ac festinantes , vultuque composito , ne laeti excessu principis neu tristiores primordio , lacrimas gaudium , questus adulationem miscebant$$ The higher a man's rank ,  the more eager his hypocrisy ,  and his looks the more carefully studied ,  so as neither to betray joy at the decease of one emperor nor sorrow at the rise of another ,  while he mingled delight and lamentations with his flattery
 Sex Pompeius et Sex Appuleius consules primi in verba Tiberii Caesaris iuravere , apudque eos Seius Strabo et Gaius Turranius , ille praetoriarum cohortium praefectus , hic annonae$$ Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Apuleius ,  the consuls ,  were the first to swear allegiance to Tiberius Caesar ,  and in their presence the oath was taken by Seius Strabo and Caius Turranius ,  respectively the commander of the praetorian cohorts and the superintendent of the corn supplies

 ne edictum quidem , quo patres in curiam vocabat , nisi tribuniciae potestatis praescriptione posuit sub Augusto acceptae$$ Even the proclamation by which he summoned the senators to their chamber ,  he issued merely with the title of Tribune ,  which he had received under Augustus
 verba edicti fuere pauca et sensu permodesto$$ The wording of the proclamation was brief ,  and in a very modest tone
 de honoribus parentis consulturum , neque abscedere a corpore , idque unum ex publicis muneribus usurpare$$ He would ,  it said ,  provide for the honours due to his father ,  and not leave the lifeless body ,  and this was the only public duty he now claimed

 causa praecipua ex formidine , ne Germanicus , in cuius manu tot legiones , immensa sociorum auxilia , mirus apud populum favor , habere imperium quam exspectare mallet$$ His chief motive was fear that Germanicus ,  who had at his disposal so many legions ,  such vast auxiliary forces of the allies ,  and such wonderful popularity ,  might prefer the possession to the expectation of empire
 dabat et famae , ut vocatus electusque potius a re publica videretur quam per uxorium ambitum et senili adoptione inrepsisse$$ He looked also at public opinion ,  wishing to have the credit of having been called and elected by the State rather than of having crept into power through the intrigues of a wife and a dotard's adoption

 nam verba vultus in crimen detorquens recondebat$$ For he would twist a word or a look into a crime and treasure it up in his memory
 Nihil primo senatus die agi passus est nisi de supremis Augusti , cuius testamentum inlatum per virgines Vestae Tiberium et Liviam heredes habuit$$ On the first day of the Senate he allowed nothing to be discussed but the funeral of Augustus ,  whose will ,  which was brought in by the Vestal Virgins ,  named as his heirs Tiberius and Livia

 in spem secundam nepotes pronepotesque , tertio gradu primores civitatis scripserat , plerosque invisos sibi , sed iactantia gloriaque ad posteros$$ next in expectation were the grand and great-grandchildren In the third place ,  he had named the chief men of the State ,  most of whom he hated ,  simply out of ostentation and to win credit with posterity
 legata non ultra civilem modum , nisi quod opulo et plebi quadringentiens triciens quinquiens , praetoriarum cohortium militibus singula nummum milia , urbanis quingenos , legionariis aut cohortibus civium Romanorum trecenos nummos viritim dedit$$ His legacies were not beyond the scale of a private citizen ,  except a bequest of forty-three million five hundred thousand sesterces to the people and populace of Rome ,  of one thousand to every praetorian soldier ,  and of three hundred to every man in the legionary cohorts composed of Roman citizens
 tum conultatum de honoribus$$ Next followed a deliberation about funeral honours

 addebat Messalla Valerius renovandum per annos sacramentum in nomen Tiberii$$ the titles of the laws passed ,  the names of the nations conquered by Augustus were to be borne in front ,  on that of Lucius Arruntius
 interrogatusque a Tiberio num se mandante eam sententiam prompsisset , sponte dixisse respondit , neque in iis quae ad rem publicam pertinerent consilio nisi suo usurum , vel cum periculo offensionis$$ Messala Valerius further proposed that the oath of allegiance to Tiberius should be yearly renewed ,  and when Tiberius asked him whether it was at his bidding that he had brought forward this motion ,  he replied that he had proposed it spontaneously ,  and that in whatever concerned the State he would use only his own discretion ,  even at the risk of offending
 ea sola species adulandi supererat$$ This was the only style of adulation which yet remained
 conclamant patres corpus ad rogum umeris senatorum ferendum$$ The Senators unanimously exclaimed that the body ought to be borne on their shoulders to the funeral pile
 remisit Caesar adroganti moderatione , populumque edicto monuit ne , ut quondam nimiis studiis funus divi Iulii turbassent , ita Augustum in foro potius quam in campo Martis , sede destinata , cremari vellent$$ The emperor left the point to them with disdainful moderation ,  he then admonished the people by a proclamation not to indulge in that tumultuous enthusiasm which had distracted the funeral of the Divine Julius ,  or express a wish that Augustus should be burnt in the Forum instead of in his appointed resting-place in the Campus Martius
 die funeris milites velut praesidio stetere , multum inridentibus qui ipsi vierant quique a parentibus acceperant diem illum crudi adhuc servitii et libertatis inprospere repetitae , cum occisus dictator Caesar aliis pessimum , aliis pulcherrimum facinus videretur$$ On the day of the funeral soldiers stood round as a guard ,  amid much ridicule from those who had either themselves witnessed or who had heard from their parents of the famous day when slavery was still something fresh ,  and freedom had been resought in vain ,  when the slaying of Caesar ,  the Dictator ,  seemed to some the vilest ,  to others ,  the most glorious of deeds
 nunc senem principem , longa potentia , provisis etiam heredum in rem publicam opibus , auxilio scilicet militari tuendum , ut sepultura eius quieta foret$$ Now ,  they said ,  an aged sovereign ,  whose power had lasted long ,  who had provided his heirs with abundant means to coerce the State ,  requires forsooth the defence of soldiers that his burial may be undisturbed
 Multus hinc ipso de Augusto sermo , plerisque vana mirantibus , quod idem dies accepti quondam imperii princeps et vitae supremus , quod Nolae in domo et cubiculo in quo pater eius Octavius vitam finivisset$$ Then followed much talk about Augustus himself ,  and many expressed an idle wonder that the same day marked the beginning of his assumption of empire and the close of his life ,  and ,  again ,  that he had ended his days at Nola in the same house and room as his father Octavius
 numerus etiam consulatuum celebrabatur , quo Valerium Corvum et Gaius Marium simul aequaverat , continuata per septem et triginta annos tribunicia potestas , nomen imperatoris semel atque viciens partum aliaque honorum mutiplicata aut nova$$ People extolled too the number of his consulships ,  in which he had equalled Valerius Corvus and Caius Marius combined ,  the continuance for thirty-seven years of the tribunitian power ,  the title of Imperator twenty-one times earned ,  and his other honours which had either frequently repeated or were wholly new
 at apud prudentes vita eius varie extollebatur arguebaturve$$ Sensible men ,  however ,  spoke variously of his life with praise and censure
 hi pietate erga parentem et necessitudine rei publicae , in qua nullus tunc legibus locus ad arma civilia actum , quae neque parari possent neque haberi per bonas artes$$ Some said that dutiful feeling towards a father ,  and the necessities of the State in which laws had then no place ,  drove him into civil war ,  which can neither be planned nor conducted on any right principles
 multa Antonio , dum interfectores patris ulcisceretur , mula Lepido concessisse$$ He had often yielded to Antonius ,  while he was taking vengeance on his father's murderers ,  often also to Lepidus
 postquam hic socordia senuerit , ille per libidines pessum datus sit , non aliud discordantis patriae remedium fuisse quam ut ab uno regeretur$$ When the latter sank into feeble dotage and the former had been ruined by his profligacy ,  the only remedy for his distracted country was the rule of a single man
 non regno tamen neque dictatura , sed principis nomine constitutam rem publicam$$ Yet the State had been organized under the name neither of a kingdom nor a dictatorship ,  but under that of a prince

 pauca admodum vi tractata quo ceteris quies esset$$ The capital had been embellished on a grand scale
 Dicebatur contra$$ It was said ,  on the other hand ,  that filial duty and State necessity were merely assumed as a mask
 pietatem erga parentem et tempora rei publicae obtentui sumpta ceterum cupidine dominandi concitos per largitionem veteranos , paratum ab adulescente privato exercitum , corruptas consulis legiones , simulatam Pompeianarum gratiam partium$$ It was really from a lust of sovereignty that he had excited the veterans by bribery ,  had ,  when a young man and a subject ,  raised an army ,  tampered with the Consul's legions ,  and feigned an attachment to the faction of Pompeius
 mox ubi decreto patrum fasces et ius praetoris invaserit , caesis Hirtio et Pansa , sive hostis illos , seu Pansam venenum vulneri adfusum , sui milites Hirtium et machinator doli Caesar abstulerat , utriusque copias ocupavisse extortum invito senatu consulatum , armaque quae in Antonium acceperit contra rem publicam versa$$ Then ,  when by a decree of the Senate he had usurped the high functions and authority of Praetor when Hirtius and Pansa were slain , whether they were destroyed by the enemy ,  or Pansa by poison infused into a wound ,  Hirtius by his own soldiers and Caesar's treacherous machinations , he at once possessed himself of both their armies ,  wrested the consulate from a reluctant Senate ,  and turned against the State the arms with which he had been intrusted against Antonius
 proscriptionem civium , divisiones agrorum ne ipsis quidem qui fecere laudatus$$ Citizens were proscribed ,  lands divided ,  without so much as the approval of those who executed these deeds
 sane Cassii et Brutorum exitus paternis inimicitiis datos , quamquam fas sit privata odia publicis utilitatibus remittere$$ Even granting that the deaths of Cassius and of the Bruti were sacrifices to a hereditary enmity (though duty requires us to waive private feuds for the sake of the public welfare) ,  still Pompeius had been deluded by the phantom of peace ,  and Lepidus by the mask of friendship
 sed Pompeium imagine pacis , sed Leidum specie amicitiae deceptos$$ Subsequently ,  Antonius had been lured on by the treaties of Tarentum and Brundisium ,  and by his marriage with the sister ,  and paid by his death the penalty of a treacherous alliance
 post Antonium , Tarentino Brundisinoque foedere et nuptiis sororis inlectum , subdolae adfinitatis poenas morte exsolvisse$$ No doubt ,  there was peace after all this ,  but it was a peace stained with blood
 pacem sine dubio post haec , verum cruentam$$ there were the disasters of Lollius and Varus ,  the murders at Rome of the Varros ,  Egnatii ,  and Juli
 Lollianas Varianasque clades , interfectos Romae Varrones , Egnatios , Iullos$$ The domestic life too of Augustus was not spared
 nec domesticis abstinebatur$$ Nero's wife had been taken from him ,  and there had been the farce of consulting the pontiffs ,  whether ,  with a child conceived and not yet born ,  she could properly marry
 abducta Neroni uxor et consulti per ludibrium pontifices an concepto necdum edito partu rite nuberet$$ There were the excesses of Quintus Tedius and Vedius Pollio
 Quintus +Tedii+ et Vedii Pollionis luxus$$ last of all ,  there was Livia ,  terrible to the State as a mother ,  terrible to the house of the Caesars as a stepmother
 postremo Livia gravis in rem publicam mater , gravis domui Caesarum noverca$$ No honour was left for the gods ,  when Augustus chose to be himself worshipped with temples and statues ,  like those of the deities ,  and with flamens and priests
 nihil deorum honoribus relictum , cum se templis et effigie numinum per flamines et sacerdotes coli vellet$$ He had not even adopted Tiberius as his successor out of affection or any regard to the State ,  but ,  having thoroughly seen his arrogant and savage temper ,  he had sought glory for himself by a contrast of extreme wickedness
 ne Tiberium quidem caritate aut rei publicae cura successorem adscitum , sed quoniam adrogantiam saevitiamque eius introspexerit , comparatione deterrima sibi gloriam quaesivisse$$ For ,  in fact ,  Augustus ,  a few years before ,  when he was a second time asking from the Senate the tribunitian power for Tiberius ,  though his speech was complimentary ,  had thrown out certain hints as to his manners ,  style ,  and habits of life ,  which he meant as reproaches ,  while he seemed to excuse
 etenim Augustus paucis ante annis , cum Tiberio tribuniciam potestatem a patribus rursum postularet , quamquam honora oratione quaedam de habitu cultuque et institutis eius iecerat , quae velut excusando exprobraret$$ However ,  when his obsequies had been duly performed ,  a temple with a religious ritual was decreed him
 Versae inde ad Tiberium preces$$ After this all prayers were addressed to Tiberius
 et ille varie diserebat de magnitudine imperii sua modestia$$ He ,  on his part ,  urged various considerations ,  the greatness of the empire ,  his distrust of himself
 solam divi Augusti mentem tantae molis capacem$$ Only ,  he said ,  the intellect of the Divine Augustus was equal to such a burden
 se in partem curarum ab illo vocatum experiendo didicisse quam arduum , quam subiectum fortunae regendi cuncta onus$$ Called as he had been by him to share his anxieties ,  he had learnt by experience how exposed to fortune's caprices was the task of universal rule
 proinde in civitate tot inlustribus viris subnixa non ad unum omnia deferrent plures facilius munia rei publicae sociatis laboribus exsecuturos$$ Consequently ,  in a state which had the support of so many great men ,  they should not put everything on one man ,  as many ,  by uniting their efforts would more easily discharge public functions
 plus in oratione tali dignitatis quam fidei erat$$ There was more grand sentiment than good faith in such words
 Tiberioque etiam in rebus quas non occuleret , seu natura sive adsuetudine , suspensa semper et obscura verba tunc vero nitenti ut sensus suos penitus abderet , in incertum et ambiguum magis implicabantur$$ Tiberius's language even in matters which he did not care to conceal ,  either from nature or habit ,  was always hesitating and obscure ,  and now that he was struggling to hide his feelings completely ,  it was all the more involved in uncertainty and doubt
 at patres , quibus unus metus si intellegere viderentur , in questus lacrimas vota effundi$$ The Senators ,  however ,  whose only fear was lest they might seem to understand him ,  burst into complaints ,  tears ,  and prayers
 ad deos , ad effigiem Augusti , ad genua ipsius o manus tendere , cum proferri libellum recitarique iussit$$ They raised their hands to the gods ,  to the statue of Augustus ,  and to the knees of Tiberius ,  when he ordered a document to be produced and read
 opes publicae continebantur , quantum civium sociorumque in armis , quot classes , regna , provinciae , tributa aut vectigalia , et necessitates ac largitiones$$ This contained a description of the resources of the State ,  of the number of citizens and allies under arms ,  of the fleets ,  subject kingdoms ,  provinces ,  taxes ,  direct and indirect ,  necessary expenses and customary bounties
 quae cuncta sua manu perscripserat Augustus addideratque consilium coercendi intra terminos imperii , incertum metu an per invidiam$$ All these details Augustus had written with his own hand ,  and had added a counsel ,  that the empire should be confined to its present limits ,  either from fear or out of jealousy
 Post quae Lucius Arruntius haud multum discrepans a Galli oratione perinde offendit , quamquam Tiberio nulla vetus in Arruntium ira$$ Next ,  Lucius Arruntius ,  who differed but little from the speech of Gallus ,  gave like offence ,  though Tiberius had no old grudge against him ,  but simply mistrusted him ,  because he was rich and daring ,  had brilliant accomplishments ,  and corresponding popularity
 sed divitem , promptum , artibus egregiis et pari fama publice , suspectabat quippe Augustus supremis sermonibus cum tractaret quinam adipisci principem locum suffecturi abnuerent aut inpares vellent vel idem possent cuperentque , M Lepidum dixerat capacem sed aspernantem , Gallum Asinium avidum et minorem , Lucius Arruntium non indignum et si casus daretur ausurum$$ For Augustus ,  when in his last conversations he was discussing who would refuse the highest place ,  though sufficiently capable ,  who would aspire to it without being equal to it ,  and who would unite both the ability and ambition ,  had described Marcus Lepidus as able but contemptuously indifferent ,  Gallus Asinius as ambitious and incapable ,  Lucius Arruntius as not unworthy of it ,  and ,  should the chance be given him ,  sure to make the venture
 de prioribus consentitur , pro Arruntio quidam Gnaeus Pisonem tradidere omnesque praeter Lepidum variis mox criminibus struente Tiberio circumventi sunt$$ About the two first there is a general agreement ,  but instead of Arruntius some have mentioned Cneius Piso ,  and all these men ,  except Lepidus ,  were soon afterwards destroyed by various charges through the contrivance of Tiberius
 etiam Quintus Haterius et Mamercus Scaurus suspicacem animum perstrinxere , Haterius cum dixis set quo usque patieris , Caesar , non adesse caput rei publicae$$ Quintus Haterius too and Mamercus Scaurus ruffled his suspicious temper ,  Haterius by having said , How long ,  Caesar ,  will you suffer the State to be without a head
 Scaurus quia dixerat spem esse ex eo non inritas fore senatus preces quod relationi consulum iure tribuniciae potestatis non intercessisset$$ Scaurus by the remark that there was a hope that the Senate's prayers would not be fruitless ,  seeing that he had not used his right as Tribune to negative the motion of the Consuls
 in Haterium statim invectus est$$ Tiberius instantly broke out into invective against Haterius
 Scaurum , cui inplacabilius irascebatur , silentio tramisit$$ Scaurus ,  with whom he was far more deeply displeased ,  he passed over in silence
 fessusque clamore omnium , expostulatione singulorum flexit paulatim , non ut fateretur suscipi a se imperium , sed ut negare et rogari desineret$$ Wearied at last by the assembly's clamorous importunity and the urgent demands of individual Senators ,  he gave way by degrees ,  not admitting that he undertook empire ,  but yet ceasing to refuse it and to be entreated
 constat Haterium , cum deprecandi causa Palatium introisset ambulantisque Tiberii genua advolveretur , prope a militibus interfectum quia Tiberius casu an manibus eius inpeditus prociderat$$ It is known that Haterius having entered the palace to ask pardon ,  and thrown himself at the knees of Tiberius as he was walking ,  was almost killed by the soldiers ,  because Tiberius fell forward ,  accidentally or from being entangled by the suppliant's hands
 neque tamen periculo talis viri mitigatus est , donec Haterius Augustam oraret eiusque curatissimis precibus protegeretur$$ Yet the peril of so great a man did not make him relent ,  till Haterius went with entreaties to Augusta ,  and was saved by her very earnest intercessions
 Tum primum e campo comitia ad patres translata sunt$$ It was then for the first time that the elections were transferred from the Campus Martius to the Senate
 nam ad eam diem , etsi potissima arbitrio principis , quaedam tamen studiis tribuum fiebant$$ For up to that day ,  though the most important rested with the emperor's choice ,  some were settled by the partialities of the tribes
 neque populus ademptum ius questus est nisi inani rumore , et senatus largitionibus ac precibus sordidis exsolutus libens tenuit , moderante Tiberio ne plures quam quattuor candidatos commendaret sine repulsa et ambitu designandos$$ Nor did the people complain of having the right taken from them ,  except in mere idle talk ,  and the Senate ,  being now released from the necessity of bribery and of degrading solicitations ,  gladly upheld the change ,  Tiberius confining himself to the recommendation of only four candidates who were to be nominated without rejection or canvass
 inter quae tribuni plebei petivere ut proprio sumptu ederent ludos qui de nomine Augusti fastis additi Augustales vocarentur$$ Meanwhile the tribunes of the people asked leave to exhibit at their own expense games to be named after Augustus and added to the Calendar as the Augustales
 sed decreta pecunia ex aerario , utque per circum triumphali veste uterentur curru vehi haud permissum$$ Money was ,  however ,  voted from the exchequer ,  and though the use of the triumphal robe in the circus was prescribed ,  it was not allowed them to ride in a chariot
 mox celebratio annua ad praetorem translata cui inter civis et peregrinos iurisdictio evenisset$$ Soon the annual celebration was transferred to the praetor ,  to whose lot fell the administration of justice between citizens and foreigners
 Postremo promptis iam et aliis seditionis ministris velut contionabundus interrogabat cur paucis centurionibus paucioribus tribunis in modum servorum oboedirent$$ At last ,  when there were others ready to be abettors of a mutiny ,  he asked ,  in the tone of a demagogue ,  why ,  like slaves ,  they submitted to a few centurions and still fewer tribunes
 quando ausuros exposcere remedia , nisi novum et nutantem adhuc principem precibus vel armis adirent$$ When ,  he said ,  will you dare to demand relief ,  if you do not go with your prayers or arms to a new and yet tottering throne
 satis per tot annos ignavia peccatum , quod tricena aut quadragena stipendia senes et plerique truncato ex vulneribus corpore tolerent$$ We have blundered enough by our tameness for so many years ,  in having to endure thirty or forty campaigns till we grow old ,  most of us with bodies maimed by wounds
 ne dimissis quidem finem esse militiae , sed apud vexillum tendentis alio vocabulo eosdem labores perferre$$ Even dismissal is not the end of our service ,  but ,  quartered under a legion's standard we toil through the same hardships under another title
 ac si quis tot casus vita superaverit , trahi adhuc diversas in terras ubi per nomen agrorum uligines paludum vel inculta montium accipiant$$ If a soldier survives so many risks ,  he is still dragged into remote regions where ,  under the name of lands ,  he receives soaking swamps or mountainous wastes
 enimvero militiam ipsam gravem , infructuosam$$ Assuredly ,  military service itself is burdensome and unprofitable
 denis in diem assibus animam et corpus aestimari$$ ten ases a day is the value set on life and limb
 hinc vestem arma tentoria , hinc saevitiam centurionum et vacationes munerum redimi$$ out of this ,  clothing ,  arms ,  tents ,  as well as the mercy of centurions and exemptions from duty have to be purchased
 at hercule verbera et vulnera , duram hiemem , exercitas aestates , bellum atrox$$ But indeed of floggings and wounds ,  of hard winters ,  wearisome summers ,  of terrible war ,  or barren peace ,  there is no end
 aut sterilem pacem sempiterna nec aliud levamentum quam si certis sub legibus militia iniretur , ut singulos denarios mererent , sextus decumus stipendii annus finem adferret , ne ultra sub vexillis tenerentur , sed isdem in castris praemium pecunia solveretur$$ Our only relief can come from military life being entered on under fixed conditions ,  from receiving each the pay of a denarius ,  and from the sixteenth year terminating our service We must be retained no longer under a standard ,  but in the same camp a compensation in money must be paid us
 an praetorias cohortis , quae binos denarios acceperint , quae post sedecim annos penatibus suis reddantur , plus periculorum suscipere$$ Do the praetorian cohorts ,  which have just got their two denarii per man ,  and which after sixteen years are restored to their homes ,  encounter more perils
 non obtrectari a se urbanas excubias$$ We do not disparage the guards of the capital
 sibi tamen apud horridas gentis e contuberniis hostem aspici$$ still ,  here amid barbarous tribes we have to face the enemy from our tents
 Adstrepebat vulgus , diversis incitamentis , hi verberum notas , illi canitiem , plurimi detrita tegmina et nudum corpus exprobrantes$$ The throng applauded from various motives ,  some pointing with indignation to the marks of the lash ,  others to their grey locks ,  and most of them to their threadbare garments and naked limbs
 postremo eo furoris venere ut tres legiones miscere in unam agitaverint$$ At ,  last ,  in their fury they went so far as to propose to combine the three legions into one
 depulsi aemulatione , quia suae quisque legioni eum honorem quaerebant , alio vertunt atque una tres aquilas et signa cohortium locant$$ Driven from their purpose by the jealousy with which every one sought the chief honour for his own legion ,  they turned to other thoughts ,  and set up in one spot the three eagles ,  with the ensigns of the cohorts
 simul congerunt caespites , exstruunt tribunal , quo magis conspicua sedes foret$$ At the same time they piled up turf and raised a mound ,  that they might have a more conspicuous meeting-place
 properantibus Blaesus advenit , increpabatque ac retinebat singulos , clamitans mea potius caede imbuite manus$$ Amid the bustle Blaesus came up He upbraided them and held back man after man with the exclamation ,  Better imbrue your hands in my blood 
 leviore flagitio legatum interficietis quam ab imperatore desciscitis$$  it will be less guilt to slay your commander than it is to be in revolt from the emperor
 aut incolumis fidem legionum retinebo aut iugulatus paenitentiam adcelerabo$$ Either living I will uphold the loyalty of the legions ,  or pierced to the heart I will hasten on your repentance
 Aggerabatur nihilo minus caespes iamque pectori usque adcreverat , cum tandem pervicacia victi inceptum omisere$$ None the less however was the mound piled up ,  and it was quite breast high when ,  at last overcome by his persistency ,  they gave up their purpose
 Blaesus multa dicendi arte non per seditionem et turbas desideria militum ad Caesarem ferenda ait , neque veteres ab imperatoribus priscis neque ipsos a divo Augusto tam nova petivisse$$ Blaesus ,  with the consummate tact of an orator ,  said ,  It is not through mutiny and tumult that the desires of the army ought to be communicated to Caesar ,  nor did our soldiers of old ever ask so novel a boon of ancient commanders ,  nor have you yourselves asked it of the Divine Augustus
 et parum in tempore incipientis principis curas onerari$$ It is far from opportune that the emperor's cares ,  now in their first beginning ,  should be aggravated
 si tamen tenderent in pace temptare quae ne civilium quidem bellorum victores expostulaverint cur contra morem obsequii , contra fas disciplinae vim meditentur$$ If ,  however ,  you are bent upon attempting in peace what even after your victory in the civil wars you did not demand ,  why ,  contrary to the habit of obedience ,  contrary to the law of discipline ,  do you meditate violence
 decernerent legatos seque coram mandata darent$$ Decide on sending envoys ,  and give them instructions in your presence
 adclamavere ut filius Blaesi tribunus legatione ea fungeretur peteretque militibus missionem ab sedecim annis$$ It was carried by acclamation that the son of Blaesus ,  one of the tribunes ,  should undertake the mission ,  and demand for the soldiers release from service after sixteen years
 cetera mandaturos ubi prima provenissent$$ He was to have the rest of their message when the first part had been successful
 profecto iuvene modi cum otium sed superbire miles quod filius legati orator publicae causae satis ostenderet necessitate expressa quae per modestiam non obtinuissent$$ After the young man departure there was comparative quiet ,  but there was an arrogant tone among the soldiers ,  to whom the fact that their commander's son was pleading their common cause clearly showed that they had wrested by compulsion what they had failed to obtain by good behaviour
 Interea manipuli ante coeptam seditionem Nauportum missi ob itinera et pontes et alios usus , postquam turbatum in castris accepere , vexilla convellunt direptisque proximis vicis ipsoque Nauporto , quod municipii instar erat , retinentis centuriones inrisu et contumeliis , postremo verberibus insectantur , praecipua in Aufidienum Rufum praefectum castrorum ira , quem dereptum vehiculo sarcinis gravant aguntque primo in agmine per ludibrium rogitantes an tam immensa onera , tam longa itinera libenter ferret$$ Meanwhile the companies which previous to the mutiny had been sent to Nauportus to make roads and bridges and for other purposes ,  when they heard of the tumult in the camp ,  tore up the standards ,  and having plundered the neighbouring villages and Nauportus itself ,  which was like a town ,  assailed the centurions who restrained them with jeers and insults ,  last of all ,  with blows Their chief rage was against Aufidienus Rufus ,  the camp-prefect ,  whom they dragged from a waggon ,  loaded with baggage ,  and drove on at the head of the column ,  asking him in ridicule whether he liked to bear such huge burdens and such long marches
 quippe Rufus diu manipularis , dein centurio , mox castris praefectus , antiquam duramque militiam revocabat , vetus operis ac laboris et eo inmitior quia toleraverat$$ Rufus ,  who had long been a common soldier ,  then a centurion ,  and subsequently camp-prefect ,  tried to revive the old severe discipline ,  inured as he was to work and toil ,  and all the sterner because he had endured
 Horum adventu redintegratur seditio et vagi circumiecta populabantur$$ On the arrival of these troops the mutiny broke out afresh ,  and straggling from the camp they plundered the neighbourhood
 Blaesus paucos , maxime praeda onustos , ad terrorem ceterorum adfici verberibus , claudi carcere iubet$$ Blaesus ordered a few who had conspicuously loaded themselves with spoil to be scourged and imprisoned as a terror to the rest
 nam etiam tum legato a centurionibus et optimo quoque manipularium parebatur$$ for ,  even as it then was ,  the commander was still obeyed by the centurions and by all the best men among the soldiers
 illi obniti trahentibus , prensare circumstantium genua , ciere modo nomina singulorum , modo centuriam quisque cuius manipularis erat , cohortem , legionem , eadem omnibus inminere clamitantes$$ As the men were dragged off ,  they struggled violently ,  clasped the knees of the bystanders ,  called to their comrades by name ,  or to the company ,  cohort ,  or legion to which they respectively belonged ,  exclaiming that all were threatened with the same fate
 simul probra in legatum cumulant , caelum ac deos obtestantur , nihil reliqui faciunt quo minus invidiam misericordiam metum et iras permoverent$$ At the same time they heaped abuse on the commander they appealed to heaven and to the gods ,  and left nothing undone by which they might excite resentment and pity ,  alarm and rage
 adcurritur ab universis , et carcere effracto solvunt vincula desertoresque ac rerum capitalium damnatos sibi iam miscent$$ They all rushed to the spot ,  broke open the guardhouse ,  unbound the prisoners ,  and were in a moment fraternising with deserters and men convicted on capital charges
 Incendebat haec fletu et pectus atque os manibus verberans$$ He inflamed their excitement by weeping and smiting his breast and face with his hands
 mox disiectis quorum per umeros sustinebatur , praeceps et singulorum pedibus advolutus tantum consternationis invidiaeque concivit , ut pars militum gladiatores , qui e servitio Blaesi erant , pars ceteram eiusdem familiam vincirent , alii ad quaerendum corpus effunderentur$$ Then ,  hurling aside those who bore him on their shoulders ,  and impetuously flinging himself at the feet of one man after another ,  he roused such dismay and indignation that some of the soldiers put fetters on the gladiators who were among the number of Blaesus's slaves ,  others did the like to the rest of his household ,  while a third party hurried out to look for the corpse
 ac ni propere neque corpus ullum reperiri , et servos adhibitis cruciatibus abnuere caedem , neque illi fuisse umquam fratrem pernotuisset , haud multum ab exitio legati aberant$$ And had it not quickly been known that no corpse was found ,  that the slaves ,  when tortures were applied ,  denied the murder ,  and that the man never had a brother ,  they would have been on the point of destroying the general
 tribunos tamen ac praefectum castrorum extrusere , sarcinae fugientium direptae , et centurio Lucilius interficitur cui militaribus facetiis vocabulum cedo alteram indiderant , quia fracta vite in tergo militis alteram clara voce ac rursus aliam poscebat$$ As it was ,  they thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect they plundered the baggage of the fugitives ,  and they killed a centurion ,  Lucilius ,  to whom ,  with soldiers' humour ,  they had given the name Bring another ,  because when he had broken one vine-stick on a man's back ,  he would call in a loud voice for another and another
 ceteros latebrae texere , uno retento Clemente Iulio qui perferendis militum mandatis habebatur idoneus ob promptum ingenium$$ The rest sheltered themselves in concealment ,  and one only was detained ,  Clemens Julius ,  whom the soldiers considered a fit person to carry messages ,  from his ready wit
 quin ipsae inter se legiones octava et quinta decuma ferrum parabant , dum centurionem cognomento Sirpicum illa morti deposcit , quintadecumani tuentur , ni miles nonanus preces et adversum aspernantis minas interiecisset$$ Two legions ,  the eighth and the fifteenth ,  were actually drawing swords against each other ,  the former demanding the death of a centurion ,  whom they nicknamed Sirpicus ,  while the men of the fifteenth defended him ,  but the soldiers of the ninth interposed their entreaties ,  and when these were disregarded ,  their menaces
 Postquam vallum introiit , portas stationibus firmant , globos armatorum certis castrorum locis opperiri iubent$$ As soon as he entered the entrenchments ,  they secured the gates with sentries ,  and ordered bodies of armed men to be in readiness at certain points of the camp
 ceteri tribunal ingenti agmine circumveniunt$$ The rest crowded round the general's tribunal in a dense mass
 stabat Drusus silentium manu poscens$$ Drusus stood there ,  and with a gesture of his hand demanded silence
 illi quoties oculos ad multitudinem rettulerant , vocibus truculentis strepere , rursum viso Caesare trepidare$$ As often as they turned their eyes back on the throng ,  they broke into savage exclamations ,  then looking up to Drusus they trembled
 murmur incertum , atrox clamor et repente quies$$ There was a confused hum ,  a fierce shouting ,  and a sudden lull
 diversis animorum motibus pavebant terrebantque$$ Urged by conflicting emotions ,  they felt panic and they caused the like
 tandem interrupto tumultu litteras patris recitat , in quis perscriptum erat , praecipuam ipsi fortissimarum legionum curam , quibuscum plurima bella toleravisset$$ At last ,  in an interval of the uproar ,  Drusus read his father's letter ,  in which it was fully stated that he had a special care for the brave legions with which he had endured a number of campaigns
 ubi primum a luctu requiesset animus , acturum apud patres de postulatis eorum$$ that ,  as soon as his mind had recovered from its grief ,  he would lay their demands before the Senators
 misisse interim filium ut sine cunctatione concederet quae statim tribui possent cetera senatui servanda quem neque gratiae neque severitatis expertem haberi par esset$$ that meanwhile he had sent his son to concede unhesitatingly what could be immediately granted ,  and that the rest must be reserved for the Senate ,  which ought to have a voice in showing either favour or severity
 Responsum est a contione mandata Clementi centurioni quae perferret$$ The crowd replied that they had delivered their instructions to Clemens ,  one of the centurions ,  which he was to convey to Rome
 is orditur de missione a sedecim annis , de praemiis finitae militiae , ut denarius diurnum stipendium foret , ne veterani sub vexillo haberentur$$ He began to speak of the soldiers' discharge after sixteen years ,  of the rewards of completed service ,  of the daily pay being a denarius ,  and of the veterans not being detained under a standard
 ad ea Drusus cum arbitrium senatus et patris obtenderet , clamore turbatur$$ When Drusus pleaded in answer reference to the Senate and to his father ,  he was interrupted by a tumultuous shout
 cur venisset neque augendis militum stipendiis neque adlevandis laboribus , denique nulla bene faciendi licentia$$ Why had he come ,  neither to increase the soldiers' pay ,  nor to alleviate their hardships ,  in a word ,  with no power to better their lot
 at hercule verbera et necem cunctis permitti$$ Yet heaven knew that all were allowed to scourge and to execute
 Tiberium olim nomine Augusti desideria legionum frustrari solitum$$ Tiberius used formerly in the name of Augustus to frustrate the wishes of the legions ,  and the same tricks were now revived by Drusus
 easdem artis Drusum rettulisse$$ Was it only sons who were to visit them
 numquamne ad se nisi filios familiarum venturos$$ Certainly ,  it was a new thing for the emperor to refer to the Senate merely what concerned the soldier's interests
 novum id plane quod imperator sola militis commoda ad senatum reiciat$$ Was then the same Senate to be consulted whenever notice was given of an execution or of a battle
 eundem ergo senatum consulendum quotiens supplicia aut proelia indicantur$$ Were their rewards to be at the discretion of absolute rulers ,  their punishments to be without appeal
 Postremo deserunt tribunal , ut quis praetorianorum militum amicorumve Caesaris occurreret , manus intentantes , causam discordiae et initium armorum , maxime infensi Gnaeus Lentulo , quod is ante alios aetate et gloria belli firmare Drusum credebatur et illa militiae flagitia primus aspernari$$ At last they deserted the general's tribunal ,  and to any praetorian soldier or friend of Caesar's who met them ,  they used those threatening gestures which are the cause of strife and the beginning of a conflict ,  with special rage against Cneius Lentulus ,  because they thought that he above all others ,  by his age and warlike renown ,  encouraged Drusus ,  and was the first to scorn such blots on military discipline
 nec multo post digredientem cum Caesare ac provisu periculi hiberna castra repetentem circumsistunt , rogitantes quo pergeret , ad imperatorem an ad patres , ut illic quoque commodis legionum adversaretur$$ Soon after ,  as he was leaving with Drusus to betake himself in foresight of his danger to the winter camp ,  they surrounded him ,  and asked him again and again whither he was going was it to the emperor or to the Senate ,  there also to oppose the interests of the legions
 simul ingruunt , saxa iaciunt$$ At the same moment they menaced him savagely and flung stones
 iamque lapidis ictu cruentus et exitii certus adcursu multitudinis quae cum Druso advenerat protectus est$$ And now ,  bleeding from a blow ,  and feeling destruction certain ,  he was rescued by the hurried arrival of the throng which had accompanied Drusus
 Noctem minacem et in scelus erupturam fors lenivit$$ That terrible night which threatened an explosion of crime was tranquillised by a mere accident
 nam luna claro repente caelo visa languescere$$ Suddenly in a clear sky the moon's radiance seemed to die away
 id miles rationis ignarus omen praesentium accepit , suis laboribus defectionem sideris adsimulans , prospereque cessura qua pergerent si fulgor et claritudo deae redderetur$$ This the soldiers in their ignorance of the cause regarded as an omen of their condition ,  comparing the failure of her light to their own efforts ,  and imagining that their attempts would end prosperously should her brightness and splendour be restored to the goddess
 igitur aeris sono , tubarum cornuumque concentu strepere$$ And so they raised a din with brazen instruments and the combined notes of trumpets and horns ,  with joy or sorrow ,  as she brightened or grew dark
 prout splendidior obscuriorve laetari aut maerere et postquam ortae nubes offecere visui creditumque conditam tenebris , ut sunt mobiles ad superstitionem perculsae semel mentes , sibi aeternum laborem portendi , sua facinora aversari deos lamentantur$$ When clouds arose and obstructed their sight ,  and it was thought she was buried in the gloom ,  with that proneness to superstition which steals over minds once thoroughly cowed ,  they lamented that this was a portent of never-ending hardship ,  and that heaven frowned on their deeds
 utendum inclinatione ea Caesar et quae casus obtulerat in sapientiam vertenda ratus circumiri tentoria iubet$$ Drusus ,  thinking that he ought to avail himself of this change in their temper and turn what chance had offered to a wise account ,  ordered the tents to be visited
 accitur centurio Clemens et si alii bonis artibus grati in vulgus$$ Clemens ,  the centurion was summoned with all others who for their good qualities were liked by the common soldiers
 hi vigiliis , stationibus , custodiis portarum se inserunt , spem offerunt , metum intendunt$$ These men made their way among the patrols ,  sentries and guards of the camp-gates ,  suggesting hope or holding out threats
 quo usque filium imperatoris obsidebimus$$ How long will you besiege the emperor's son
 quis certaminum finis$$ What is to be the end of our strifes
 Percennione et Vibuleno sacramentum dicturi sumus$$ Will Percennius and Vibulenus give pay to the soldiers and land to those who have earned their discharge
 Percennius et Vibulenus stipendia militibus , agros emeritis largientur$$ In a word ,  are they ,  instead of the Neros and the Drusi ,  to control the empire of the Roman people
 denique pro Neronibus et Drusis imperium populi Romani capessent$$ Why are we not rather first in our repentance as we were last in the offence
 quin potius , ut novissimi in culpam , ita primi ad paenitentiam sumus$$ Demands made in common are granted slowly
 tarda sunt quae in commune expostulantur$$ a separate favour you may deserve and receive at the same moment
 privatam gratiam statim mereare , statim recipias$$ With minds affected by these words and growing mutually suspicious ,  they divided off the new troops from the old ,  and one legion from another
 commotis per haec mentibus et inter se suspectis , tironem a veterano$$ Then by degrees the instinct of obedience returned
 legionem a legione dissociant$$ They quitted the gates and restored to their places the standards which at the beginning of the mutiny they had grouped into one spot
 Drusus orto die et vocata contione , quamquam rudis dicendi , nobilitate ingenita incusat priora , probat praesentia$$ At daybreak Drusus called them to an assembly ,  and ,  though not a practised speaker ,  yet with natural dignity upbraided them for their past and commended their present behaviour
 negat se terrore et minis vinci$$ He was not ,  he said ,  to be conquered by terror or by threats
 flexos ad modestiam si videat , si supplices audiat , scripturum patri ut placatus legionum preces exciperet$$ Were he to see them inclining to submission and hear the language of entreaty ,  he would write to his father ,  that he might be merciful and receive the legions' petition
 orantibus rursum idem Blaesus et Lucius Aponius , eques Romanus e cohorte Drusi , Iustusque Catonius , primi ordinis centurio , ad Tiberium mittuntur$$ At their prayer ,  Blaesus and Lucius Apronius ,  a Roman knight on Drusus's staff ,  with Justus Catonius ,  a first-rank centurion ,  were again sent to Tiberius
 certatum inde sententiis , cum alii opperiendos legatos atque interim comitate permulcendum militem censerent , alii fortioribus remediis agendum nihil in vulgo modicum terrere ni paveant , ubi pertimuerint inpune contemni$$ Then ensued a conflict of opinion among them ,  some maintaining that it was best to wait the envoys' return and meanwhile humour the soldiers ,  others ,  that stronger measures ought to be used ,  inasmuch as the rabble knows no mean ,  and inspires fear ,  unless they are afraid ,  though when they have once been overawed ,  they can be safely despised
 dum superstitio urgeat , adiciendos ex duce metus sublatis seditionis auctoribus$$ While superstition still swayed them ,  the general should apply terror by removing the leaders of the mutiny
 promptum ad asperiora ingenium Druso erat$$ Drusus's temper was inclined to harsh measures
 vocatos Vibulenum et Percennium interfici iubet$$ He summoned Vibulenus and Percennius and ordered them to be put to death
 tradunt plerique intra tabernaculum ducis obrutos , alii corpora extra vallum abiecta ostentui$$ The common account is that they were buried in the general's tent ,  though according to some their bodies were flung outside the entrenchments for all to see
 Tum ut quisque praecipuus turbator conquisiti , et pars , extra castra palantes , a centurionibus aut praetoriarum cohortium militibus caesi$$ Search was then made for all the chief mutineers Some as they roamed outside the camp were cut down by the centurions or by soldiers of the praetorian cohorts
 quosdam ipsi manipuli documentum fidei tradidere$$ Some even the companies gave up in proof of their loyalty
 auxerat militum curas praematura hiems imbribus continuis adeoque saevis , ut non egredi tentoria , congregari inter se , vix tutari signa possent , quae turbine atque unda raptabantur$$ The men's troubles were increased by an early winter with continuous storms so violent that they could not go beyond their tents or meet together or keep the standards in their places ,  from which they were perpetually tom by hurricane and rain
 durabat et formido caelestis irae , nec frustra adversus impios hebescere sidera , ruere tempestates$$ And there still lingered the dread of the divine wrath nor was it without meaning ,  they thought ,  that ,  hostile to an impious host ,  the stars grew dim and storms burst over them
 non aliud malorum levamentum , quam si linquerent castra infausta temerataque et soluti piaculo suis quisque hibernis redderentur$$ Their only relief from misery was to quit an ill-omened and polluted camp ,  and ,  having purged themselves of their guilt ,  to betake themselves again every one to his winterquarters
 primum octava , dein quinta decuma legio rediere$$ First the eighth ,  then the fifteenth legion returned
 nonanus opperiendas Tiberii epistulas clamitaverat , mox desolatus aliorum discessione imminentem necessitatem sponte praevenit$$ the ninth cried again and again that they ought to wait for the letter from Tiberius ,  but soon finding themselves isolated by the departure of the rest ,  they voluntarily forestalled their inevitable fate
 et Drusus non exspectato legatorum regressu , quia praesentia satis conse derant , in urbem rediit$$ Drusus ,  without awaiting the envoys' return ,  as for the present all was quiet ,  went back to Rome
 Isdem ferme diebus isdem causis Germanicae legiones turbatae , quanto plures tanto violentius , et magna spe fore ut Germanicus Caesar imperium alterius pati nequiret daretque se legionibus vi sua cuncta tracturis$$ About the same time ,  from the same causes ,  the legions of Germany rose in mutiny ,  with a fury proportioned to their greater numbers ,  in the confident hope that Germanicus Caesar would not be able to endure another's supremacy and offer himself to the legions ,  whose strength would carry everything before it
 duo apud ripam Rheni exercitus erant$$ There were two armies on the bank of the Rhine
 cui nomen superiori sub Gaius Silio legato , inferiorem Aulus Caecina curabat$$ that named the upper army had Caius Silius for general
 regimen summae rei penes Germanicum agendo Galliarum censui tum intentum$$ the lower was under the charge of Aulus Caecina
 sed quibus Silius moderabatur , mente ambigua fortunam seditionis alienae speculabantur$$ The supreme direction rested with Germanicus ,  then busily employed in conducting the assessment of Gaul
 inferioris exercitus miles in rabiem prolapsus est , orto ab unetvicesimanis quintanisque initio , et tractis prima quoque ac vicesima legionibus nam isdem aestivis in finibus Vbiorum habebantur per otium aut levia munia$$ The troops under the control of Silius ,  with minds yet in suspense ,  watched the issue of mutiny elsewhere but the soldiers of the lower army fell into a frenzy ,  which had its beginning in the men of the twenty-first and fifth legions ,  and into which the first and twentieth were also drawn
 igitur audito fine Augusti vernacula multitudo , nuper acto in urbe dilectu , lasciviae sueta , laborum intolerans , implere ceterorum rudes animos$$ For they were all quartered in the same summer-camp ,  in the territory of the Ubii ,  enjoying ease or having only light duties
 venisse tempus quo veterani maturam missionem , iuvenes largiora stipendia , cuncti modum miseriarum exposcerent saevitiamque centurionum ulciscerentur non unus haec , ut Pannonicas inter legiones Percennius , nec apud trepidas militum auris , alios validiores exercitus respicientium , sed multa seditionis ora vocesque$$ Accordingly on hearing of the death of Augustus ,  a rabble of city slaves ,  who had been enlisted under a recent levy at Rome ,  habituated to laxity and impatient of hardship ,  filled the ignorant minds of the other soldiers with notions that the time had come when the veteran might demand a timely discharge ,  the young ,  more liberal pay ,  all ,  an end of their miseries ,  and vengeance on the cruelty of centurions
 sua in manu sitam rem Romanam , suis victoriis augeri rem publicam , in suum cognomentum adscisci imperatores$$ It was not one alone who spoke thus ,  as did Percennius among the legions of Pannonia ,  nor was it in the ears of trembling soldiers ,  who looked with apprehension to other and mightier armies ,  but there was sedition in many a face and voice
 Nec legatus obviam ibat$$ Nor did their commander check them
 quippe plurium vaecordia constantiam exemerat$$ Indeed ,  the blind rage of so many had robbed him of his resolution
 repente lymphati destrictis gladiis in centuriones invadunt ea vetustissima militaribus odiis materies et saeviendi principium$$ ,  In a sudden frenzy they rushed with drawn swords on the centurions ,  the immemorial object of the soldiers' resentment and the first cause of savage fury
 prostratos verberibus mulcant , sexageni singulos , ut numerum centurionum adaequarent$$ They threw them to the earth and beat them sorely ,  sixty to one ,  so as to correspond with the number of centurions
 tum convulsos laniatosque et partim exanimos ante vallum aut in amnem Rhenum proiciunt$$ Then tearing them from the ground ,  mangled ,  and some lifeless ,  they flung them outside the entrenchments or into the river Rhine
 Septimius cum perfugisset ad tribunal pedibusque Caecinae advolveretur , eo usque flagitatus est donec ad exitium dederetur$$ One Septimius ,  who fled to the tribunal and was grovelling at Caecina's feet ,  was persistently demanded till he was given up to destruction
 Cassius Chaerea , mox caede Gai Caesaris memoriam apud posteros adeptus , tum adulescens et animi ferox , inter obstantis et armatos ferro viam patefecit$$ Cassius Chaerea ,  who won for himself a memory with posterity by the murder of Caius Caesar ,  being then a youth of high spirit ,  cleared a passage with his sword through the armed and opposing throng
 non tribunus ultra , non castrorum praefectus ius obtinuit$$ Neither tribune nor camp-prefect maintained authority any longer
 vigilias , stationes , et si qua alia praesens usus indixerat , ipsi partiebantur$$ Patrols ,  sentries ,  and whatever else the needs of the time required ,  were distributed by the men themselves
 id militaris animos altius coniectantibus praecipuum indicium magni atque inplacabilis motus , quod neque disiecti nec paucorum instinctu , set pariter ardescerent , pariter silerent , tanta aequalitate et constantia ut regi crederes$$ To those who could guess the temper of soldiers with some penetration ,  the strongest symptom of a wide-spread and intractable commotion ,  was the fact that ,  instead of being divided or instigated by a few persons ,  they were unanimous in their fury and equally unanimous in their composure ,  with so uniform a consistency that one would have thought them to be under command
 Sed Germanicus quanto summae spei propior , tanto impensius pro Tiberio niti Sequanos proximos et Belgarum civitates in verba eius adigit$$ But the nearer Germanicus was to the highest hope ,  the more laboriously did he exert himself for Tiberius ,  and he made the neighbouring Sequani and all the Belgic states swear obedience to him
 dehinc audito legionum tumultu raptim profectus obvias extra castra habuit , deiectis in terram oculis velut paenitentia$$ On hearing of the mutiny in the legions ,  he instantly went to the spot ,  and met them outside the camp ,  eyes fixed on the ground ,  and seemingly repentant
 postquam vallum iniit dissoni questus audiri coepere$$ As soon as he entered the entrenchments ,  confused murmurs became audible
 et quidam prensa manu eius per speciem exosculandi inseruerunt digitos ut vacua dentibus ora contingeret$$ Some men ,  seizing his hand under pretence of kissing it ,  thrust his fingers into their mouths ,  that he might touch their toothless gums
 alii curvata senio membra ostendebant$$ others showed him their limbs bowed with age
 adsistentem contionem , quia permixta videbatur , discedere in manipulos iubet$$ He ordered the throng which stood near him ,  as it seemed a promiscuous gathering ,  to separate itself into its military companies
 sic melius audituros responsum$$ They replied that they would hear better as they were
 vexilla praeferri ut id saltem discerneret cohortis$$ The standards were then to be advanced ,  so that thus at least the cohorts might be distinguished
 tarde obtemperavere$$ The soldiers obeyed reluctantly
 tunc a veneratione Augusti orsus flexit ad victorias triumphosque Tiberii , praecipuis laudibus celebrans quae apud Germanias illis cum legionibus pulcherrima fecisset$$ Then beginning with a reverent mention of Augustus ,  he passed on to the victories and triumphs of Tiberius ,  dwelling with especial praise on his glorious achievements with those legions in Germany
 Italiae inde consensum , Galliarum fidem extollit$$ Next ,  he extolled the unity of Italy ,  the loyalty of Gaul ,  the entire absence of turbulence or strife
 nil usquam turbidum aut discors$$ He was heard in silence or with but a slight murmur
 Vt seditionem attigit , ubi modestia militaris , ubi veteris disciplinae decus , quonam tribunos , quo centuriones exegissent , rogitans , nudant universi corpora , cicatrices ex vulneribus , verberum notas exprobrant$$ As soon as he touched on the mutiny and asked what had become of soldierly obedience ,  of the glory of ancient discipline ,  whither they had driven their tribunes and centurions ,  they all bared their bodies and taunted him with the scars of their wounds and the marks of the lash
 mox indiscretis vocibus pretia vacationum , angustias stipendii , duritiam operum ac propriis nominibus incusant vallum , fossas , pabuli materiae lignorum adgestus , et si qua alia ex necessitate aut adversus otium castrorum quaeruntur$$ And then with confused exclamations they spoke bitterly of the prices of exemptions ,  of their scanty pay ,  of the severity of their tasks ,  with special mention of the entrenchment ,  the fosse ,  the conveyance of fodder ,  building-timber ,  firewood ,  and whatever else had to be procured from necessity ,  or as a check on idleness in the camp
 atrocissimus veteranorum clamor oriebatur , qui tricena aut supra stipendia numerantes , mederetur fessis , neu mortem in isdem laboribus , sed finem tam exercitae militiae neque inopem requiem orabant$$ The fiercest clamour arose from the veteran soldiers ,  who ,  as they counted their thirty campaigns or more ,  implored him to relieve worn-out men ,  and not let them die under the same hardships ,  but have an end of such harassing service ,  and repose without beggary
 fuere etiam qui legatam a divo Augusto pecuniam reposcerent , faustis in Germanicum ominibus$$ Some even claimed the legacy of the Divine Augustus ,  with words of good omen for Germanicus ,  and ,  should he wish for empire ,  they showed themselves abundantly willing
 et si vellet imperium promptos ostentavere$$ Thereupon ,  as though he were contracting the pollution of guilt ,  he leapt impetuously from the tribunal
 tum vero , quasi scelere contaminaretur , praeceps tribunali desiluit$$ The men opposed his departure with their weapons ,  threatening him repeatedly if he would not go back
 opposuerunt abeunti arma , minitantes , ni regrederetur at ille moriturum potius quam fidem exueret clamitans , ferrum a latere diripuit elatumque deferebat in pectus , ni proximi prensam dextram vi attinuissent$$ But Germanicus protesting that he would die rather than cast off his loyalty ,  plucked his sword from his side ,  raised it aloft and was plunging it into his breast ,  when those nearest him seized his hand and held it by force
 extrema et conglobata inter se pars contionis ac , vix credibile dictu , quidam singuli propius incedentes feriret hortabantur$$ The remotest and most densely crowded part of the throng ,  and ,  what almost passes belief ,  some ,  who came close up to him ,  urged him to strike the blow ,  and a soldier ,  by name Calusidius ,  offered him a drawn sword ,  saying that it was sharper than his own
 et miles nomine Calusidius strictum obtulit gladium , addito acutiorem esse$$ Even in their fury ,  this seemed to them a savage act and one of evil precedent ,  and there was a pause during which Caesar's friends hurried him into his tent
 Consultatum ibi de remedio$$ There they took counsel how to heal matters
 etenim nuntiabatur parari legatos qui superiorem exercitum ad causam eandem traherent$$ For news was also brought that the soldiers were preparing the despatch of envoys who were to draw the upper army into their cause
 destinatum excidio Vbiorum oppidum , imbutasque praeda manus in direptionem Galliarum erupturas$$ that the capital of the Ubii was marked out for destruction ,  and that hands with the stain of plunder on them would soon be daring enough for the pillage of Gaul
 augebat metum gnarus Romanae seditionis et , si omitteretur ripa , invasurus hostis$$ The alarm was heightened by the knowledge that the enemy was aware of the Roman mutiny ,  and would certainly attack if the Rhine bank were undefended
 at si auxilia et socii adversum abscedentis legiones armarentur , civile bellum suscipi$$ Yet if the auxiliary troops and allies were to be armed against the retiring legions ,  civil war was in fact begun
 periculosa severitas , flagitiosa largitio$$ Severity would be dangerous
 seu nihil militi sive omnia concedentur in ancipiti res publica$$ profuse liberality would be scandalous Whether all or nothing were conceded to the soldiery ,  the State was equally in jeopardy
 igitur volutatis inter se rationibus placitum ut epistulae nomine principis scriberentur missionem dari vicena stipendia meritis , exauctorari qui sena dena fecissent ac retineri sub vexillo ceterorum inmunes nisi propulsandi hostis , legata quae petiverant exsolvi duplicarique$$ Accordingly ,  having weighed their plans one against each other ,  they decided that a letter should be written in the prince's name ,  to the effect that full discharge was granted to those who had served in twenty campaigns that there was a conditional release for those who had served sixteen ,  and that they were to be retained under a standard with immunity from everything except actually keeping off the enemy
 Interea legati ab senatu regressum iam apud aram Vbiorum Germanicum adeunt$$ Meanwhile envoys from the Senate had an interview with Germanicus ,  who had now returned ,  at the Altar of the Ubii

 pavidos et conscientia vaecordes intrat metus venisse patrum iussu qui inrita facerent quae per seditionem expresserant$$ In the bewilderment of terror and conscious guilt they were penetrated by an apprehension that persons had come at the Senate's orders to cancel the concessions they had extorted by mutiny
 utque mos vulgo quamvis falsis reum subdere , Munatium Plancum consulatu functum , principem legationis , auctorem senatus consulti incusant$$ And as it is the way with a mob to fix any charge ,  however groundless ,  on some particular person ,  they reproached Manatius Plancus ,  an ex-consul and the chief envoy ,  with being the author of the Senate's decree
 et nocte concubia vexillum in domo Germanici situm flagitare occipiunt , concursuque ad ianuam facto moliuntur foris , extractum cubili Caesarem tradere vexillum intento mortis metu subigunt$$ At midnight they began to demand the imperial standard kept in Germanicus's quarters ,  and having rushed together to the entrance ,  burst the door ,  dragged Caesar from his bed ,  and forced him by menaces of death to give up the standard

 illic signa et aquilam amplexus religione sese tutabatur , ac ni aquilifer Calpurnius vim extremam arcuisset , rarum etiam inter hostis , legatus populi Romani Romanis in castris sanguine suo altaria deum commaculavisset$$ There clasping the standards and the eagle ,  he sought to protect himself under their sanctity And had not the eagle-bearer ,  Calpurnius ,  saved him from the worst violence ,  the blood of an envoy of the Roman people ,  an occurrence rare even among our foes ,  would in a Roman camp have stained the altars of the gods
 luce demum , postquam dux et miles et facta noscebantur , ingressus castra Germanicus perduci ad se Plancum imperat recepitque in tribunal$$ At last ,  with the light of day ,  when the general and the soldiers and the whole affair were clearly recognised ,  Germanicus entered the camp ,  ordered Plancus to be conducted to him ,  and received him on the tribunal
 tum fatalem increpans rabiem , neque militum sed deum ira resurgere , cur venerint legati aperit$$ He then upbraided them with their fatal infatuation ,  revived not so much by the anger of the soldiers as by that of heaven ,  and explained the reasons of the envoys' arrival
 ius legationis atque ipsius Planci gravem et immeritum casum , simul quantum dedecoris adierit legio , facunde miseratur , attonitaque magis quam quieta contione legatos praesidio auxiliarium equitum dimittit$$ On the rights of ambassadors ,  on the dreadful and undeserved peril of Plancus ,  and also on the disgrace into which the legion had brought itself ,  he dwelt with the eloquence of pity ,  and while the throng was confounded rather than appeased ,  he dismissed the envoys with an escort of auxiliary cavalry

 satis superque missione et pecunia et mollibus consultis peccatum vel si vilis ipsi salus , cur filium parvulum , cur gravidam coniugem inter furentis et omnis humani iuris violatores haberet$$ Enough and more than enough blunders ,  they said ,  had been made by granting discharges and money ,  indeed ,  by conciliatory measures Even if Germanicus held his own life cheap ,  why should he keep a little son and a pregnant wife among madmen who outraged every human right
 illos saltem avo et rei publicae redderet$$ Let these ,  at least ,  be restored safely to their grandsire and to the State
 diu cunctatus aspernantem uxorem , cum se divo Augusto ortam neque degenerem ad pericula testaretur , postremo uterum eius et communem filium multo cum fletu complexus , ut abiret perpulit$$ When his wife spurned the notion ,  protesting that she was a descendant of the Divine Augustus and could face peril with no degenerate spirit ,  he at last embraced her and the son of their love with many tears ,  and after long delay compelled her to depart

 Non florentis Caesaris neque suis in castris , sed velut in urbe victa facies gemitusque ac planctus etiam militum auris oraque advertere$$ There was no appearance of the triumphant general about Germanicus ,  and he seemed to be in a conquered city rather than in his own camp ,  while groans and wailings attracted the ears and looks even of the soldiers
 progrediuntur contuberniis$$ They came out of their tents ,  asking what was that mournful sound
 quis ille flebilis sonus$$ What meant the sad sight
 quod tam triste feminas inlustris , non centurionem ad tutelam , non militem , nihil imperatoriae uxoris aut comitatus soliti$$ Here were ladies of rank ,  not a centurion to escort them ,  not a soldier ,  no sign of a prince's wife ,  none of the usual retinue
 pergere ad Treviros et externae fidei$$ Could they be going to the Treveri ,  to be subjects of the foreigner
 pudor inde et miseratio et patris Agrippae , Augusti avi memoria , socer Drusus , ipsa insigni fecunditate , praeclara pudicitia$$ Then they felt shame and pity ,  and remembered his father Agrippa ,  her grandfather Augustus ,  her father-in-law Drusus ,  her own glory as a mother of children ,  her noble purity
 iam infans in castris genitus , in contubernio legionum eductus , quem militari vocabulo Caligulam appellabant , quia plerumque ad concilianda vulgi studia eo tegmine pedum induebatur$$ And there was her little child too ,  born in the camp ,  brought up amid the tents of the legions ,  whom they used to call in soldiers' fashion ,  Caligula ,  because he often wore the shoe so called ,  to win the men's goodwill

 isque ut erat recens dolore et ira apud circumfusos ita coepit$$ He ,  with a grief and anger that were yet fresh ,  thus began to address the throng around him -
 Non mihi uxor aut filius patre et re publica cariores sunt , sed illum quidem sua maiestas , imperium Romanum ceteri exercitus defendent$$ Neither wife nor son are dearer to me than my father and the State But he will surely have the protection of his own majesty ,  the empire of Rome that of our other armies
 coniugem et liberos meos , quos pro gloria vestra libens ad exitium offerrem , nunc procul a furentibus summoveo , ut quidquid istud sceleris imminet , meo tantum sanguine pietur , neve occisus Augusti pronepos , interfecta Tiberii nurus nocentiores vos faciant$$ My wife and children whom ,  were it a question of your glory ,  I would willingly expose to destruction ,  I now remove to a distance from your fury ,  so that whatever wickedness is thereby threatened ,  may be expiated by my blood only ,  and that you may not be made more guilty by the slaughter of a great-grandson of Augustus ,  and the murder of a daughter-in-law of Tiberius

 Igitur Germanicus quattuor legiones , quinque auxiliarium milia et tumultuarias catervas Germanorum cis Rhenum colentium Caecinae tradit$$ Germanicus accordingly gave Caecina four legions ,  five thousand auxiliaries ,  with some hastily raised levies from the Germans dwelling on the left bank of the Rhine
 totidem legiones , duplicem sociorum numerum ipse ducit , positoque castello super vestigia paterni praesidii in monte Tauno expeditum exercitum in Chattos rapit , Lucius Apronio ad munitiones viarum et fluminum relicto$$ He was himself at the head of an equal number of legions and twice as many allies Having established a fort on the site of his father's entrenchments on Mount Taunus he hurried his troops in quick marching order against the Chatti ,  leaving Lucius Apronius to direct works connected with roads and bridges
 nam (rarum illi caelo) siccitate et amnibus modicis inoffensum iter properaverat , imbresque et fluminum auctus regredienti metuebantur$$ With a dry season and comparatively shallow streams ,  a rare circumstance in that climate ,  he had accomplished ,  without obstruction ,  rapid march ,  and he feared for his return heavy rains and swollen rivers
 sed Chattis adeo inprovisus advenit , ut quod imbecillum aetate ac sexu statim captum aut trucidatum sit$$ But so suddenly did he come on the Chatti that all the helpless from age or sex were at once captured or slaughtered
 iuventus flumen Adranam nando tramiserat , Romanosque pontem coeptantis arcebant$$ Their able-bodied men had swum across the river Adrana ,  and were trying to keep back the Romans as they were commencing a bridge
 dein tormentis sagittisque pulsi , temptatis frustra condicionibus pacis , cum quidam ad Germanicum perfugissent , reliqui omissis pagis vicisque in silvas disperguntur$$ Subsequently they were driven back by missiles and arrows ,  and having in vain attempted for peace ,  some took refuge with Germanicus ,  while the rest leaving their cantons and villages dispersed themselves in their forests
 Caesar incenso Mattio (id genti caput) aperta populatus vertit ad Rhenum , non auso hoste terga abeuntium lacessere , quod illi moris , quotiens astu magis quam per formidinem cessit$$ After burning Mattium ,  the capital of the tribe ,  and ravaging the open country ,  Germanicus marched back towards the Rhine ,  the enemy not daring to harass the rear of the retiring army ,  which was his usual practice whenever he fell back by way of stratagem rather than from panic
 fuerat animus Cheruscis iuvare Chattos , sed exterruit Caecina huc illuc ferens arma$$ It had been the intention of the Cherusci to help the Chatti
 et Marsos congredi ausos prospero proelio cohibuit$$ but Caecina thoroughly cowed them ,  carrying his arms everywhere ,  and the Marsi who ventured to engage him ,  he repulsed in a successful battle
 Verba eius in hunc modum fuere$$ Segestes too was there in person ,  a stately figure ,  fearless in the remembrance of having been a faithful ally
 non hic mihi primus erga populum Romanum fidei et constantiae dies$$ His speech was to this effect
 ex quo a divo Augusto civitate donatus sum , amicos inimicosque ex vestris utilitatibus delegi , neque odio patriae (quippe proditores etiam iis quos anteponunt invisi sunt) , verum quia Romanis Germanisque idem conducere et pacem quam bellum probabam$$ This is not my first day of steadfast loyalty towards the Roman people From the time that the Divine Augustus gave me the citizenship ,  I have chosen my friends and foes with an eye to your advantage ,  not from hatred of my fatherland (for traitors are detested even by those whom they prefer) but because I held that Romans and Germans have the same interests ,  and that peace is better than war
 ergo raptorem filiae meae , violatorem foederis vestri , Arminium apud Varum , qui tum exercitui praesidebat , reum feci$$ And therefore I denounced to Varus ,  who then commanded your army ,  Arminius ,  the ravisher of my daughter ,  the violater of your treaty
 dilatus segnitia ducis , quia parum praesidii in legibus erat , ut me et Arminium et conscios vinciret flagitavi$$ I was put off by that dilatory general ,  and ,  as I found but little protection in the laws ,  I urged him to arrest myself ,  Arminius ,  and his accomplices

 ceterum et inieci catenas Arminio et a factione eius iniectas perpessus sum$$ What followed ,  may be deplored rather than defended
 atque ubi primum tui copia , vetera novis et quieta turbidis antehabeo , neque ob praemium , sed ut me perfidia exsolvam , simul genti Germanorum idoneus conciliator , si paenitentiam quam perniciem maluerit pro iuventa et errore filii veniam precor$$ However ,  I threw Arminius into chains and I endured to have them put on myself by his partisans And as soon as give opportunity ,  I show my preference for the old over the new ,  for peace over commotion ,  not to get a reward ,  but that I may clear myself from treachery and be at the same time a fit mediator for a German people ,  should they choose repentance rather than ruin ,  For the youth and error of my son I entreat forgiveness
 filiam necessitate huc adductam fateor$$ As for my daughter ,  I admit that it is by compulsion she has been brought here
 tuum erit consultare utrum praevaleat quod ex Arminio concepit an quod ex me genita est$$ It will be for you to consider which fact weighs most with you ,  that she is with child by Arminius or that she owes her being to me

 Arminium super insitam violentiam rapta uxor , subiectus servitio uxoris uterus vaecordem agebant , volitabatque per Cheruscos , arma in Segestem , arma in Caesarem poscens$$ Arminius ,  with his naturally furious temper ,  was driven to frenzy by the seizure of his wife and the foredooming to slavery of his wife's unborn child
 neque probris temperabat$$ He flew hither and thither among the Cherusci ,  demanding war against Segestes ,  war against Caesar
 egregium patrem , magnum imperatorem , fortem exercitum , quorum tot manus unam mulierculam avexerint$$ And he refrained not from taunts Noble the father ,  he would say ,  mighty the general ,  brave the army which ,  with such strength ,  has carried off one weak woman

 non enim se proditione neque adversus feminas gravidas , sed palam adversus armatos bellum tractare$$ Not by treachery ,  not against pregnant women ,  but openly against armed men do I wage war
 cerni adhuc Germanorum in lucis signa Romana , quae dis patriis suspenderit$$ There are still to be seen in the groves of Germany the Roman standards which I hung up to our country's gods

 aliis gentibus ignorantia imperi Romani inexperta esse supplicia , nescia tributa quae quoniam exuerint inritusque discesserit ille inter numina dicatus Augustus , ille delectus Tiberius , ne inperitum adulescentulum , ne seditiosum exercitum pavescerent$$ Other nations in their ignorance of Roman rule ,  have no experience of punishments ,  know nothing of tributes ,  and ,  as we have shaken them off ,  as the great Augustus ,  ranked among dieties ,  and his chosen heir Tiberius ,  departed from us ,  baffled ,  let us not quail before an inexperienced stripling ,  before a mutinous army
 si patriam parentes antiqua mallent quam domi nos et colonias novas , Arminium potius gloriae ac libertatis quam Segestem flagitiosae servitutis ducem sequerentur$$ If you prefer your fatherland ,  your ancestors ,  your ancient life to tyrants and to new colonies ,  follow as your leader Arminius to glory and to freedom rather than Segestes to ignominious servitude
 Conciti per haec non modo Cherusci , sed conterminae gentes , tractusque in partis Inguiomerus Arminii patruus , vetere apud Romanos auctoritate$$ This language roused not only the Cherusci but the neighbouring tribes and drew to their side Inguiomerus ,  the uncle of Arminius ,  who had long been respected by the Romans
 unde maior Caesari metus$$ This increased Caesar's alarm
 et ne bellum mole una ingrueret Caecinam cum quadraginta cohortibus Romanis distrahendo hosti per Bructeros ad flumen Amisiam mittit , equitem Pedo praefectus finibus Frisiorum ducit$$ That the war might not burst in all its fury on one point ,  he sent Caecina through the Bructeri to the river Amisia with forty Roman cohorts to distract the enemy ,  while the cavalry was led by its commander Pedo by the territories of the Frisii
 ipse inpositas navibus quattuor legiones per lacus vexit simulque pedes eques classis apud praedictum amnem convenere$$ Germanicus himself put four legions on shipboard and conveyed them through the lakes ,  and the infantry ,  cavalry ,  and fleet met simultaneously at the river already mentioned
 Chauci cum auxilia pollicerentur , in commilitium adsciti sunt$$ The Chauci ,  on promising aid ,  were associated with us in military fellowship
 Bructeros sua urentis expedita cum manu L Stertinius missu Germanici fudit interque caedem et praedam repperit unde vicesimae legionis aquilam cum Varo amissam$$ Lucius Stertinius was despatched by Germanicus with a flying column and routed the Bructeri as they were burning their possessions ,  and amid the carnage and plunder ,  found the eagle of the nineteenth legion which had been lost with Varus
 ductum inde agmen ad ultimos Bructerorum , quantumque Amisiam et Lupiam amnis inter vastatum , haud procul Teutoburgiensi saltu in quo reliquiae Vari legionumque insepultae dicebantur$$ The troops were then marched to the furthest frontier of the Bructeri ,  and all the country between the rivers Amisia and Luppia was ravaged ,  not far from the forest of Teutoburgium where the remains of Varus and his legions were said to lie unburied
 Igitur cupido Caesarem invadit solvendi suprema militibus ducique , permoto ad miserationem omni qui aderat exercitu ob propinquos , amicos , denique ob casus bellorum et sortem hominum$$ Germanicus upon this was seized with an eager longing to pay the last honour to those soldiers and their general ,  while the whole army present was moved to compassion by the thought of their kinsfolk and friends ,  and ,  indeed ,  of the calamities of wars and the lot of mankind
 praemisso Caecina ut occulta saltuum scrutaretur pontesque et aggeres umido paludum et fallacibus campis inponeret , incedunt maestos locos visuque ac memoria deformis$$ Having sent on Caecina in advance to reconnoitre the obscure forest-passes ,  and to raise bridges and causeways over watery swamps and treacherous plains ,  they visited the mournful scenes ,  with their horrible sights and associations
 prima Vari castra lato ambitu et dimensis principiis trium legionum manus ostentabant$$ Varus's first camp with its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly indicated the handiwork of three legions
 dein semiruto vallo , humili fossa accisae iam reliquiae consedisse intellegebantur$$ Further on ,  the partially fallen rampart and the shallow fosse suggested the inference that it was a shattered remnant of the army which had there taken up a position
 medio campi albentia ossa , ut fugerant , ut restiterant , disiecta vel aggerata$$ In the centre of the field were the whitening bones of men ,  as they had fled ,  or stood their ground ,  strewn everywhere or piled in heaps
 adiacebant fragmina telorum equorumque artus , simul truncis arborum antefixa ora$$ Near ,  lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses ,  and also human heads ,  prominently nailed to trunks of trees
 Iucis propinquis barbarae arae , apud quas tribunos ac primorum ordinum centuriones mactaverant$$ In the adjacent groves were the barbarous altars ,  on which they had immolated tribunes and first-rank centurions
 et cladis eius superstites , pugnam aut vincula elapsi , referebant hic cecidisse legatos , illic raptas aquilas primum ubi vulnus Varo adactum , ubi infelici dextera et suo ictu mortem invenerit$$ Some survivors of the disaster who had escaped from the battle or from captivity ,  described how this was the spot where the officers fell ,  how yonder the eagles were captured ,  where Varus was pierced by his first wound ,  where too by the stroke of his own ill-starred hand he found for himself death
 quo tribunali contionatus Arminius , quot patibula captivis , quae scrobes , utque signis et aquilis per superbiam inluserit$$ They pointed out too the raised ground from which Arminius had harangued his army ,  the number of gibbets for the captives ,  the pits for the living ,  and how in his exultation he insulted the standards and eagles
 Igitur Romanus qui aderat exercitus sextum post cladis annum trium legionum ossa , nullo noscente alienas reliquias an suorum humo tegeret , omnis ut coniunctos , ut consanguineos , aucta in hostem ira , maesti simul et infensi condebant$$ And so the Roman army now on the spot ,  six years after the disaster ,  in grief and anger ,  began to bury the bones of the three legions ,  not a soldier knowing whether he was interring the relics of a relative or a stranger ,  but looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood ,  while their wrath rose higher than ever against the foe
 primum extruendo tumulo caespitem Caesar posuit , gratissimo munere in defunctos et praesentibus doloris socius$$ In raising the barrow Caesar laid the first sod ,  rendering thus a most welcome honour to the dead ,  and sharing also in the sorrow of those present
 quod Tiberio haud probatum , seu cuncta Germanici in deterius trahenti , sive exercitum imagine caesorum insepultorumque tardatum ad proelia et formidolosiorem hostium credebat neque imperatorem auguratu et vetustissimis caerimoniis praeditum adtrectare feralia debuisse$$ This Tiberius did not approve ,  either interpreting unfavourably every act of Germanicus ,  or because he thought that the spectacle of the slain and unburied made the army slow to fight and more afraid of the enemy ,  and that a general invested with the augurate and its very ancient ceremonies ought not to have polluted himself with funeral rites
 Sed Germanicus cedentem in avia Arminium secutus , ubi primum copia fuit , evehi equites campumque quem hostis insederat eripi iubet$$ Germanicus ,  however ,  pursued Arminius as he fell back into trackless wilds ,  and as soon as he had the opportunity ,  ordered his cavalry to sally forth and scour the plains occupied by the enemy
 Arminius colligi suos et propinquare silvis monitos vertit repente mox signum prorumpendi dedit iis quos per saltus occultaverat$$ Arminius having bidden his men to concentrate themselves and keep close to the woods ,  suddenly wheeled round ,  and soon gave those whom he had concealed in the forest passes the signal to rush to the attack
 tunc nova acie turbatus eques , missaeque subsidiariae cohortes et fugientium agmine impulsae auxerant consternationem$$ Thereupon our cavalry was thrown into disorder by this new force ,  and some cohorts in reserve were sent ,  which ,  broken by the shock of flying troops ,  increased the panic
 trudebanturque in paludem gnaram vincentibus , iniquam nesciis , ni Caesar productas legiones instruxisset$$ They were being pushed into a swamp ,  well known to the victorious assailants ,  perilous to men unacquainted with it ,  when Caesar led forth his legions in battle array
 inde hostibus terror , fiducia militi$$ This struck terror into the enemy and gave confidence to our men ,  and they separated without advantage to either
 et manibus aequis abscessum$$ Soon afterwards Germanicus led back his army to the Amisia ,  taking his legions by the fleet ,  as he had brought them up
 , mox reducto ad Amisiam exercitu legiones classe , ut ad vexerat , reportat$$ Part of the cavalry was ordered to make for the Rhine along the sea-coast
 pars equitum litore Oceani petere Rhenum iussa Caecina , qui suum militem ducebat , monitus , quamquam notis itineribus regrederetur , pontes longos quam maturrime superare$$ Caecina ,  who commanded a division of his own ,  was advised ,  though he was returning by a route which he knew ,  to pass Long Bridges with all possible speed
 angustus is trames vastas inter paludes et quondam a Lucius Domitio aggeratus , cetera limosa , tenacia gravi caeno aut rivis incerta erant$$ This was a narrow road amid vast swamps ,  which had formerly been constructed by Lucius Domitius on every side were quagmires of thick clinging mud ,  or perilous with streams
 circum silvae paulatim adclives , quas tum Arminius inplevit , compendiis viarum et cito agmine onustum sarcinis armisque militem cum antevenisset$$ Around were woods on a gradual slope ,  which Arminius now completely occupied ,  as soon as by a short route and quick march he had outstripped troops heavily laden with baggage and arms
 Caecinae dubitanti quonam modo ruptos vetustate pontes reponeret simulque propulsaret hostem , castra metari in loco placuit , ut opus et alii proelium inciperent$$ As Caecina was in doubt how he could possibly replace bridges which were ruinous from age ,  and at the same time hold back the enemy ,  he resolved to encamp on the spot ,  that some might begin the repair and others the attack
 Barbari perfringere stationes seque inferre munitoribus nisi lacessunt , circumgrediuntur , occursant$$ The barbarians attempted to break through the outposts and to throw themselves on the engineering parties ,  which they harassed ,  pacing round them and continually charging them
 miscetur operantium bellantiumque clamor$$ There was a confused din from the men at work and the combatants
 et cuncta pariter Romanis adversa , locus uligine profunda , idem ad gradum instabilis , procedentibus lubricus , corpora gravia loricis$$ Everything alike was unfavourable to the Romans ,  the place with its deep swamps ,  insecure to the foot and slippery as one advanced ,  limbs burdened with coats of mail ,  and the impossibility of aiming their javelins amid the water
 neque librare pila inter undas poterant$$ The Cherusci ,  on the other hand ,  were familiar with fighting in fens
 contra Cheruscis sueta apud paludes proelia , procera membra , hastae ingentes ad vulnera facienda quamvis procul$$ they had huge frames ,  and lances long enough to inflict wounds even at a distance
 nox demum inclinantis iam legiones adversae pugnae exemit$$ Night at last released the legions ,  which were now wavering ,  from a disastrous engagement
 Germani ob prospera indefessi , ne tum quidem sumpta quiete , quantum aquarum circum surgentibus iugis oritur vertere in subiecta , mersaque humo et obruto quod effectum operis duplicatus militi labor$$ The Germans whom success rendered unwearied ,  without even then taking any rest ,  turned all the streams which rose from the slopes of the surrounding hills into the lands beneath The ground being thus flooded and the completed portion of our works submerged ,  the soldiers' labour was doubled
 quadragesimum id stipendium Caecina parendi aut imperitandi habebat , secundarum ambiguarumque rerum sciens eoque interritus$$ This was Caecina's fortieth campaign as a subordinate or a commander ,  and ,  with such experience of success and peril ,  he was perfectly fearless
 igitur futura volvens non aliud repperit quam ut hostem silvis coerceret , donec saucii quantumque gravioris agminis anteirent$$ As he thought over future possibilities ,  he could devise no plan but to keep the enemy within the woods ,  till the wounded and the more encumbered troops were in advance
 nam medio montium et paludum porrigebatur planities , quae tenuem aciem pateretur$$ For between the hills and the swamps there stretched a plain which would admit of an extended line
 deliguntur legiones quinta dextro lateri , unetvicesima in laevum , primani ducendum ad agmen , vicesimanus adversum secuturos$$ The legions had their assigned places ,  the fifth on the right wing ,  the twenty-first on the left ,  the men of the first to lead the van ,  the twentieth to repel pursuers
 Nox per diversa inquies , cum barbari festis epulis , laeto cantu aut truci sonore subiecta vallium ac resultantis saltus complerent , apud Romanos invalidi ignes , interruptae voces , atque ipsi passim adiacerent vallo , oberrarent tentoriis , insomnes magis quam pervigiles$$ It was a restless night for different reasons ,  the barbarians in their festivity filling the valleys under the hills and the echoing glens with merry song or savage shouts ,  while in the Roman camp were flickering fires ,  broken exclamations ,  and the men lay scattered along the intrenchments or wandered from tent to tent ,  wakeful rather than watchful
 ducemque terruit dira quies$$ A ghastly dream appalled the general
 nam Quintilium Varum sanguine oblitum et paludibus emersum cernere et audire visus est velut vocantem , non tamen obsecutus et manum intendentis reppulisse coepta luce missae in latera legiones , metu an contumacia , locum deseruere , capto propere campo umentia ultra$$ He seemed to see Quintilius Varus ,  covered with blood ,  rising out of the swamps ,  and to hear him ,  as it were ,  calling to him ,  but he did not ,  as he imagined ,  obey the call he even repelled his hand ,  as he stretched it over him At daybreak the legions ,  posted on the wings ,  from panic or perversity ,  deserted their position and hastily occupied a plain beyond the morass
 neque tamen Arminius quamquam libero incursu statim prorupit$$ Yet Arminius ,  though free to attack ,  did not at the moment rush out on them
 sed ut haesere caeno fossisque impedimenta , turbati circum milites , incertus signorum ordo , utque tali in tempore sibi quisque properus et lentae adversum imperia aures , inrumpere Germanos iubet , clamitans en Varus eodemque iterum fato vinctae legiones! simul haec et cum delectis scindit agmen equisque maxime vulnera ingerit$$ But when the baggage was clogged in the mud and in the fosses ,  the soldiers around it in disorder ,  the array of the standards in confusion ,  every one in selfish haste and all ears deaf to the word of command he ordered the Germans to charge ,  exclaiming again and again ,  Behold a Varus and legions once more entangled in Varus's fate As he spoke ,  he cut through the column with some picked men ,  inflicting wounds chiefly on the horses
 illi sanguine suo et lubrico paludum lapsantes excussis rectoribus disicere obvios , proterere iacentis$$ Staggering in their blood on the slippery marsh ,  they shook off their riders ,  driving hither and thither all in their way ,  and trampling on the fallen
 plurimus circa aquilas labor , quae neque ferri adversum ingruentia tela neque figi limosa humo poterant$$ The struggle was hottest round the eagles ,  which could neither be carried in the face of the storm of missiles ,  nor planted in the miry soil
 Caecina dum sustentat aciem , suffosso equo delapsus circumveniebatur , ni prima legio sese opposuisset$$ Caecina ,  while he was keeping up the battle ,  fell from his horse ,  which was pierced under him ,  and was being hemmed in ,  when the first legion threw itself in the way
 iuvit hostium aviditas , omissa caede praedam sectantium , enisaeque legiones vesperascente die in aperta et solida$$ The greed of the foe helped him ,  for they left the slaughter to secure the spoil ,  and the legions ,  towards evening ,  struggled on to open and firm ground
 neque is miseriarum finis$$ Nor did this end their miseries
 struendum vallum , petendus agger , amissa magna ex parte per quae egeritur humus aut exciditur caespes$$ Entrenchments had to be thrown up ,  materials sought for earthworks ,  while the army had lost to a great extent their implements for digging earth and cutting turf
 non tentoria manipulis , non fomenta sauciis$$ There were no tents for the rank and file ,  no comforts for the wounded
 infectos caeno aut cruore cibos dividentes funestas tenebras et tot hominum milibus unum iam reliquum diem lamentabantur$$ As they shared their food ,  soiled by mire or blood ,  they bewailed the darkness with its awful omen ,  and the one day which yet remained to so many thousand men
 Forte equus abruptis vinculis vagus et clamore territus quosdam occurrentium obturbavit$$ It chanced that a horse ,  which had broken its halter and wandered wildly in fright at the uproar ,  overthrew some men against whom it dashed
 tanta inde consternatio inrupisse Germanos credentium ut cuncti ruerent ad portas , quarum decumana maxime petebatur , aversa hosti et fugientibus tutior$$ Thence arose such a panic ,  from the belief that the Germans had burst into the camp ,  that all rushed to the gates Of these the decuman gate was the point chiefly sought ,  as it was furthest from the enemy and safer for flight
 Caecina comperto vanam esse formidinem , cum tamen neque auctoritate neque precibus , ne manu quidem obsistere aut retinere militem quiret , proiectus in limine portae miseratione demum , quia per corpus legati eundum erat , clausit viam$$ Caecina ,  having ascertained that the alarm was groundless ,  yet being unable to stop or stay the soldiers by authority or entreaties or even by force ,  threw himself to the earth in the gateway ,  and at last by an appeal to their pity ,  as they would have had to pass over the body of their commander ,  closed the way
 simul tribuni et centuriones falsum pavorem esse docuerunt$$ At the same moment the tribunes and the centurions convinced them that it was a false alarm
 Tunc contractos in principia iussosque dicta cum silentio accipere temporis ac necessitatis monet$$ Having then assembled them at his headquarters ,  and ordered them to hear his words in silence ,  he reminded them of the urgency of the crisis
 unam in armis salutem , sed ea consilio temperanda manendumque intra vallum , donec expugnandi hostis spe propius succederent$$ Their safety ,  he said ,  lay in their arms ,  which they must ,  however ,  use with discretion ,  and they must remain within the entrenchments ,  till the enemy approached closer ,  in the hope of storming them
 mox undique erumpendum$$ then ,  there must be a general sortie
 illa eruptione ad Rhenum perveniri$$ by that sortie the Rhine might be reached
 quod si fugerent , pluris silvas , profundas magis paludes , saevitiam hostium superesse$$ Whereas if they fled ,  more forests ,  deeper swamps ,  and a savage foe awaited them but if they were victorious ,  glory and renown would be theirs
 at victoribus decus gloriam quae domi cara , quae in castris honesta , memorat$$ He dwelt on all that was dear to them at home ,  all that testified to their honour in the camp ,  without any allusion to disaster
 reticuit de adversis equos dehinc , orsus a suis , legatorum tribunorumque nulla ambitione fortissimo cuique bellatori tradit , ut hi , mox pedes in hostem invaderent$$ Next he handed over the horses ,  beginning with his own ,  of the officers and tribunes ,  to the bravest fighters in the army ,  quite impartially ,  that these first ,  and then the infantry ,  might charge the enemy
 Haud minus inquies Cermanus spe , cupidine et diversis ducum sententiis agebat , Arminio sinerent egredi egressosque rursum per umida et inpedita circumvenirent suadente , atrociora Inguiomero et laeta barbaris , ut vallum armis ambirent$$ There was as much restlessness in the German host with its hopes ,  its eager longings ,  and the conflicting opinions of its chiefs Arminius advised that they should allow the Romans to quit their position ,  and ,  when they had quitted it ,  again surprise them in swampy and intricate ground
 promptam expugnationem , plures captivos , incorruptam praedam fore igitur orta die proruunt fossas , iniciunt cratis , summa valli prensant , raro super milite et quasi ob metum defixo$$ Inguiomerus ,  with fiercer counsels ,  heartily welcome to barbarians ,  was for beleaguering the entrenchment in armed array ,  as to storm them would ,  he said ,  be easy ,  and there would be more prisoners and the booty unspoilt
 postquam haesere munimentis , datur cohortibus signum cornuaque ac tubae concinuere$$ So at daybreak they trampled in the fosses ,  flung hurdles into them ,  seized the upper part of the breastwork ,  where the troops were thinly distributed and seemingly paralysed by fear
 exim clamore et impetu tergis Germanorum circumfunduntur , exprobrantes non hic silvas nec paludes , sed aequis locis aequos deos$$ When they were fairly within the fortifications ,  the signal was given to the cohorts ,  and the horns and trumpets sounded
 hosti facile excidium et paucos ac semermos cogitanti sonus tubarum , fulgor armorum , quanto inopina tanto maiora offunduntur , cadebantque , ut rebus secundis avidi , ita adversis incauti Arminius integer , Inguiomerus post grave vulnus pugnam deseruere vulgus trucidatum est , donec ira et dies permansit$$ Instantly ,  with a shout and sudden rush ,  our men threw themselves on the German rear ,  with taunts ,  that here were no woods or swamps ,  but that they were on equal ground ,  with equal chances The sound of trumpets ,  the gleam of arms ,  which were so unexpected ,  burst with all the greater effect on the enemy ,  thinking only ,  as they were ,  of the easy destruction of a few half-armed men ,  and they were struck down ,  as unprepared for a reverse as they had been elated by success
 nocte demum reversae legiones , quamvis plus vulnerum , eadem ciborum egestas fatigaret , vim sanitatem copias , cuncta in victoria habuere$$ Arminius and Inguiomerus fled from the battle ,  the first unhurt ,  the other severely wounded Their followers were slaughtered ,  as long as our fury and the light of day lasted
 Penaserat interim circumventi exercitus fama et infesto Germanorum agmine Gallias peti , ac ni Agrippina inpositum Rheno pontem solvi prohibuisset , erant qui id fiagitium formidine auderent$$ Meanwhile a rumour had spread that our army was cut off ,  and that a furious German host was marching on Gaul And had not Agrippina prevented the bridge over the Rhine from being destroyed ,  some in their cowardice would have dared that base act
 sed femina ingens animi munia ducis per eos dies induit , militibusque , ut quis inops aut saucius , vestem et fomenta dilargita est$$ A woman of heroic spirit ,  she assumed during those days the duties of a general ,  and distributed clothes or medicine among the soldiers ,  as they were destitute or wounded
 tradit Gaius Plinius Germanicorum bellorum scriptor , stetisse apud principium ponti laudes et grates reversis legionibus habentem$$ According to Caius Plinius ,  the historian of the German wars ,  she stood at the extremity of the bridge ,  and bestowed praise and thanks on the returning legions

 non tamen ideo faciebat fidem civilis animi nam legem maiestatis reduxerat , cui nomen apud veteres idem , sed alia in iudicium veniebant , si quis proditione exercitum aut plebem seditionibus , denique male gesta re publica maiestatem populi Romani minuisset$$ But he did not thereby create a belief in his patriotism ,  for he had revived the law of treason ,  the name of which indeed was known in ancient times ,  though other matters came under its jurisdiction ,  such as the betrayal of an army ,  or seditious stirring up of the people ,  or ,  in short ,  any corrupt act by which a man had impaired the majesty of the people of Rome
 facta arguebantur , dicta inpune erant$$ Deeds only were liable to accusation

 addidit Hispo statuam Marcelli altius quam Caesarum sitam , et alia in statua amputato capite Augusti effigiem Tiberii inditam$$ Hispo added that Marcellus had placed his own statue above those of the Caesars ,  and had set the bust of Tiberius on another statue from which he had struck off the head of Augustus

 centesimam rerum venalium post bella civilia institutam deprecante populo edixit Tiberius militare aerarium eo subsidio niti simul imparem oneri rem publicam , nisi vicesimo militiae anno veterani dimitterentur ita proximae seditionis male consulta , quibus sedecim stipendiorum finem expresserant , abolita in posterum$$ When the people of Rome asked for a remission of the one per cent tax on all saleable commodities ,  Tiberius declared by edict that the military exchequer depended on that branch of revenue ,  and ,  further ,  that the State was unequal to the burden ,  unless the twentieth year of service were to be that of the veteran's discharge Thus the ill-advised results of the late mutiny ,  by which a limit of sixteen campaigns had been extorted ,  were cancelled for the future
 Actum deinde in senatu ab Arruntio et Ateio an ob moderandas Tiberis exundationes verterentur flumina et lacus , per quos augescit$$ A question was then raised in the Senate by Arruntius and Ateius whether ,  in order to restrain the inundations of the Tiber ,  the rivers and lakes which swell its waters should be diverted from their courses

 speciosa verbis , re inania aut subdola , quantoque maiore libertatis imagine tegebantur , tanto eruptura ad infensius servitium$$ A plausible profession this in words ,  but really unmeaning and delusive ,  and the greater the disguise of freedom which marked it ,  the more cruel the enslavement into which it was soon to plunge us

 accendebat dedignantis et ipse diversus a maiorum institutis , raro venatu , segni equorum cura quotiens per urbes incederet , lecticae gestamine fastuque erga patrias epulas$$ Vonones himself too further provoked their disdain ,  by his contrast with their ancestral manners ,  by his rare indulgence in the chase ,  by his feeble interest in horses ,  by the litter in which he was carried whenever he made a progress through their cities ,  and by his contemptuous dislike of their national festivities

 nec Arminius aut ceteri Germanorum proceres omittebant suos quisque testari , hos esse Romanos Variani exercitus fugacissimos qui ne bellum tolerarent , seditionem induerint$$ Nor were Arminius and the other German chiefs slow to call their respective clansmen to witness that these Romans were the most cowardly fugitives out of Varus's army ,  men who rather than endure war had taken to mutiny
 quorum pars onustavulneribus terga , pars fluctibus et procellis fractos artus infensis rursum hostibus , adversis dis obiciant , nulla boni spe$$ Half of them have their backs covered with wounds half are once again exposing limbs battered by waves and storms to a foe full of fury ,  and to hostile deities ,  with no hope of advantage
 classem quippe et avia Oceani quaesita ne quis venientibus occurreret , ne pulsos premeret$$ They have ,  in fact ,  had recourse to a fleet and to a trackless ocean ,  that their coming might be unopposed ,  their flight unpursued

 meminissent modo avaritiae , crudelitatis , superbiae$$ Remember only their greed ,  their cruelty ,  their pride

 Sic accensos et proelium poscentis in campum , cui Idistaviso nomen , deducunt$$ When they were thus roused and were demanding battle ,  their chiefs led them down into a plain named Idistavisus
 is medius inter Visurgim et collis , ut ripae fluminis cedunt aut prominentia montium resistunt , inaequaliter sinuatur$$ It winds between the Visurgis and a hill range ,  its breadth varying as the river banks recede or the spurs of the hills project on it

 interea pulcherrimum augurium , octo aquilae petere silvas et intrare visae imperatorem advertere$$ Meanwhile there was a most encouraging augury Eight eagles ,  seen to fly towards the woods and to enter them ,  caught the general's eye
 exclamat irent , sequerentur Romanas avis , propria legionum numina$$ Go ,  he exclaimed ,  follow the Roman birds ,  the true deities of our legions
 simul pedestris acies infertur et praemissus eques postremos ac latera impulit$$ At the same moment the infantry charged ,  and the cavalry which had been sent on in advance dashed on the rear and the flanks
 mirumque dictu , duo hostium agmina diversa fuga , qui silvam tenuerant , in aperta , qui campis adstiterant , in silvam ruebant$$ And ,  strange to relate ,  two columns of the enemy fled in opposite directions ,  that ,  which had occupied the wood ,  rushing into the open ,  those who had been drawn up on the plains ,  into the wood
 medii inter hos Cherusci collibus detrudebantur , inter quos insignis Arminius manu voce vulnere sustentabat pugnam$$ The Cherusci ,  who were between them ,  were dislodged from the hills ,  while Arminius ,  conspicuous among them by gesture ,  voice ,  and a wound he had received ,  kept up the fight

 nisu tamen corporis et impetu equi pervasit , oblitus faciem suo curore ne nosceretur$$ By a strong bodily effort ,  however ,  and a furious rush of his horse ,  he made his way through them ,  having smeared his face with his blood ,  that he might not be known

 consilia locos , prompta occulta noverat astusque hostium in perniciem ipsis vertebat$$ He was acquainted with their plans ,  their positions ,  with what met the eye ,  and what was hidden ,  and he prepared to turn the enemy's stratagems to their own destruction
 Seio Tuberoni legato tradit equitem campumque$$ To Seius Tubero ,  his chief officer ,  he assigned the cavalry and the plain

 Nec minor Germanis animus , sed genere pugnae et armorum superabantur , cum ingens multitudo artis locis praelongas hastas non protenderet , non colligeret , neque adsultibus et velocitate corporum uteretur , coacta stabile ad proelium$$ The Germans were equally brave ,  but they were beaten by the nature of the fighting and of the weapons ,  for their vast host in so confined a space could neither thrust out nor recover their immense lances ,  or avail themselves of their nimble movements and lithe frames ,  forced as they were to a close engagement
 contra miles , cui scutum pecotri adpressum et insidens capulo manus , latos barbarorum artus , nuda ora foderet viamque strage hostium aperiret , inprompto iam Arminio ob continua pericula , sive illum recens acceptum vulnus tardaverat$$ Our soldiers ,  on the other hand ,  with their shields pressed to their breasts ,  and their hands grasping their sword-hilts ,  struck at the huge limbs and exposed faces of the barbarians ,  cutting a passage through the slaughtered enemy ,  for Arminius was now less active ,  either from incessant perils ,  or because he was partially disabled by his recent wound
 quin et Inguiomerum , tota volitantem acie , fortuna magis quam virtus deserebat$$ As for Inguiomerus ,  who flew hither and thither over the battlefield ,  it was fortune rather than courage which forsook him
 et Germanicus quo magis adgnosceretur detraxerat tegimen capitii orabatque insisterent caedibus nil opus captivis , solam internicionem gentis finem bello fore$$ Germanicus ,  too ,  that he might be the better known ,  took his helmet off his head and begged his men to follow up the slaughter ,  as they wanted not prisoners ,  and the utter destruction of the nation would be the only conclusion of the war
 iamque sero diei subducit ex acie legionem faciendis castris ceterae ad noctem cruore hostium satiatae sunt$$ And now ,  late in the day ,  he withdrew one of his legions from the field ,  to intrench a camp ,  while the rest till nightfall glutted themselves with the enemy's blood
 equites ambigue certavere$$ Our cavalry fought with indecisive success

 de se nihil addidit , metu invidiae an ratus conscientiam facti satis esse$$ He added nothing about himself ,  fearing jealousy ,  or thinking that the conciousness of the achievement was enough
 mox bellum in Angrivarios Stertinio mandat , ni deditionem properavissent$$ Next he charged Stertinius with making war on the Angrivarii ,  but they hastened to surrender
 atque illi supplices nihil abnuendo veniam omnium accepere$$ And ,  as suppliants ,  by refusing nothing ,  they obtained a full pardon

 ac primo placidum aequor mille navium remis strepere aut velis inpelli$$ At first the calm waters merely sounded with the oars of a thousand vessels or were ruffled by the sailing ships
 mox atro nubium globo effusa grando , simul variis undique procellis incerti fluctus prospectum adimere , regimen inpedire milesque pavidus et casuum maris ignarus dum turbat nautas vel intempestive iuvat , officia prudentium corrumpebat omne dehinc caelum et mare omne in austrum cessit , qui tumidis Germaniae terris , profundis amnibus , immenso nubium tractu validus et rigore vicini septentrionis horridior rapuit disiecitque navis in aperta Oceani aut insulas saxis abruptis vel per occulta vada infestas$$ Soon ,  a hailstorm bursting from a black mass of clouds ,  while the waves rolled hither and thither under tempestuous gales from every quarter ,  rendered clear sight impossible ,  and the steering difficult ,  while our soldiers ,  terrorstricken and without any experience of disasters on the sea ,  by embarrassing the sailors or giving them clumsy aid ,  neutralized the services of the skilled crews After a while ,  wind and wave shifted wholly to the south ,  and from the hilly lands and deep rivers of Germany came with a huge line of rolling clouds ,  a strong blast ,  all the more frightful from the frozen north which was so near to them ,  and instantly caught and drove the ships hither and thither into the open ocean ,  or on islands with steep cliffs or which hidden shoals made perilous
 quibus paulum aegreque vitatis , postquam mutabat aestus eodemque quo ventus ferebat , non adhaerere ancoris , non exhaurire inrumpentis undas poterant$$ these they just escaped ,  with difficulty ,  and when the tide changed and bore them the same way as the wind ,  they could not hold to their anchors or bale out the water which rushed in upon them
 equi , iumenta , sarcinae , etiam arma praecipitantur quo levarentur alvei manantes per latera et fluctu superurgente$$ Horses ,  beasts of burden ,  baggage ,  were thrown overboard ,  in order to lighten the hulls which leaked copiously through their sides ,  while the waves too dashed over them
 Quanto violentior cetero mari Oceanus et truculentia caeli praestat Germania , tantum illa clades novitate et magnitudine excessit , hostilibus circum litoribus aut ita vasto et profundo ut credatur novissimum ac sine terris mare$$ As the ocean is stormier than all other seas ,  and as Germany is conspicuous for the terrors of its climate ,  so in novelty and extent did this disaster transcend every other ,  for all around were hostile coasts ,  or an expanse so vast and deep that it is thought to be the remotest shoreless sea
 pars navium haustae sunt , plures apud insulas longius sitas eiectae$$ Some of the vessels were swallowed up
 milesque nullo illic hominum cultu fame absumptus , nisi quos corpora equorum eodem elisa toleraverant$$ many were wrecked on distant islands ,  and the soldiers ,  finding there no form of human life ,  perished of hunger ,  except some who supported existence on carcases of horses washed on the same shores
 sola Germanici triremis Chaucorum terram adpulit$$ Germanicus's trireme alone reached the country of the Chauci
 quem per omnis illos dies noctesque apud scopulos et prominentis oras , cum se tanti exitii reum clamitaret , vix cohibuere amici quo minus eodem mari oppeteret$$ Day and night ,  on those rocks and promontories he would incessantly exclaim that he was himself responsible for this awful ruin ,  and friends scarce restrained him from seeking death in the same sea
 tandem relabente aestu et secundante vento claudae naves raro remigio aut intentis vestibus , et quaedam a validioribus tractae , revertere$$ At last ,  as the tide ebbed and the wind blew favourably ,  the shattered vessels with but few rowers ,  or clothing spread as sails ,  some towed by the more powerful ,  returned ,  and Germanicus ,  having speedily repaired them ,  sent them to search the islands

 Sed fama classis amissae ut Germanos ad spem belli , ita Caesarem ad coercendum erexit$$ Meanwhile the rumoured loss of the fleet stirred the Germans to hope for war ,  as it did Caesar to hold them down
 Gaius Silio cum triginta peditum , tribus equitum milibus ire in Chattos imperat$$ He ordered Caius Silius with thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry to march against the Chatti
 ipse maioribus copiis Marsos inrumpit , quorum dux Mallovendus nuper in deditionem acceptus propinquo luco defossam Varianae legionis aquilam modico praesidio servari indicat$$ He himself ,  with a larger army ,  invaded the Marsi ,  whose leader ,  Mallovendus ,  whom we had lately admitted to surrender ,  pointed out a neighbouring wood ,  where ,  he said ,  an eagle of one of Varus's legions was buried and guarded only by a small force
 missa extemplo manus quae hostem a fronte eliceret , alii qui terga circumgressi recluderent humum$$ Immediately troops were despatched to draw the enemy from his position by appearing in his front ,  others ,  to hem in his rear and open the ground
 et utrisque adfuit fortuna$$ Fortune favoured both
 eo promptior Caesar pergit introrsus , populatur , excindit non ausum congredi hostem aut , sicubi restiterat , statim pulsum nec umquam magis , ut ex captivis cognitum est , paventem$$ So Germanicus ,  with increased energy ,  advanced into the country ,  laying it waste ,  and utterly ruining a foe who dared not encounter him ,  or who was instantly defeated wherever he resisted ,  and ,  as we learnt from prisoners ,  was never more panic-stricken
 quippe invictos et nullis casibas superabilis Romanos praedicabant , qui perdita classe , amissis armis , post constrata equorum virorumque corporibus litora eadem virtute , pari ferocia et velut aucti numero inrupissent$$ The Romans ,  they declared ,  were invincible ,  rising superior to all calamities for having thrown away a fleet ,  having lost their arms ,  after strewing the shores with the carcases of horses and of men ,  they had rushed to the attack with the same courage ,  with equal spirit ,  and ,  seemingly ,  with augmented numbers
 Vt satis testium et qui servi eadem noscerent repperit , aditum ad principem postulat , demonstrato crimine et reo per Flaccum Vescularium equitem Romanum , cui propior cum Tiberio usus erat$$ As soon as he found enough witnesses ,  with some slaves who knew the facts ,  he begged an audience of the emperor ,  after first indicating the crime and the criminal through Flaccus Vescularius ,  a Roman knight ,  who was more intimate with Tiberius than himself
 Caesar indicium haud aspernatus congressus abnuit posse enim eodem Flacco internuntio sermones commeare$$ Caesar ,  without disregarding the information ,  declined an interview ,  for the communication ,  he said ,  might be conveyed to him through the same messenger ,  Flaccus
 atque interim Libonem ornat praetura , convictibus adhibet , non vultu alienatus , non verbis commotior (adeo iram condiderat)$$ Meanwhile he conferred the praetorship on Libo and often invited him to his table ,  showing no unfriendliness in his looks or anger in his words (so thoroughly had he concealed his resentment)
 cunctaque eius dicta factaque , cum prohibere posset , scire malebat , donec Iunius quidam , temptatus ut infernas umbras carminibus eliceret , ad Fulcinium Trionem indicium detulit$$ and he wished to know all his saying and doings ,  though it was in his power to stop them ,  till one Junius ,  who had been tampered with by Libo for the purpose of evoking by incantations spirits of the dead ,  gave information to Fulcinius Trio
 celebre inter accusatores Trionis ingenium erat avidumque famae malae$$ Trio's ability was conspicuous among informers ,  as well as his eagerness for an evil notoriety

 die senatus metu et aegritudine fessus , sive , ut tradidere quidam , simulato morbo , lectica delatus ad foris curiae innisusque fratri et manus ac supplices voces ad Tiberium tendens immoto eius vultu excipitur$$ On the day the Senate met ,  jaded with fear and mental anguish ,  or ,  as some have related ,  feigning illness ,  he was carried in a litter to the doors of the Senate House ,  and leaning on his brother he raised his hands and voice in supplication to Tiberius ,  who received him with unmoved countenance
 mox libellos et auctores recitat Caesar ita moderans ne lenire neve asperare crimina videretur$$ The emperor then read out the charges and the accusers' names ,  with such calmness as not to seem to soften or aggravate the accusations
 Accesserant praeter Trionem et Catum accusatores Fonteius Agrippa et Gaius Vibius , certabantque cui ius perorandi in reum daretur , donec Vibius , quia nec ipsi inter se concederent et Libo sine patrono introisset , singillatim se crimina obiecturum professus , protulit libellos vaecordes adeo ut consultaverit Libo an habiturus foret opes quis viam Appiam Brundisium usque pecunia operiret$$ Besides Trio and Catus ,  Fonteius Agrippa and Caius Vibius were among his accusers ,  and claimed with eager rivalry the privilege of conducting the case for the prosecution ,  till Vibius ,  as they would not yield one to the other ,  and Libo had entered without counsel ,  offered to state the charges against him singly ,  and produced an extravagantly absurd accusation ,  according to which Libo had consulted persons whether he would have such wealth as to be able to cover the Appian road as far as Brundisium with money
 inerant et alia huiusce modi stolida vana , si mollius acciperes , misemuda$$ There were other questions of the same sort ,  quite senseless and idle
 uni tamen libello manu Libonis nominibus Caesarum aut senatorum additas atrocis vel occultas notas accusator arguebat$$ if leniently regarded ,  pitiable But there was one paper in Libo's handwriting ,  so the prosecutor alleged ,  with the names of Caesars and of Senators ,  to which marks were affixed of dreadful or mysterious significance

 ob quae posterum diem reus petivit domumque digressus extremas preces Publius Quirinio propinquo suo ad principem mandavit$$ As a consequence ,  the defendant asked an adjournment till next day ,  and having gone home he charged his kinsman ,  Publius Quirinus ,  with his last prayer to the emperor
 Responsum est ut senatum rogaret$$ The answer was that he should address himself to the Senate

 atque illis , dum trepidant , dum refugiunt , evertentibus adpositum cum mensa lumen , feralibus iam sibi tenebris duos ictus in viscera derexit$$ In their confusion ,  as they shrank back ,  they overturned the lamp on the table at his side ,  and in the darkness ,  now to him the gloom of death ,  he aimed two blows at a vital part

 haud minus liberi doloris documentum idem Piso mox dedit vocata in ius Vrgulania , quam supra leges amicitia Augustae extulerat$$ Soon afterwards this same Piso gave an equal proof of a fearless sense of wrong by suing Urgulania ,  whom Augusta's friendship had raised above the law
 nec aut Vrgulania optemperavit , in domum Caesaris spreto Pisone vecta , aut ille abscessit , quamquam Augusta se violari et imminui quereretur$$ Neither did Urgulania obey the summons ,  for in defiance of Piso she went in her litter to the emperor's house
 Tiberius hactenus indulgere matri civile ratus , ut se iturum ad praetoris tribunal , adfuturum Vrgulaniae diceret , processit Palatio , procul sequi iussis militibus$$ nor did Piso give way ,  though Augusta complained that she was insulted and her majesty slighted Tiberius ,  to win popularity by so humouring his mother as to say that he would go to the praetor's court and support Urgulania ,  went forth from the palace ,  having ordered soldiers to follow him at a distance
 spectabatur occursante populo compositus ore et sermonibus variis tempus atque iter ducens , donec propinquis Pisonem frustra coercentibus deferri Augusta pecuniam quae petebatur iuberet$$ He was seen ,  as the people thronged about him ,  to wear a calm face ,  while he prolonged his time on the way with various conversations ,  till at last when Piso's relatives tried in vain to restrain him ,  Augusta directed the money which was claimed to be handed to him
 isque finis rei , ex qua neque Piso inglorius et Caesar maiore fama fuit$$ This ended the affair ,  and Piso ,  in consequence ,  was not dishonoured ,  and the emperor rose in reputation
 ceterum Vrgulaniae potentia adeo nimia civitati erat ut testis in causa quadam , quae apud senatum tractabatur , venire dedignaretur$$ Urgulania's influence ,  however ,  was so formidable to the State ,  that in a certain cause which was tried by the Senate she would not condescend to appear as a witness
 missus est praetor qui domi interrogaret , cum virgines Vestales in foro et iudicio audiri , quotiens testimonium dicerent , vetus mos fuerit$$ The praetor was sent to question her at her own house ,  although the Vestal virgins ,  according to ancient custom ,  were heard in the courts ,  before judges ,  whenever they gave evidence
 Res eo anno prolatas haud referrem , ni pretium foret Gnaeus Pisonis et Asinii Galli super eo negotio diversas sententias noscere$$ I should say nothing of the adjournment of public business in this year ,  if it were not worth while to notice the conflicting opinions of Cneius Piso and Asinius Gallus on the subject
 Piso , quamquam afuturum se dixerat Caesar , ob id magis agendas censebat , ut absente principe senatum et equites posse sua munia sustinere decorum rei publicae foret$$ Piso ,  although the emperor had said that he would be absent ,  held that all the more ought the business to be transacted ,  that the State might have honour of its Senate and knights being able to perform their duties in the sovereign's absence
 Gallus , quia speciem libertatis Piso praeceperat , nihil satis inlustre aut ex dignitate populi Romani nisi coram et sub oculis Caesaris , eoque conventum Italiae et adfluentis provincias praesentiae eius servanda dicebat$$ Gallus ,  as Piso had forestalled him in the display of freedom ,  maintained that nothing was sufficiently impressive or suitable to the majesty of the Roman people ,  unless done before Caesar and under his very eyes ,  and that therefore the gathering from all Italy and the influx from the provinces ought to be reserved for his presence
 audiente haec Tiberio ac silente magnis utrimque contentionibus acta , sed res dilatae$$ Tiberius listened to this in silence ,  and the matter was debated on both sides in a sharp controversy
 Et certamen Gallo adversus Caesarem exortum est$$ A dispute then arose between Gallus and the emperor
 nam censuit in quinquennium magistratuum comitia habenda , utque legionum legati , qui ante praeturam ea militia fungebantur , iam tum praetores destinarentur , princeps duodecim candidatos in annos singulos nominaret$$ Gallus proposed that the elections of magistrates should be held every five years ,  and that the commanders of the legions who before receiving a praetorship discharged this military service should at once become praetorselect ,  the emperor nominating twelve candidates every year
 haud dubium erat eam sententiam altius penetrare et arcana imperii temptari$$ It was quite evident that this motion had a deeper meaning and was an attempt to explore the secrets of imperial policy
 Tiberius tamen , quasi augeretur potestas eius , disseruit$$ Tiberius ,  however ,  argued as if his power would be thus increased
 grave moderationi suae tot eligere , tot differre$$ It would ,  he said ,  be trying to his moderation to have to elect so many and to put off so many
 vix per singulos annos offensiones vitari , quamvis repulsam propinqua spes soletur$$ He scarcely avoided giving offence from year to year ,  even though a candidate's rejection was solaced by the near prospect of office
 quantum odii fore ab iis qui ultra quinquennium proiciantur unde prospici posse quae cuique tam longo temporis spatio mens , domus , fortuna$$ What hatred would be incurred from those whose election was deferred for five years! How could he foresee through so long an interval what would be a man's temper ,  or domestic relations ,  or estate
 superbire homines etiam annua designatione$$ Men became arrogant even with this annual appointment
 quid si honorem per quinquennium agitent$$ What would happen if their thoughts were fixed on promotion for five years
 quinquiplicari prorsus magistratus , subverti leges , quae sua spatia exercendae candidatorum industriae quaerendisque aut potiundis honoribus statuerint$$ It was in fact a multiplying of the magistrates five-fold ,  and a subversion of the laws which had prescribed proper periods for the exercise of the candidate's activity and the seeking or securing office
 favorabili in speciem oratione vim imperii tenuit$$ With this seemingly conciliatory speech he retained the substance of power
 Inclinatio senatus incitamentum Tiberio fuit quo promptius adversaretur , his ferme verbis usus$$ The Senate's favourable bias was an incitement to Tiberius to offer prompt opposition ,  which he did in nearly these words 
 si quantum pauperum est venire huc et liberis suis petere pecunias coeperint , singuli numquam exsatiabuntur , res publica deficiet$$  , If all poor men begin to come here and to beg money for their children ,  individuals will never be satisfied ,  and the State will be bankrupt
 nec sane ideo a maioribus concessum est egredi aliquando relationem et quod in commune conducat loco sententiae proferre , ut privata negotia et res familiaris nostras hic augeamus , cum invidia senatus et principum , sive indulserint largitionem sive abnuerint$$ Certainly our ancestors did not grant the privilege of occasionally proposing amendments or of suggesting ,  in our turn for speaking ,  something for the general advantage in order that we might in this house increase our private business and property ,  thereby bringing odium on the Senate and on emperors whether they concede or refuse their bounty
 non enim preces sunt istud , sed efflagitatio , intempestiva quidem et inprovisa , cum aliis de rebus convenerint patres , consurgere et numero atque aetate liberum suorum urgere modestiam senatus , eandem vim in me transmittere ac velut perfringere aerarium , quod si ambitione exhauserimus , per scelera supplendum erit$$ In fact ,  it is not a request ,  but an importunity ,  as utterly unreasonable as it is unforeseen ,  for a senator ,  when the house has met on other matters ,  to rise from his place and ,  pleading the number and age of his children ,  put a pressure on the delicacy of the Senate ,  then transfer the same constraint to myself ,  and ,  as it were ,  break open the exchequer ,  which ,  if we exhaust it by improper favouritism ,  will have to be replenished by crimes
 dedit tibi , Hortale , divus Augustus pecuniam , sed non conpellatus nec en lege ut semper daretur$$ Money was given you ,  Hortalus ,  by Augustus ,  but without solicitation ,  and not on the condition of its being always given
 languescet alioqui industria , intendetur socordia , si nullus ex se metus aut spes , et securi omnes aliena subsidia expectabunt , sibi ignavi , nobis graves$$ Otherwise industry will languish and idleness be encouraged ,  if a man has nothing to fear ,  nothing to hope from himself ,  and every one ,  in utter recklessness ,  will expect relief from others ,  thus becoming useless to himself and a burden to me
 haec atque talia , quamquam cum adsensu audita ab iis quibus omnia principum , honesta atque inhonesta , laudare mos est , plures per silentium aut occultum murmur excepere$$ These and like remarks ,  though listened to with assent by those who make it a practice to eulogise everything coming from sovereigns ,  both good and bad ,  were received by the majority in silence or with suppressed murmurs
 sensitque Tiberius et cum paulum reticuisset , Hortalo se respondisse ait ceterum si patribus videretur , daturum liberis eius ducena sestertia singulis , qui sexus virilis essent$$ Tiberius perceived it ,  and having paused a while ,  said that he had given Hortalus his answer ,  but that if the senators thought it right ,  he would bestow two hundred thousand sesterces on each of his children of the male sex
 egere alii grates$$ The others thanked him
 siluit Hortalus , pavore an avitae nobilitatis etiam inter angustias fortunae retinens$$ Hortalus said nothing ,  either from alarm or because even in his reduced fortunes he clung to his hereditary nobility
 neque miseratus est posthac Tiberius , quamvis domus Hortensii pudendam ad inopiam delaberetur$$ Nor did Tiberius afterwards show any pity ,  though the house of Hortensius sank into shameful poverty
 Vulgabatur interim per Italiam servatum munere deum Agrippam , credebatur Romae$$ It was rumoured meanwhile throughout Italy ,  and was believed at Rome ,  that Agrippa had been saved by the blessing of Heaven
 iamque Ostiam invectum multitudo ingens , iam in urbe clandestini coetus celebrabant , cum Tiberium anceps cura distrahere , vine militum servum suum coerceret an inanem credulitatem tempore ipso vanescere sineret$$ Already at Ostia ,  where he had arrived ,  he was the centre of interest to a vast concourse as well as to secret gatherings in the capital ,  while Tiberius was distracted by the doubt whether he should crush this slave of his by military force or allow time to dissipate a silly credulity
 modo nihil spernendum , modo non omnia metuenda ambiguus pudoris ac metus reputabat$$ Sometimes he thought that he must overlook nothing ,  sometimes that he need not be afraid of everything ,  his mind fluctuating between shame and terror
 postremo dat negotium Sallustio Crispo ille e clientibus duos (quidam milites fuisse tradunt) deligit atque hortatur , simulata conscientia adeant , offerant pecuniam , fidem atque pericula polliceantur$$ At last he entrusted the affair to Sallustius Crispus ,  who chose two of his dependants (some say they were soldiers) and urged them to go to him as pretended accomplices ,  offering money and promising faithful companionship in danger
 exequuntur ut iussum erat$$ They did as they were bidden
 dein speculati noctem incustoditam , accepta idonea manu , vinctum clauso ore in Palatium traxere$$ then ,  waiting for an unguarded hour of night ,  they took with them a sufficient force ,  and having bound and gagged him ,  dragged him to the palace
 percontanti Tiberio quo modo Agrippa factus esset respondisse fertur quo modo tu Caesar$$ When Tiberius asked him how he had become Agrippa ,  he is said to have replied ,  As you became Caesar
 ut ederet socios subigi non potuit$$ He could not be forced to divulge his accomplices
 nec Tiberius poenam eius palam ausus , in secreta Palatii parte interfici iussit corpusque clam auferri$$ Tiberius did not venture on a public execution ,  but ordered him to be slain in a private part of the palace and his body to be secretly removed
 et quamquam multi e domo principis equitesque ac senatores sustentasse opibus , iuvisse consiliis dicerentur , haud quaesitum$$ And although many of the emperor's household and knights and senators were said to have supported him with their wealth and helped him with their counsels ,  no inquiry was made
 Fine anni arcus propter aedem Saturni ob recepta signa cum Varo amissa ductu Germanici , auspiciis Tiberii , et aedes Fortis Fortunae Tiberim iuxta in hortis , quos Caesar dictator populo Romano legaverat , sacrarium genti Iuliae effigiesque divo Augusto apud Bovillas dicantur$$ At the close of the year was consecrated an arch near the temple of Saturn to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost with Varus ,  under the leadership of Germanicus and the auspices of Tiberius a temple of Fors Fortuna ,  by the Tiber ,  in the gardens which Caesar ,  the dictator ,  bequeathed to the Roman people a chapel to the Julian family ,  and statues at Bovillae to the Divine Augustus

 vecta spolia , captivi , simulacra montium , fluminum , proeliorum$$ There were borne in procession spoils ,  prisoners ,  representations of the mountains ,  the rivers and battles
 bellumque , quia conficere prohibitus erat , pro confecto accipiebatur$$ and the war ,  seeing that he had been forbidden to finish it ,  was taken as finished

 sed suberat occulta formido , reputantibus haud prosperum in Druso patre eius favorem vulgi , avunculum eiusdem Marcellum flagrantibus plebis studiis intra inventam ereptum , brevis et infaustos populi Romani amores$$ Still ,  there was a latent dread when they remembered how unfortunate in the case of Drusus ,  his father ,  had been the favour of the crowd how his uncle Marcellus ,  regarded by the city populace with passionate enthusiasm ,  had been snatched from them while yet a youth ,  and how short-lived and ill-starred were the attachments of the Roman people
 Ceterum Tiberius nomine Germanici trecenos plebi sestertios viritim dedit seque collegam consulatui eius destinavit$$ Tiberius meanwhile in the name of Germanicus gave every one of the city populace three hundred sesterces ,  and nominated himself his colleague in the consulship
 nec ideo sincerae caritatis fidem adsecutus amoliri iuvenem specie honoris statuit struxitque causas aut forte oblatas arripuit$$ Still ,  failing to obtain credit for sincere affection ,  he resolved to get the young prince out of the way ,  under pretence of conferring distinction ,  and for this he invented reasons ,  or eagerly fastened on such as chance presented
 rex Archelaus quinquagesimum annum Cappadocia potiebatur , invisus Tiberio quod eum Rhodi agentem nullo officio coluisset$$ King Archelaus had been in possession of Cappadocia for fifty years ,  and Tiberius hated him because he had not shown him any mark of respect while he was at Rhodes
 nec id Archelaus per superbiam omiserat , sed ab intimis Augusti monitus , quia florente Gaio Caesare missoque ad res Orientis intuta Tiberii amicitia credebatur$$ This neglect of Archelaus was not due to pride ,  but was suggested by the intimate friends of Augustus ,  because ,  when Caius Caesar was in his prime and had charge of the affairs of the East ,  Tiberius's friendship was thought to be dangerous
 ut versa Caesarum subole imperium adeptus est , elicit Archelaum matris litteris , quae non dissimulatis filii offensionibus clementiam offerebae , si ad precandum veniret$$ When ,  after the extinction of the family of the Caesars ,  Tiberius acquired the empire ,  he enticed Archelaus by a letter from his mother ,  who without concealing her son's displeasure promised mercy if he would come to beg for it

 sed praeter patemos spiritus uxoris quoque Plancinae nobilitate et opibus accendebatur$$ But beside the father's haughty temper there was also the noble rank and wealth of his wife Plancina ,  to inflame his ambition
 vix Tiberio concedere , liberos eius ut multum infra despectare$$ He would hardly be the inferior of Tiberius ,  and as for Tiberius's children ,  he looked down on them as far beneath him
 nec dubium habebat se delectum qui Syriae imponeretur ad spes Germanici coercendas$$ He thought it a certainty that he had been chosen to govern Syria in order to thwart the aspirations of Germanicus
 credidere quidam data et a Tiberio occulta mandata et Plancinam haud dubie Augusta monuit aemulatione muliebri Agrippinam insectandi divisa namque et discors aula erat tacitis in Drusum aut Germanicum studiis$$ Some believed that he had even received secret instructions from Tiberius ,  and it was beyond a question that Augusta ,  with feminine jealousy ,  had suggested to Plancina calumnious insinuations against Agrippina
 Tiberius ut proprium et sui sanguinis Drusum fovebat$$ For there was division and discord in the court ,  with unexpressed partialities towards either Drusus or Germanicus
 Germanico alienatio patrui amorem apud ceteros auxerat , et quia claritudine matemi generis anteibat , avum Marcus Antonium , avunculum Augustum ferens contra Druso proavus eques Romanus Pomponius Atticus dedecere Claudiorum imagines videbatur$$ Tiberius favoured Drusus ,  as his son and born of his own blood As for Germanicus ,  his uncle's estrangement had increased the affection which all others felt for him ,  and there was the fact too that he had an advantage in the illustrious rank of his mother's family ,  among whom he could point to his grandfather Marcus Antonius and to his great-uncle Augustus
 et coniunx Germanici Agrippina fecunditate ac fama Liviam uxorem Drusi praecellebat$$ Drusus ,  on the other hand ,  had for his great-grandfather a Roman knight ,  Pomponius Atticus ,  who seemed to disgrace the ancestral images of the Claudii

 at se duodecim legionibus petitum duce Tiberio inlibatam Germanorum gloriam servavisse , mox condicionibus aequis discessum$$ As for himself ,  he had been attacked by twelve legions led by Tiberius ,  and had preserved untarnished the glory of the Germans ,  and then on equal terms the armies had parted
 neque paenitere quod ipsorum in manu sit , integrum adversum Romanos bellum an pacem incruentam malint$$ He was by no means sorry that they had the matter in their own hands ,  whether they preferred to war with all their might against Rome ,  or to accept a bloodless peace
 his vocibus instinctos exercitus propriae quoque causae stimulabant , cum a Cheruscis Langobardisque pro antiquo decore aut recenti libertate et contra augendae dominationi certaretur$$ To these words ,  which roused the two armies ,  was added the stimulus of special motives of their own The Cherusci and Langobardi were fighting for ancient renown or newly-won freedom

 Magnetes a Sipylo proximi damno ac remedio habiti$$ Magnesia ,  under Mount Sipylus ,  was considered to come next in loss and in need of help
 Temnios , Philadelphenos , Aegeatas , Apollonidenses , quique Mosteni aut Macedones Hyrcani vocantur , et Hierocaesariam , Myrinam , Cymen , Tmolum levari idem in tempus tributis mittique ex senatu placuit , qui praesentia spectaret refoveretque$$ The people of Temnus ,  Philadelpheia ,  Aegae ,  Apollonis ,  the Mostenians ,  and Hyrcanian Macedonians ,  as they were called ,  with the towns of Hierocaesarea ,  Myrina ,  Cyme ,  and Tmolus ,  were it was decided ,  to be exempted from tribute for the same time ,  and some one was to be sent from the Senate to examine their actual condition and to relieve them
 delectus est Marcus Ateius e praetoriis , ne consulari obtinente Asiam aemulatio inter pares et ex eo impedimentum oreretur$$ Marcus Aletus ,  one of the expraetors ,  was chosen ,  from a fear that ,  as an exconsul was governor of Asia ,  there might be rivalry between men of equal rank ,  and consequent embarrassment

 neque dubitabantur praescripta ei a Tiberio , cum incallidus alioqui et facilis iuventa senilibus tum artibus uteretur$$ Men did not doubt that his answer prescribed him by Tiberius ,  inasmuch as one who had generally all the simplicity and candour of youth ,  now had recourse to the artifices of old age

 veraque aut in deterius credita indice ab uno facilius discerni , odium et invidiam apud multos valere$$ Truth too would be more easily distinguished from perverse misrepresentation by a single judge ,  where a number would be swayed by hatred and ill-will
 haud fallebat Tiberium moles cognitionis quaque ipse fama distraheretur$$ Tiberius was not unaware of the formidable difficulty of the inquiry and of the rumours by which he was himself assailed
 igitur paucis familiarium adhibitis minas accusantium et hinc preces audit integramque causam ad senatum remittit$$ Having therefore summoned a few intimate friends ,  he listened to the threatening speeches of the prosecutors and to the pleadings of the accused ,  and finally referred the whole case to the Senate
 Atque interim Drusus rediens Illyrico , quamquam patres censuissent ob receptum Maroboduum et res priore aestate gestas ut ovans iniret , prolato honore urbem intravit$$ Drusus meanwhile ,  on his return from Illyricum ,  though the Senate had voted him an ovation for the submission of Maroboduus and the successes of the previous summer ,  postponed the honour and entered Rome
 post quae reo Lucius Arruntium , Publius Vinicium , Asinium Gallum , Aeserninum Marcellum , Sex Pompeium patronos petenti iisque diversa excusantibus M Lepidus et Lucius Piso et Livineius Regulus adfuere , arrecta omni civitate , quanta fides amicis Germanici , quae fiducia reo satin cohiberet ac premeret sensus suos Tiberius$$ Then the defendant sought the advocacy of Lucius Arruntius ,  Marcus Vinicius ,  Asinius Gallus ,  Aeserninus Marcellus and Sextus Pompeius ,  and on their declining for different reasons ,  Marcus Lepidus ,  Lucius Piso ,  and Livineius Regulus became his counsel ,  amid the excitement of the whole country ,  which wondered how much fidelity would be shown by the friends of Germanicus ,  on what the accused rested his hopes ,  and how far Tiberius would repress and hide his feelings
 haud alias intentior populus plus sibi in principem occultae vocis aut suspicacis silentii permisit$$ Never were the people more keenly interested never did they indulge themselves more freely in secret whispers against the emperor or in the silence of suspicion
 Die senatus Caesar orationem habuit meditato temperamento$$ On the day the Senate met ,  Tiberius delivered a speech of studied moderation
 patris sui legatum atque amicum Pisonem fuisse adiutoremque Germanico datum a se auctore senatu rebus apud Orientem administrandis$$ Piso ,  he said ,  was my father's representative and friend ,  and was appointed by myself ,  on the advice of the Senate ,  to assist Germanicus in the administration of the East
 illic contumacia et certaminibus asperasset iuvenem exituque eius laetatus esset an scelere extinxisset , integris animis diiudicandum$$ Whether he there had provoked the young prince by wilful opposition and rivalry ,  and had rejoiced at his death or wickedly destroyed him ,  is for you to determine with minds unbiassed
 nam si legatus officii terminos , obsequium erga imperatorem exuit eiusdemque morte et luctu meo laetatus est , odero seponamque a domo mea et privatas inimicitias non vi principis ulciscar$$ Certainly if a subordinate oversteps the bounds of duty and of obedience to his commander ,  and has exulted in his death and in my affliction ,  I shall hate him and exclude him from my house ,  and I shall avenge a personal quarrel without resorting to my power as emperor
 sin facinus in cuiuscumque mortalium nece vindicandum detegitur , vos vero et liberos Germanici et nos parentes iustis solaciis adficite$$ If however a crime is discovered which ought to be punished ,  whoever the murdered man may be ,  it is for you to give just reparation both to the children of Germanicus and to us ,  his parents
 simulque illud reputate , turbide et seditiose tractaverit exercitus Piso , quaesita sint per ambitionem studia militum , armis repetita provincia , an falsa haec in maius vulgaverint accusatores , quorum ego nimiis studiis iure suscenseo$$ Consider this too ,  whether Piso dealt with the armies in a revolutionary and seditious spirit whether he sought by intrigue popularity with the soldiers whether he attempted to repossess himself of the province by arms ,  or whether these are falsehoods which his accusers have published with exaggeration
 nam quo pertinuit nudare corpus et contrectandum vulgi oculis permittere differrique etiam per externos tamquam veneno interceptus esset , si incerta adhuc ista et scrutanda sunt$$ As for them ,  I am justly angry with their intemperate zeal For to what purpose did they strip the corpse and expose it to the pollution of the vulgar gaze ,  and circulate a story among foreigners that he was destroyed by poison ,  if all this is still doubtful and requires investigation
 defleo equidem filium meum semperque deflebo$$ For my part ,  I sorrow for my son and shall always sorrow for him
 sed neque reum prohibeo quo minus cuncta proferat , quibus innocentia eius sublevari aut , si qua fuit iniquitas Germanici , coargui possit , vosque oro ne , quia dolori meo causa conexa est , obiecta crimina pro adprobatis accipiatis$$ still I would not hinder the accused from producing all the evidence which can relieve his innocence or convict Germanicus of any unfairness ,  if such there was And I implore you not to take as proven charges alleged ,  merely because the case is intimately bound up with my affliction
 si quos propinquus sanguis aut fides sua patronos dedit , quantum quisque eloquentia et cura valet , iuvate periclitantem$$ Do you ,  whom ties of blood or your own true-heartedness have made his advocates ,  help him in his peril ,  every one of you ,  as far as each man's eloquence and diligence can do so
 ad eundem laborem , eandem constantiam accusatores hortor$$ To like exertions and like persistency I would urge the prosecutors
 id solum Germanico super leges praestiterimus , quod in curia potius quam in foro , apud senatum quam apud iudices de morte eius anquiritur$$ In this ,  and in this only ,  will we place Germanicus above the laws ,  by conducting the inquiry into his death in this house instead of in the forum ,  and before the Senate instead of before a bench of judges
 cetera pari modestia tractentur$$ In all else let the case be tried as simply as others
 nemo Drusi lacrimas , nemo maestitiam meam spectet , nec si qua in nos adversa finguntur$$ Let no one heed the tears of Drusus or my own sorrow ,  or any stories invented to our discredit
 Exim biduum criminibus obiciendis statuitur utque sex dierum spatio interiecto reus per triduum defenderetur$$ Two days were then assigned for the bringing forward of the charges ,  and after six days' interval ,  the prisoner's defence was to occupy three days
 tum Fulcinius vetera et inania orditur , ambitiose avareque habitam Hispaniam$$ Thereupon Fulcinius Trio began with some old and irrelevant accusations about intrigues and extortion during Piso's government of Spain
 quod neque convictum noxae reo si recentia purgaret , neque defensum absolutioni erat si teneretur maioribus flagitiis$$ This ,  if proved ,  would not have been fatal to the defendant ,  if he cleared himself as to his late conduct ,  and ,  if refuted ,  would not have secured his acquittal ,  if he were convicted of the greater crimes
 post quem Servaeus et Veranius et Vitellius consimili studio et multa eloquentia Vitellius obiecere odio Germanici et rerum novarum studio Pisonem vulgus militum per licentiam et sociorum iniurias eo usque conrupisse ut parens legionum a deterrimis appellaretur contra in optimum quemque , maxime in comites et amicos Germanici saevisse$$ Next ,  Servaeus ,  Veranius ,  and Vitellius ,  all with equal earnestness ,  Vitellius with striking eloquence ,  alleged against Piso that out of hatred of Germanicus and a desire of revolution he had so corrupted the common soldiers by licence and oppression of the allies that he was called by the vilest of them father of the legions while on the other hand to all the best men ,  especially to the companions and friends of Germanicus ,  he had been savagely cruel
 postremo ipsum devotionibus et veneno peremisse sacra hinc et immolationes nefandas ipsius atque Plancinae , peritam armis rem publicam , utque reus agi posset , acie victum$$ Lastly ,  he had ,  they said ,  destroyed Germanicus himself by sorceries and poison ,  and hence came those ceremonies and horrible sacrifices made by himself and Plancina then he had threatened the State with war ,  and had been defeated in battle ,  before he could be tried as a prisoner
 Defensio in ceteris trepidavit$$ On all points but one the defence broke down
 nam neque ambitionem militarem neque provinciam pessimo cuique obnoxiam , ne contumelias quidem adversum imperatorem infitiari poterat$$ That he had tampered with the soldiers ,  that his province had been at the mercy of the vilest of them ,  that he had even insulted his chief ,  he could not deny
 solum veneni crimen visus est diluisse , quod ne accusatores quidem satis firmabant , in convivio Germanici , cum super eum Piso discumberet , infectos manibus eius cibos arguentes$$ It was only the charge of poisoning from which he seemed to have cleared himself This indeed the prosecutors did not adequately sustain by merely alleging that at a banquet given by Germanicus ,  his food had been tainted with poison by the hands of Piso who sat next above him
 quippe absurdum videbatur inter aliena servitia et tot adstantium visu , ipso Germanico coram , id ausum$$ It seemed absurd to suppose that he would have dared such an attempt among strange servants ,  in the sight of so many bystanders ,  and under Germanicus's own eyes
 offerebatque familiam reus et ministros in tormenta flagitabat$$ And ,  besides ,  the defendant offered his slaves to the torture ,  and insisted on its application to the attendants on that occasion
 sed iudices per diversa implacabiles erant , Caesar ob bellum provinciae inlatum , senatus numquam satis credito sine fraude Germanicum interisse$$ But the judges for different reasons were merciless ,  the emperor ,  because war had been made on a province ,  the Senate because they could not be sufficiently convinced that there had been no treachery about the death of Germanicus
 * * scripsissent expostulantes , quod haud minus Tiberius quam Piso abnuere$$ At the same time shouts were heard from the people in front of the Senate House ,  threatening violence if he escaped the verdict of the Senators
 simul populi ante curiam voces audiebantur non temperaturos manibus si patrum sententias evasisset$$ They had actually dragged Piso's statues to the Gemonian stairs ,  and were breaking them in pieces ,  when by the emperor's order they were rescued and replaced
 effigiesque Pisonis traxerant in Gemonias ac divellebant , ni iussu principis protectae repositaeque forent$$ Piso was then put in a litter and attended by a tribune of one of the Praetorian cohorts ,  who followed him ,  so it was variously rumoured ,  to guard his person or to be his executioner
 Eadem Plancinae invidia , maior gratia$$ Plancina was equally detested ,  but had stronger interest
 eoque ambiguum habebatur quantum Caesari in eam liceret$$ Consequently it was considered a question how far the emperor would be allowed to go against her
 atque ipsa , donec mediae Pisoni spes , sociam se cuiuscumque fortunae et si ita ferret comitem exitii promittebat$$ While Piso's hopes were in suspense ,  she offered to share his lot ,  whatever it might be ,  and in the worst event ,  to be his companion in death
 ut secretis Augustae precibus veniam obtinuit , paulatim segregari a marito , dividere defensionem coepit$$ But as soon as she had secured her pardon through the secret intercessions of Augusta ,  she gradually withdrew from her husband and separated her defence from his
 quod reus postquam sibi exitiabile intellegit , an adhuc experiretur dubitans , hortantibus filiis durat mentem senatumque rursum ingreditur$$ When the prisoner saw that this was fatal to him ,  he hesitated whether he should still persist ,  but at the urgent request of his sons braced his courage and once more entered the Senate
 redintegratamque accusationem , infensas patrum voces , adversa et saeva cuncta perpessus , nullo magis exterritus est quam quod Tiberium sine miseratione , sine ira , obstinatum clausumque vidit , ne quo adfectu perrumperetur$$ There he bore patiently the renewal of the accusation ,  the furious voices of the Senators ,  savage opposition indeed from every quarter ,  but nothing daunted him so much as to see Tiberius ,  without pity and without anger ,  resolutely closing himself against any inroad of emotion
 relatus domum , tamquam defensionem in posterum meditaretur , pauca conscribit obsignatque et liberto tradit$$ He was conveyed back to his house ,  where ,  seemingly by way of preparing his defence for the next day ,  he wrote a few words ,  sealed the paper and handed it to a freedman
 tum solita curando corpori exequitur$$ Then he bestowed the usual attention on his person
 dein multam post noctem , egressa cubiculo uxore , operiri foris iussit et coepta luce perfosso iugulo , iacente humi gladio , repertus est$$ after a while ,  late at night ,  his wife having left his chamber ,  he ordered the doors to be closed ,  and at daybreak was found with his throat cut and a sword lying on the ground
 Audire me memini ex senioribus visum saepius inter manus Pisonis libellum quem ipse non vulgaverit sed amicos eius dictitavisse , litteras Tiberii et mandata in Germanicum contineri , ac destinatum promere apud patres principemque arguere , ni elusus a Seiano per vana promissa foret$$ I remember to have heard old men say that a document was often seen in Piso's hands ,  the substance of which he never himself divulged ,  but which his friends repeatedly declared contained a letter from Tiberius with instructions referring to Germanicus ,  and that it was his intention to produce it before the Senate and upbraid the emperor ,  had he not been deluded by vain promises from Sejanus
 nec illum sponte extinctum verum immisso percussore$$ Nor did he perish ,  they said ,  by his own hand ,  but by that of one sent to be his executioner
 quorum neutrum adseveraverim$$ Neither of these statements would I positively affirm
 neque tamen occulere debui narratum ab iis qui nostram ad iuventam duraverunt$$ still it would not have been right for me to conceal what was related by those who lived up to the time of my youth
 Caesar flexo in maestitiam ore suam invidiam tali morte quaesitam apud senatum      crebrisque interrogationibus exquirit qualem Piso diem supremum noctemque exegisset$$ The emperor ,  assuming an air of sadness ,  complained in the Senate that the purpose of such a death was to bring odium on himself ,  and he asked with repeated questionings how Piso had spent his last day and night
 atque illo pleraque sapienter quaedam inconsultius respondente , recitat codicillos a Pisone in hunc ferme modum compositos$$ Receiving answers which were mostly judicious ,  though in part somewhat incautious ,  he read out a note written by Piso ,  nearly to the following effect 
 conspiratione inimicorum et invidia falsi criminis oppressus , quatenus veritati et innocentiae meae nusquam locus est , deos inmortalis testor vixisse me , Caesar , cum fide adversum te neque alia in matrem tuam pietate$$ Crushed by a conspiracy of my foes and the odium excited by a lying charge ,  since my truth and innocence find no place here ,  I call the immortal gods to witness that towards you Caesar ,  I have lived loyally ,  and with like dutiful respect towards your mother
 vosque oro liberis meis consulatis , ex quibus Gnaeus Piso qualicumque fortunae meae non est adiunctus , cum omne hoc tempus in urbe egerit , Marcus Piso repetere Syriam dehortatus est$$ And I implore you to think of my children ,  one of whom ,  Cneius is in way implicated in my career ,  whatever it may have been ,  seeing that all this time he has been at Rome ,  while the other ,  Marcus Piso ,  dissuaded me from returning to Syria
 atque utinam ego potius filio iuveni quam ille patri seni cessisset$$ Would that I had yielded to my young son rather than he to his aged father! And therefore I pray the more earnestly that the innocent may not pay the penalty of my wickedness
 eo impensius precor ne meae pravitatis poenas innoxius luat per quinque et quadraginta annorum obsequium , per collegium consulatus quondam divo Augusto parenti tuo probatus et tibi amicus nec quicquam post haec rogaturus salutem infelicis filii rogo$$ By forty-five years of obedience ,  by my association with you in the consulate ,  as one who formerly won the esteem of the Divine Augustus ,  your father ,  as one who is your friend and will never hereafter ask a favour ,  I implore you to save my unhappy son
 de Plancina nihil addidit$$ About Plancina he added not a word
 Eodem anno Tacfarinas , quem priore aestate pulsum a Camillo memoravi , bellum in Africa renovat , vagis primum populationibus et ob pernicitatem inultis , dein vicos excindere , trahere gravis praedas$$ That same year Tacfarinas who had been defeated ,  as I have related ,  by Camillus in the previous summer ,  renewed hostilities in Africa ,  first by mere desultory raids ,  so swift as to be unpunished next ,  by destroying villages and carrying off plunder wholesale
 postremo haud procul Pagyda flumine cohortem Romanam circumsedit$$ Finally ,  he hemmed in a Roman cohort near the river Pagyda
 praeerat castello Decrius impiger manu , exercitus militia et illam obsidionem flagitii ratus$$ The position was commanded by Decrius ,  a soldier energetic in action and experienced in war ,  who regarded the siege as a disgrace
 is cohortatus milites , ut copiam pugnae in aperto faceret aciem pro castris instruit$$ Cheering on his men to offer battle in the open plain ,  he drew up his line in front of his intrenchments
 primoque impetu pulsa cohorte promptus inter tela occursat fugientibus , increpat signiferos quod inconditis aut desertoribus miles Romanus terga daret$$ At the first shock ,  the cohort was driven back ,  upon which he threw himself fearlessly amid the missiles in the path of the fugitives and cried shame on the standard-bearers for letting Roman soldiers show their backs to a rabble of deserters
 simul exceptat vulnera et quamquam transfosso oculo adversum os in hostem intendit neque proelium omisit donec desertus suis caderet$$ At the same moment he was covered with wounds ,  and though pierced through the eye ,  he resolutely faced the enemy and ceased not to fight till he fell deserted by his men
 Quae postquam Lucius Apronio (nam Camillo successerat) comperta , magis dedecore suorum quam gloria hostis anxius , raro ea tempestate et e vetere memoria facinore decumum quemque ignominiosae cohortis sorte ductos fusti necat$$ On receiving this information ,  Lucius Apronius ,  successor to Camillus ,  alarmed more by the dishonour of his own men than by the glory of the enemy ,  ventured on a deed quite exceptional at that time and derived from old tradition
 tantumque severitate profectum ut vexillum veteranorum , non amplius quingenti numero , easdem Tacfarinatis copias praesidium cui Thala nomen adgressas fuderint$$ He flogged to death every tenth man drawn by lot from the disgraced cohort So beneficial was this rigour that a detachment of veterans ,  numbering not more than five hundred ,  routed those same troops of Tacfarinas on their attacking a fortress named Thala
 quo proelio Rufus Helvius gregarius miles servati civis decus rettulit donatusque est ab Apronio torquibus et hasta$$ In this engagement Rufus Helvius ,  a common soldier ,  won the honour of saving a citizen's life ,  and was rewarded by Apronius with a neck-chain and a spear
 Caesar addidit civicam coronam , quod non eam quoque Apronius iure proconsulis tribuisset questus magis quam offensus$$ To these the emperor added the civic crown ,  complaining ,  but without anger ,  that Apronius had not used his right as proconsul to bestow this further distinction
 sed Tacfarinas perculsis Numidis et obsidia aspernantibus spargit bellum , ubi instaretur cedens ac rursum in terga remeans$$ Tacfarinas ,  however ,  finding that the Numidians were cowed and had a horror of siege-operations ,  pursued a desultory warfare ,  retreating when he was pressed ,  and then again hanging on his enemy's rear
 et dum ea ratio barbaro fuit , inritum fessumque Romanum impune ludificabatur$$ While the barbarian continued these tactics ,  he could safely insult the baffled and exhausted Romans
 postquam deflexit ad maritimos locos , inligatus praeda stativis castris adhaerebat , missu patris Apronius Caesianus cum equite et cohortibus auxiliariis , quis velocissimos legionum addiderat , prosperam adversum Numidas pugnam facit pellitque in deserta$$ But when he marched away towards the coast and ,  hampered with booty ,  fixed himself in a regular camp ,  Caesianus was despatched by his father Apronius with some cavalry and auxiliary infantry ,  reinforced by the most active of the legionaries ,  and ,  after a successful battle with the Numidians ,  drove them into the desert
 Inlustrium domuum adversa (etenim haud multum distanti tempore Calpurnii Pisonem , Aemilii Lepidam amiserant) solacio adfecit D$$ It was some compensation for the misfortunes of great houses (for within a short interval the Calpurnii had lost Piso and the Aemilii Lepida) that Decimus Silanus was now restored to the Junian family
 Silanus Iuniae familiae redditus$$ I will briefly relate his downfall
 casum eius paucis repetam ut valida divo Augusto in rem publicam fortuna ita domi improspera fuit ob impudicitiam filiae ac neptis quas urbe depulit , adulterosque earum morte aut fuga punivit$$ Though the Divine Augustus in his public life enjoyed unshaken prosperity ,  he was unfortunate at home from the profligacy of his daughter and granddaughter ,  both of whom he banished from Rome ,  and punished their paramours with death or exile
 nam culpam inter viros ac feminas vulgatam gravi nomine laesarum religionum ac violatae maiestatis appellando clementiam maiorum suasque ipse leges egrediebatur$$ Calling ,  as he did ,  a vice so habitual among men and women by the awful name of sacrilege and treason ,  he went far beyond the indulgent spirit of our ancestors ,  beyond indeed his own legislation
 sed aliorum exitus simul cetera illius aetatis memorabo si effectis in quae tetendi plures ad curas vitam produxero$$ But I will relate the deaths of others with the remaining events of that time ,  if after finishing the work I have now proposed to myself ,  I prolong my life for further labours
 D Silanus in nepti Augusti adulter , quamquam non ultra foret saevitum quam ut amicitia Caesaris Tiberio imperitante deprecari senatum ac principem ausus est Marcus Silani fratris potentia , qui per insignem nobilitatem et eloquentiam praecellebat$$ Decimus Silanus ,  the paramour of the granddaughter of Augustus ,  though the only severity he experienced was exclusion from the emperor's friendship ,  saw clearly that it meant exile and it was not till Tiberius's reign that he ventured to appeal to the Senate and to the prince ,  in reliance on the influence of his brother Marcus Silanus ,  who was conspicuous both for his distinguished rank and eloquence
 sed Tiberius gratis agenti Silano patribus coram respondit se quoque laetari quod frater eius e peregrinatione longinqua revertisset , idque iure licitum quia non senatus consulto non lege pulsus foret$$ But Tiberius ,  when Silanus thanked him ,  replied in the Senate's presence ,  that he too rejoiced at the brother's return from his long foreign tour ,  and that this was justly allowable ,  inasmuch as he had been banished not by a decree of the Senate or under any law
 sibi tamen adversus eum integras parentis sui offensiones neque reditu Silani dissoluta quae Augustus voluisset$$ Still ,  personally ,  he said ,  he felt towards him his father's resentment in all its force ,  and the return of Silanus had not cancelled the intentions of Augustus
 fuit posthac in urbe eque honores adeptus est$$ Silanus after this lived at Rome without attaining office
 Relatum dein de moderanda Papia Poppaea , quam senior Augustus post Iulias rogationes incitandis caelibum poenis et augendo aerario sanxerat$$ It was next proposed to relax the Papia Poppaea law ,  which Augustus in his old age had passed subsequently to the Julian statutes ,  for yet further enforcing the penalties on celibacy and for enriching the exchequer
 nec ideo coniugia et educationes liberum frequentabantur praevalida orbitate$$ And yet ,  marriages and the rearing of children did not become more frequent ,  so powerful were the attractions of a childless state
 ceterum multitudo periclitantium gliscebat , cum omnis domus delatorum interpretationibus subverteretur , utque antehac flagitiis ita tunc legibus laborabatur$$ Meanwhile there was an increase in the number of persons imperilled ,  for every household was undermined by the insinuations of informers and now the country suffered from its laws ,  as it had hitherto suffered from its vices
 ea res admonet ut de principiis iuris et quibus modis ad hanc multitudinem infinitam ac varietatem legum perventum sit altius disseram$$ This suggests to me a fuller discussion of the origin of law and of the methods by which we have arrived at the present endless multiplicity and variety of our statutes
 Vetustissimi mortalium , nulla adhuc mala libidine , sine probro , scelere eoque sine poena aut coercitionibus agebant$$ Mankind in the earliest age lived for a time without a single vicious impulse ,  without shame or guilt ,  and ,  consequently ,  without punishment and restraints
 neque praemiis opus erat cum honesta suopte ingenio peterentur$$ Rewards were not needed when everything right was pursued on its own merits
 et ubi nihil contra morem cuperent , nihil per metum vetabantur$$ and as men desired nothing against morality ,  they were debarred from nothing by fear
 at postquam exui aequalitas et pro modestia ac pudore ambitio et vis incedebat , provenere dominationes multosque apud populos aeternum mansere$$ When however they began to throw off equality ,  and ambition and violence usurped the place of self-control and modesty ,  despotisms grew up and became perpetual among many nations
 quidam statim aut postquam regum pertaesum leges maluerunt$$ Some from the beginning ,  or when tired of kings ,  preferred codes of laws
 hae primo rudibus hominum animis simplices erant$$ These were at first simple ,  while men's minds were unsophisticated
 maximeque fama celebravit Cretensium , quas Minos , Spartanorum , quas Lycurgus , ac mox Atheniensibus quaesitiores iam et plures Solo perscripsit$$ The most famous of them were those of the Cretans ,  framed by Minos those of the Spartans ,  by Lycurgus ,  and ,  subsequently ,  those which Solan drew up for the Athenians on a more elaborate and extensive scale
 nobis Romulus ut libitum imperitaverat$$ Romulus governed us as he pleased
 dein Numa religionibus et divino iure populum devinxit , repertaque quaedam a Tullo et Anco$$ then Numa united our people by religious ties and a constitution of divine origin ,  to which some additions were made by Tullus and Ancus
 sed praecipuus Servius Tullius sanctor legum fuit quis etiam reges obtemperarent$$ But Servius Tullius was our chief legislator ,  to whose laws even kings were to be subject
 Pulso Tarquinio adversum patrum factiones multa populus paravit tuendae libertatis et firmandae concordiae , creatique decemviri et accitis quae usquam egregia compositae duodecim tabulae , finis aequi iuris$$ After Tarquin's expulsion ,  the people ,  to check cabals among the Senators ,  devised many safeguards for freedom and for the establishment of unity Decemvirs were appointed everything specially admirable elsewhere was adopted ,  and the Twelve Tables drawn up ,  the last specimen of equitable legislation
 nam secutae leges etsi aliquando in maleficos ex delicto , saepius tamen dissensione ordinum et apiscendi inlicitos honores aut pellendi claros viros aliaque ob prava per vim latae sunt$$ For subsequent enactments ,  though occasionally directed against evildoers for some crime ,  were oftener carried by violence amid class dissensions ,  with a view to obtain honours not as yet conceded ,  or to banish distinguished citizens ,  or for other base ends
 hinc Gracchi et Saturnini turbatores plebis nec minor largitor nomine senatus Drusus$$ Hence the Gracchi and Saturnini ,  those popular agitators ,  and Drusus too ,  as flagrant a corrupter in the Senate's name
 corrupti spe aut inlusi per intercessionem socii$$ hence ,  the bribing of our allies by alluring promises and the cheating them by tribunes vetoes
 ac ne bello quidem Italico , mox civili omissum quin multa et diversa sciscerentur , donec Lucius Sulla dictator abolitis vel conversis prioribus , cum plura addidisset , otium eius rei haud in longum paravit , statim turbidis Lepidi rogationibus neque multo post tribunis reddita licentia quoquo vellent populum agitandi$$ Even the Italian and then the Civil war did not pass without the enactment of many conflicting laws ,  till Lucius Sulla ,  the Dictator ,  by the repeal or alteration of past legislation and by many additions ,  gave us a brief lull in this process ,  to be instantly followed by the seditious proposals of Lepidus ,  and soon afterwards by the tribunes recovering their license to excite the people just as they chose
 iamque non modo in commune sed in singulos homines latae quaestiones , et corruptissima re publica plurimae leges$$ And now bills were passed ,  not only for national objects but for individual cases ,  and laws were most numerous when the commonwealth was most corrupt
 Tum Gnaeus Pompeius , tertium consul corrigendis moribus delectus et gravior remediis quam delicta erant suarumque legum auctor idem ac subversor , quae armis tuebatur armis amisit$$ Cneius Pompeius was then for the third time elected consul to reform public morals ,  but in applying remedies more terrible than the evils and repealing the legislation of which he had himself been the author ,  he lost by arms what by arms he had been maintaining
 exim continua per viginti annos discordia , non mos , non ius$$ Then followed twenty years of continuous strife
 deterrima quaeque impune ac multa honesta exitio fuere$$ custom or law there was none
 sexto demum consulatu Caesar Augustus , potentiae securus , quae triumviratu iusserat abolevit deditque iura quis pace et principe uteremur acriora ex eo vincla , inditi custodes et lege Papia Poppaea praemiis inducti ut , si a privilegiis parentum cessaretur , velut parens omnium populus vacantia teneret sed altius penetrabnat urbemque et Italiam et quod usquam civium corripuerant , multorumque excisi status$$ the vilest deeds went unpunished ,  while many noble acts brought ruin At last ,  in his sixth consulship ,  Caesar Augustus ,  feeling his power secure ,  annulled the decrees of his triumvirate ,  and gave us a constitution which might serve us in peace under a monarchy Henceforth our chains became more galling ,  and spies were set over us ,  stimulated by rewards under the Papia Poppaea law ,  so that if men shrank from the privileges of fatherhood ,  the State ,  as universal parent ,  might possess their ownerless properties
 et terror omnibus intentabatur ni Tiberius statuendo remedio quinque consularium , quinque e praetoriis , totidem e cetero senatu sorte duxisset apud quos exsoluti plerique legis nexus modicum in praesens levamentum fuere$$ But this espionage became too searching ,  and Rome and Italy and Roman citizens everywhere fell into its clutches Many men's fortunes were ruined ,  and over all there hung a terror till Tiberius ,  to provide a remedy ,  selected by lot five ex-consuls ,  five ex-praetors ,  and five senators ,  by whom most of the legal knots were disentangled and some light temporary relief afforded
 Per idem tempus Neronem e liberis Germanici iam ingressum iuventam commendavit patribus , utque munere capessendi vigintiviratus solveretur et quinquennio maturius quam per leges quaesturam peteret non sine inrisu audientium postulavit$$ About this same time he commended to the Senate's favour ,  Nero ,  Germanicus's son ,  who was just entering on manhood ,  and asked them ,  not without smiles of ridicule from his audience ,  to exempt him from serving as one of the Twenty Commissioners ,  and let him be a candidate for quaestorship five years earlier than the law allowed
 praetendebat sibi atque fratri decreta eadem petente Augusto$$ His excuse was that a similar decree had been made for himself and his brother at the request of Augustus
 sed neque tum fuisse dubitaverim qui eius modi preces occulti inluderent ac tamen initia fastigii Caesaribus erant magisque in oculis vetus mos , et privignis cum vitrico levior necessitudo quam avo adversum nepotem$$ But I cannot doubt that even then there were some who secretly laughed at such a petition ,  though the Caesars were but in the beginning of their grandeur ,  and ancient usage was more constantly before men's eyes ,  while also the tie between stepfather and stepson was weaker than that between grandfather and grandchild

 id Tiberius solitis sibi ambagibus apud senatum incusavit , cum extolleret pietatem quamvis modicas principis iniurias acriter ulciscentium , deprecare tam praecipitis verborum poenas , laudaret Lepidum neque Agrippam argueret$$ Of this Tiberius complained to the Senate with his usual ambiguity ,  extolling their loyalty in so sharply avenging the very slightest insults to the sovereign ,  though he deprecated such hasty punishment of mere words ,  praising Lepidus and not censuring Agrippa
 igitur factum senatus consultum ne decreta patrum ante diem decimum ad aerarium deferrentur idque vitae spatium damnatis prorogaretur$$ So the Senate passed a resolution that their decrees should not be registered in the treasury till nine days had expired ,  and so much respite was to be given to condemned persons
 sed non senatui libertas ad paenitendum erat neque Tiberius interiectu temporis mitigabatur$$ Still the Senate had not liberty to alter their purpose ,  and lapse of time never softened Tiberius
 Gaius Sulpicius D$$ Caius Sulpicius and Didius Haterius were the next consuls
 Haterius consules sequuntur , inturbidus externis rebus annus , domi suspecta severitate adversum luxum qui immensum proruperat ad cuncta quis pecunia prodigitur$$ It was a year free from commotions abroad ,  while at home stringent legislation was apprehended against the luxury which had reached boundless excess in everything on which wealth is lavished
 sed alia sumptuum quamvis graviora dissimulatis plerumque pretiis occultabantur$$ Some expenses ,  though very serious ,  were generally kept secret by a concealment of the real prices
 ventris et ganeae paratus adsiduis sermonibus vulgati fecerant curam ne princeps antiquae parsimoniae durius adverteret$$ but the costly preparations for gluttony and dissipation were the theme of incessant talk ,  and had suggested a fear that a prince who clung to oldfashioned frugality would be too stern in his reforms
 nam incipiente Gaius Bibulo ceteri quoque aediles disseruerant , sperni sumptuariam legem vetitaque utensilium pretia augeri in dies nec mediocribus remediis sisti posse , et consulti patres integrum id negotium ad principem distulerant$$ In fact ,  when the aedile Caius Bibulus broached the topic ,  all his colleagues had pointed out that the sumptuary laws were disregarded ,  that prohibited prices for household articles were every day on the increase ,  and that moderate measures could not stop the evil
 sed Tiberius saepe apud se pensitato an coerceri tam profusae cupidines possent , num coercitio plus damni in rem publicam ferret , quam indecorum adtrectare quod non obtineret vel retentum ignominiam et infamiam virorum inlustrium posceret , postremo litteras ad senatum composuit quarum sententia in hunc modum fuit$$ The Senate on being consulted had ,  without handling the matter ,  referred it to the emperor Tiberius ,  after long considering whether such reckless tastes could be repressed ,  whether the repression of them would not be still more hurtful to the State ,  also ,  how undignified it would be to meddle with what he could not succeed in ,  or what ,  if effected ,  would necessitate the disgrace and infamy of men of distinction ,  at last addressed a letter to the Senate to the following purport 
 Ceteris forsitan in rebus , patres conscripti , magis expediat me coram interrogari et dicere quid e re publica censeam$$ Perhaps in any other matter ,  Senators ,  it would be more convenient that I should be consulted in your presence ,  and then state what I think to be for the public good
 in hac relatione subtrahi oculos meos melius fuit , ne , denotantibus vobis ora ac metum singulorum qui pudendi luxus arguerentur , ipse etiam viderem eos ac velut deprenderem$$ In this debate it was better that my eyes should not be on you ,  for while you were noting the anxious faces of individual senators charged with shameful luxury ,  I too myself might observe them and ,  as it were ,  detect them
 quod si mecum ante viri strenui , aediles , consilium habuissent , nescio an suasurus fuerim omittere potius praevalida et adulta vitia quam hoc adsequi , ut palam fieret quibus flagitiis impares essemus$$ Had those energetic men ,  our aediles ,  first taken counsel with me ,  I do not know whether I should not have advised them to let alone vices so strong and so matured ,  rather than merely attain the result of publishing what are the corruptions with which we cannot cope
 sed illi quidem officio functi sunt , ut ceteros quoque magistratus sua munia implere velim$$ They however have certainly done their duty ,  as I would wish all other officials likewise to fulfil their parts
 mihi autem neque honestum silere neque proloqui expeditum , quia non aedilis aut praetoris aut consulis partis sustineo$$ For myself ,  it is neither seemly to keep silence nor is it easy to speak my mind ,  as I do not hold the office of aedile ,  praetor ,  or consul
 maius aliquid et excelsius a principe postulatur et cum recte factorum sibi quisque gratiam trahant , unius invidia ab omnibus peccatur$$ Something greater and loftier is expected of a prince ,  and while everybody takes to himself the credit of right policy ,  one alone has to bear the odium of every person's failures
 quid enim primum prohibere et priscum ad morem recidere adgrediar$$ For what am I first to begin with restraining and cutting down to the old standard
 villarumne infinita spatia$$ The vast dimensions of country houses
 familiarum numerum et nationes$$ The number of slaves of every nationality
 argenti et auri pondus$$ The masses of silver and gold
 aeris tabularumque miracula$$ The marvels in bronze and painting
 promiscas viris et feminis vestis atque illa feminarum propria , quis lapidum causa pecuniae nostrae ad externas aut hostilis gentis transferuntur$$ The apparel worn indiscriminately by both sexes ,  or that peculiar luxury of women which ,  for the sake of jewels ,  diverts our wealth to strange or hostile nations
 Nec ignoro in conviviis et circulis incusari ista et modum posci$$ I am not unaware that people at entertainments and social gatherings condemn all this and demand some restriction
 set si quis legem sanciat , poenas indicat , idem illi civitatem verti , splendidissimo cuique exitium parari , neminem criminis expertem clamitabunt$$ But if a law were to be passed and a penalty imposed ,  those very same persons will cry out that the State is revolutionised ,  that ruin is plotted against all our most brilliant fashion ,  that not a citizen is safe from incrimination
 atqui ne corporis quidem morbos veteres et diu auctos nisi per dura et aspera coerceas corruptus simul et corruptor , aeger et flagrans animus haud levioribus remediis restinguendus est quam libidinibus ardescit$$ Yet as even bodily disorders of long standing and growth can be checked only by sharp and painful treatment ,  so the fever of a diseased mind ,  itself polluted and a pollution to others ,  can be quenched only by remedies as strong as the passions which inflame it
 tot a maioribus repertae leges , tot quas divus Augustus tulit , illae oblivione , hae , quod flagitiosius est , contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere$$ Of the many laws devised by our ancestors ,  of the many passed by the Divine Augustus ,  the first have been forgotten ,  while his (all the more to our disgrace) have become obsolete through contempt ,  and this has made luxury bolder than ever
 nam si velis quod nondum vetitum est , timeas ne vetere$$ The truth is ,  that when one craves something not yet forbidden ,  there is a fear that it may be forbidden
 at si prohibita impune transcenderis , neque metus ultra neque pudor est$$ but when people once transgress prohibitions with impunity ,  there is no longer any fear or any shame
 cur ergo olim parsimonia pollebat$$ Why then in old times was economy in the ascendant
 quia sibi quisque moderabatur , quia unius urbis cives eramus$$ Because every one practised self-control
 ne inritamenta quidem eadem intra Italiam dominantibus$$ because we were all members of one city
 externis victoriis aliena , civilibus etiam nostra consumere didicimus$$ Nor even afterwards had we the same temptations ,  while our dominion was confined to Italy
 quantulum istud est de quo aediles admonent! quam , si cetera respicias , in levi habendum! at hercule nemo refert quod Italia externae opis indiget , quod vita populi Romani per incerta maris et tempestatum cotidie volvitur$$ Victories over the foreigner taught us how to waste the substance of others victories over ourselves ,  how to squander our own What a paltry matter is this of which the aediles are reminding us! What a mere trifle if you look at everything else! No one represents to the Senate that Italy requires supplies from abroad ,  and that the very existence of the people of Rome is daily at the mercy of uncertain waves and storms
 ac nisi provinciarum copiae et dominis et servitiis et agris subvenerint , nostra nos scilicet nemora nostraeque villae tuebuntur$$ And unless masters ,  slaves ,  and estates have the resources of the provinces as their mainstay ,  our shrubberies ,  forsooth ,  and our country houses will have to support us
 hanc , patres conscripti , curam sustinet princeps$$ Such ,  Senators ,  are the anxieties which the prince has to sustain ,  and the neglect of them will be utter ruin to the State
 haec omissa funditus rem publicam trahet$$ The cure for other evils must be sought in our own hearts
 reliquis intra animum medendum est$$ Let us be led to amendment ,  the poor by constraint ,  the rich by satiety
 nos pudor , pauperes necessitas , divites satias in melius mutet$$ Or if any of our officials give promise of such energy and strictness as can stem the corruption ,  I praise the man ,  and I confess that I am relieved of a portion of my burdens
 aut si quis ex magistratibus tantam industriam ac severitatem pollicetur ut ire obviam queat , hunc ego et laudo et exonerari laborum meorum partem fateor sin accusare vitia volunt , dein , cum gloriam eius rei adepti sunt , simultates faciunt ac mihi relinquunt , credite , patres conscripti , me quoque non esse offensionum avidum$$ But if they wish to denounce vice ,  and when they have gained credit for so doing they arouse resentments and leave them to me ,  be assured ,  Senators ,  that I too am by no means eager to incur enmities ,  and though for the public good I encounter formidable and often unjust enmities ,  yet I have a right to decline such as are unmeaning and purposeless and will be of use neither to myself nor to you
 Auditis Caesaris litteris remissa aedilibus talis cura luxusque mensae a fine Actiaci belli ad ea arma quis Servius Galba rerum adeptus est per annos centum profusis sumptibus exerciti paulatim exolevere$$ When they had heard the emperor's letter ,  the aediles were excused from so anxious a task ,  and that luxury of the table which from the close of the war ended at Actium to the armed revolution in which Servius Galba rose to empire ,  had been practised with profuse expenditure ,  gradually went out of fashion
 causas eius mutationis quaerere libet$$ It is as well that I should trace the causes of this change
 dites olim familiae nobilium aut claritudine insignes studio magnificentiae prolabebantur$$ Formerly rich or highly distinguished noble families often sank into ruin from a passion for splendour
 nam etiam tum plebem socios regna colere et coli licitum ut quisque opibus domo paratu speciosus per nomen et clientelas inlustrior habebatur postquam caedibus saevitum et magnitudo famae exitio erat , ceteri ad sapientiora convertere$$ Even then men were still at liberty to court and be courted by the city populace ,  by our allies and by foreign princes ,  and every one who from his wealth ,  his mansion and his establishment was conspicuously grand ,  gained too proportionate lustre by his name and his numerous clientele
 simul novi homines e municipiis et coloniis atque etiam provinciis in senatum crebro adsumpti domesticam parsimoniam intulerunt , et quamquam fortuna vel industria plerique pecuniosam ad senectam pervenirent , mansit tamen prior animus$$ After the savage massacres in which greatness of renown was fatal ,  the survivors turned to wiser ways The new men who were often admitted into the Senate from the towns ,  colonies and even the provinces ,  introduced their household thrift ,  and though many of them by good luck or energy attained an old age of wealth ,  still their former tastes remained
 sed praecipuus adstricti moris auctor Vespasianus fuit , antiquo ipse cultu victuque$$ But the chief encourager of strict manners was Vespasian ,  himself old-fashioned both in his dress and diet
 obsequium inde in principem et aemulandi amor validior quam poena ex legibus et metus$$ Henceforth a respectful feeling towards the prince and a love of emulation proved more efficacious than legal penalties or terrors
 nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis , ut quem ad modum temporum vices ita morum vertantur$$ Or possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle ,  and there may be moral revolutions just as there are changes of seasons
 nec omnia apud priores meliora , sed nostra quoque aetas multa laudis et artium imitanda posteris tulit$$ Nor was everything better in the past ,  but our own age too has produced many specimens of excellence and culture for posterity to imitate
 verum haec nobis in maiores certamina ex honesto maneant$$ May we still keep up with our ancestors a rivalry in all that is honourable!
 Inter quae provincia Africa Iunio Blaeso prorogata , Servius Maluginensis flamen Dialis ut Asiam sorte haberet postulavit , frustra vulgatum dictitans non licere Dialibus egredi Italia neque aliud ius suum quam Martialium Quirinaliumque flaminum$$ Meantime Junius Blaesus received an extension of his government of Africa ,  and Servius Maluginensis ,  the priest of Jupiter ,  demanded to have Asia allotted to him It was ,  he asserted ,  a popular error that it was not lawful for the priests of Jupiter to leave Italy in fact ,  his own legal position differed not from that of the priests of Mars and of Quirinus
 porro , si hi duxissent provincias , cur Dialibus id vetitum$$ If these latter had provinces allotted to them ,  why was it forbidden to the priests of Jupiter
 nulla de eo populi scita , non in libris caerimoniarum reperiri$$ There were no resolutions of the people or anything to be found in the books of ceremonies on the subject
 saepe pontifices Dialia sacra fecisse si flamen valetudine aut munere publico impediretur$$ Pontiffs had often performed the rites to Jupiter when his priest was hindered by illness or by public duty
 quinque et septuaginta annis post Cornelii Merulae caedem neminem suffectum neque tamen cessavisse religiones$$ For seventy-five years after the suicide of Cornelius Merula no successor to his office had been appointed
 quod si per tot annos possit non creari nullo sacrorum damno , quanto facilius afuturum ad unius anni proconsulare imperium$$ yet religious rites had not ceased If during so many years it was possible for there to be no appointment without any prejudice to religion ,  with what comparative ease might he be absent for one year's proconsulate
 privatis olim simultatibus effectum ut a pontificibus maximis ire in provincias prohiberentur$$ That these priests in former days were prohibited by the pontiff from going into the provinces ,  was the result of private feuds
 nunc deum munere summum pontificum etiam summum hominum esse , non aemulationi , non odio aut privatis adfectionibus obnoxium$$ Now ,  thank heaven ,  the supreme pontiff was also the supreme man ,  and was influenced by no rivalry ,  hatred or personal feeling
 Adversus quae cum augur Lentulus aliique varie dissererent , eo decursum est ut pontificis maximi sententiam opperirentur$$ As the augur Lentulus and others argued on various grounds against this view ,  the result was that they awaited the decision of the supreme pontiff
 Tiberius dilata notione de iure flaminis decretas ob tribuniciam Drusi potestatem caerimonias temperavit , nominatim arguens insolentiam sententiae aureasque litteras contra patrium morem$$ Tiberius deferred any investigation into the priest's legal position ,  but he modified the ceremonies which had been decreed in honour of Drusus's tribunitian power with special censure on the extravagance of the proposed inscription in gold ,  so contrary to national usage
 recitatae et Drusi epistulae quamquam ad modestiam flexae pro superbissimis accipiuntur$$ Letters also from Drusus were read ,  which ,  though studiously modest in expression ,  were taken to be extremely supercilious
 huc decidisse cuncta ut ne iuvenis quidem tanto honore accepto adiret urbis deos , ingrederetur senatum , auspicia saltem gentile apud solum inciperet$$ We have fallen so low ,  people said ,  that even a mere youth who has received so high an honour does not go as a worshipper to the city's gods ,  does not enter the Senate ,  does not so much as take the auspices on his country's soil
 bellum scilicet aut diverso terrarum distineri , litora et lacus Campaniae cum maxime peragrantem$$ There is a war ,  forsooth ,  or he is kept from us in some remote part of the world
 sic imbui rectorem generis humani , id primum e paternis consiliis discere$$ Why ,  at this very moment ,  he is on a tour amid the shores and lakes of Campania
 sane gravaretur aspectum civium senex imperator fessamque aetatem et actos labores praetenderet$$ Such is the training of the future ruler of mankind such the lesson he first learns from his father's counsels
 Druso quod nisi ex adrogantia impedimentum$$ An aged emperor may indeed shrink from the citizen's gaze ,  and plead the weariness of declining years and the toils of the past
 Sed Tiberius , vim principatus sibi firmans , imaginem antiquitatis senatui praebebat postulata provinciarum ad disquisitionem patrum mittendo$$ Tiberius meantime ,  while securing to himself the substance of imperial power ,  allowed the Senate some shadow of its old constitution by referring to its investigation certain demands of the provinces
 crebrescebat enim Graecas per urbes licentia atque impunitas asyla statuendi$$ In the Greek cities license and impunity in establishing sanctuaries were on the increase
 complebantur templa pessimis servitiorum$$ Temples were thronged with the vilest of the slaves
 eodem subsidio obaerati adversum creditores suspectique capitalium criminum receptabantur , nec ullum satis validum imperium erat coercendis seditionibus populi flagitia hominum ut caerimonias deum protegentis$$ the same refuge screened the debtor against his creditor ,  as well as men suspected of capital offences No authority was strong enough to check the turbulence of a people which protected the crimes of men as much as the worship of the gods
 igitur placitum ut mitterent civitates iura atque legatos$$ It was accordingly decided that the different states were to send their charters and envoys to Rome
 et quaedam quod falso usurpaverant sponte omisere$$ Some voluntarily relinquished privileges which they had groundlessly usurped
 multae vetustis superstitionibus aut meritis in populum Romanum fidebant$$ many trusted to old superstitions ,  or to their services to the Roman people
 magnaque eius diei species fuit quo senatus maiorum beneficia , sociorum pacta , regum etiam qui ante vim Romanam valuerant decreta ipsorumque numinum religiones introspexit , libero , ut quondam , quid firmaret mutaretve$$ It was a grand spectacle on that day ,  when the Senate examined grants made by our ancestors ,  treaties with allies ,  even decrees of kings who had flourished before Rome's ascendancy ,  and the forms of worship of the very deities ,  with full liberty as in former days ,  to ratify or to alter
 Primi omnium Ephesii adiere , memorantes non , ut vulgus crederet , Dianam atque Apollinem Delo genitos$$ First of all came the people of Ephesus They declared that Diana and Apollo were not born at Delos ,  as was the vulgar belief
 esse apud se Cenchreum amnem , lucum Ortygiam , ubi Latonam partu gravidam et oleae , quae tum etiam maneat , adnisam edidisse ea numina , deorumque monitu sacratum nemus , atque ipsum illic Apollinem post interfectos Cyclopas Iovis iram vitavisse$$ They had in their own country a river Cenchrius ,  a grove Ortygia ,  where Latona ,  as she leaned in the pangs of labour on an olive still standing ,  gave birth to those two deities ,  whereupon the grove at the divine intimation was consecrated There Apollo himself ,  after the slaughter of the Cyclops ,  shunned the wrath of Jupiter
 mox Liberum patrem , bello victorem , supplicibus Amazonum quae aram insiderant ignovisse$$ there too father Bacchus ,  when victorious in war ,  pardoned the suppliant Amazons who had gathered round the shrine
 auctam hinc concessu Herculis , cum Lydia poteretur , caerimoniam templo neque Persarum dicione deminutum ius$$ Subsequently by the permission of Hercules ,  when he was subduing Lydia ,  the grandeur of the temple's ceremonial was augmented ,  and during the Persian rule its privileges were not curtailed
 post Macedonas , dein nos servavisse$$ They had afterwards been maintained by the Macedonians ,  then by ourselves
 Proximi hos Magnetes Lucius Scipionis et Lucius Sullae constitutis nitebantur , quorum ille Antiocho , hic Mithridate pulsis fidem atque virtutem Magnetum decoravere , uti Dianae Leucophrynae perfugium inviolabile foret$$ Next the people of Magnesia relied on arrangements made by Lucius Scipio and Lucius Sulla These generals ,  after respectively defeating Antiochus and Mithridates ,  honoured the fidelity and courage of the Magnesians by allowing the temple of Diana of the White Brow to be an inviolable sanctuary
 Aphrodisienses posthac et Strationicenses dictatoris Caesaris ob vetusta in partis merita et recens divi Augusti decretum adtulere , laudati quod Parthorum inruptionem nihil mutata in populum Romanum constantia pertulissent$$ Then the people of Aphrodisia produced a decree of the dictator Caesar for their old services to his party ,  and those of Stratonicea ,  one lately passed by the Divine Augustus ,  in which they were commended for having endured the Parthian invasion without wavering in their loyalty to the Roman people
 sed Aphrodisiensium civitas Veneris , Stratonicensium Iovis et Triviae religionem tuebantur$$ Aphrodisia maintained the worship of Venus Stratonicea ,  that of Jupiter and of Diana of the Cross Ways
 altius Hierocaesarienses exposuere , Persicam apud se Dianam , delubrum rege Cyro dicatum$$ Hierocaesarea went back to a higher antiquity ,  and spoke of having a Persian Diana ,  whose fane was consecrated in the reign of Cyrus
 et memorabantur Perpennae , Isaurici multaque alia imperatorum nomina qui non modo templo sed duobus milibus passuum eandem sanctitatem tribuerant$$ They quoted too the names of Perperna ,  Isauricus ,  and many other generals who had conceded the same sacred character not only to the temple but to its precincts for two miles
 exim Cyprii tribus de delubris , quorum vetustissimum Paphiae Veneri auctor Aesrias , post filius eius Amathus Veneri Amathusiae et Iovi Salaminio Teucer , Telamonis patris ira profugus , posuissent$$ Then came the Cyprians on behalf of three shrines ,  the oldest of which had been set up by their founder Aerias to the Paphian Venus ,  the second by his son Amathus to Venus of Amathus ,  and the last to Jupiter of Salamis ,  by Teucer when he fled from the wrath of his father Telamon
 Auditae aliarum quoque civitatium legationem$$ Audience was also given to embassies from other states
 quorum copia fessi patres , et quia studiis certabatur , consulibus permisere ut perspecto iure , et si qua iniquitas involveretur , rem integram rursum ad senatum referrent$$ The senators wearied by their multiplicity and seeing the party spirit that was being roused ,  intrusted the inquiry to the consuls ,  who were to sift each title and see if it involved any abuse ,  and then refer back the entire matter to the Senate
 consules super eas civitates quas memoravi apud Pergamum Aesculapii compertum asylum rettulerunt ceteros obscuris ob vetustatem initiis niti$$ Besides the states already mentioned ,  the consuls reported that they had ascertained that at Pergamus there was a sanctuary of Aesculapius ,  but that the rest relied on an origin lost in the obscurity of antiquity
 nam Zmyrnaeos oraculum Apollinis , cuius imperio Stratonicidi Veneri templum dicaverint , Tenios eiusdem carmen referre , quo sacrare Neptuni effigiem aedemque iussi sint$$ For example ,  the people of Smyrna quoted an oracle of Apollo ,  which had commanded them to dedicate a temple to Venus Stratonicis and the islanders of Tenos ,  an utterance from the same deity ,  bidding them consecrate a statue and a fane to Neptune
 propiora Sardianos$$ Sardis preferred a more modern claim ,  a grant from the victorious Alexander
 Alexandri victoris id donum$$ So again Miletus relied on king Darius
 neque minus Milesios Dareo rege niti$$ But in each case their religious worship was that of Diana or Apollo
 set cultus numinum utrisque Dianam aut Apollinem venerandi$$ The Cretans too demanded a like privilege for a statue of the Divine Augustus
 petere et Cretenses simulacro divi Augusti factaque senatus consulta quis multo cum honore modus tamen praescribebatur iussique ipsis in templis figere aera sacrandam ad memoriam , neu specie religionis in ambitionem delaberentur$$ Decrees of the Senate were passed ,  which though very respectful ,  still prescribed certain limits ,  and the petitioners were directed to set up bronze tablets in each temple ,  to be a sacred memorial and to restrain them from sinking into selfish aims under the mask of religion
 Exequi sententias haud institui nisi insignis per honestum aut notabili dedecore , quod praecipuum munus annalium reor ne virtutes sileantur utque pravis dictis factisque ex posteritate et infamia metus sit ceterum tempora illa adeo infecta et adulatione sordida fuere ut non modo primores civitatis , quibus claritudo sua obsequiis protegenda erat , sed omnes consulares , magna pars eorum qui praetura functi multique etiam pedarii senatores certatim exsurgerent foedaque et nimia censerent$$ My purpose is not to relate at length every motion ,  but only such as were conspicuous for excellence or notorious for infamy This I regard as history's highest function ,  to let no worthy action be uncommemorated ,  and to hold out the reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and deeds So corrupted indeed and debased was that age by sycophancy that not only the foremost citizens who were forced to save their grandeur by servility ,  but every exconsul ,  most of the ex-praetors and a host of inferior senators would rise in eager rivalry to propose shameful and preposterous motions
 memoriae proditur Tiberium , quoties curia egrederetur , Graecis verbis in hunc modum eloqui solitum o homines ad servitutem paratos! scilicet etiam illum qui libertatem publicam nollet tam proiectae servientium patientiae taedebat$$ Tradition says that Tiberius as often as he left the Senate-House used to exclaim in Greek ,  How ready these men are to be slaves Clearly ,  even he ,  with his dislike of public freedom ,  was disgusted at the abject abasement of his creatures
 Paulatim dehinc ab indecoris ad infesta transgrediebantur$$ From unseemly flatteries they passed by degrees to savage acts
 Gaius Silanum pro consule Asiae repetundarum a sociis postulatum Mamercus Scaurus e consularibus , Iunius Otho praetor , Bruttedius Niger aedilis simul corripiunt obiectantque violatum Augusti numen , spretam Tiberii maiestatem , Mamercus antiqua exempla iaciens , Lucius Cottam a Scipione Africano , Servium Galbam a Catone censorio , Publius Rutilium a Marcus Scauro accusatos$$ Caius Silanus ,  pro-consul of Asia ,  was accused by our allies of extortion whereupon Mamercus Scaurus ,  an ex-consul ,  Junius Otho ,  a praetor ,  Brutidius Niger ,  an aedile ,  simultaneously fastened on him and charged him with sacrilege to the divinity of Augustus ,  and contempt of the majesty of Tiberius ,  while Mamercus Scaurus quoted old precedents ,  the prosecutions of Lucius Cotta by Scipio Africanus ,  of Servius Galba by Cato the Censor and of Publius Rutilius by Scaurus
 videlicet Scipio et Cato talia ulciscebantur aut ille Scaurus , quem proavum suum obprobrium maiorum Mamercus infami opera dehonestabat$$ As if indeed Scipio's and Cato's vengeance fell on such offences ,  or that of the famous Scaurus ,  whom his great grandson ,  a blot on his ancestry ,  this Mamercus was now disgracing by his infamous occupation
 Iunio Othoni litterarium ludum exercere vetus ars fuit$$ Junius Otho's old employment had been the keeping of a preparatory school
 mox Seiani potentia senator obscura initia impudentibus ausis propolluebat$$ Subsequently ,  becoming a senator by the influence of Sejanus ,  he shamed his origin ,  low as it was ,  by his unblushing effronteries
 Bruttedium artibus honestis copiosum et , si rectum iter pergeret , ad clarissima quaeque iturum festinatio extimulabat , dum aequalis , dein superiores , postremo suasmet ipse spes antire parat$$ Brutidius who was rich in excellent accomplishments ,  and was sure ,  had he pursued a path of virtue ,  to reach the most brilliant distinction ,  was goaded on by an eager impatience ,  while he strove to outstrip his equals ,  then his superiors ,  and at last even his own aspirations
 quod multos etiam bonos pessum dedit , qui spretis quae tarda cum securitate praematura vel cum exitio properant$$ Many have thus perished ,  even good men ,  despising slow and safe success and hurrying on even at the cost of ruin to premature greatness
 Auxere numerum accusatorum Gellius Publicola et Paconius , ille quaestor Silani , hic legatus$$ Gellius Publicola and Marcus Paconius ,  respectively quaestor and lieutenant of Silanus ,  swelled the number of the accusers
 nec dubium habebatur saevitiae captarumque pecuniarum teneri reum sed multa adgerebantur etiam insontibus periculosa , cum super tot senatores adversos facundissimis totius Asiae eoque ad accusandum delectis responderet solus et orandi nescius , proprio in metu qui exercitam quoque eloquentiam debilitat , non temperante Tiberio quin premeret voce vultu , eo quod ipse creberrime interrogabat , neque refellere aut eludere dabatur , ac saepe etiam confitendum erat ne frustra quaesivisset servos quoque Silani ut tormentis interrogarentur actor publicus mancipio acceperat$$ No doubt was felt as to the defendant's conviction for oppression and extortion ,  but there was a combination against him ,  that must have been perilous even to an innocent man Besides a host of adverse Senators there were the most accomplished orators of all Asia ,  who ,  as such ,  had been retained for the prosecution ,  and to these he had to reply alone ,  without any experience in pleading ,  and under that personal apprehension which is enough to paralyse even the most practised eloquence For Tiberius did not refrain from pressing him with angry voice and look ,  himself putting incessant questions ,  without allowing him to rebut or evade them ,  and he had often even to make admissions ,  that the questions might not have been asked in vain
 et ne quis necessariorum iuvaret periclitantem maiestatis crimina subdebantur , vinclum et necessitas silendi$$ His slaves too were sold by auction to the state-agent ,  to be examined by torture And that not a friend might help him in his danger ,  charges of treason were added ,  a binding guarantee for sealed lips
 igitur petito paucorum dierum interiectu defensionem sui deseruit , ausis ad Caesarem codicillis quibus invidiam et preces miscuerat$$ Accordingly he begged a few days' respite ,  and at last abandoned his defence ,  after venturing on a memorial to the emperor ,  in which he mingled reproach and entreaty
 At Cornelius Dolabella dum adulationem longius sequitur increpitis Gaius Silani moribus addidit ne quis vita probrosus et opertus infamia provinciam sortiretur , idque princeps diiudicaret$$ Cornelius Dolabella however ,  by way of carrying flattery yet further ,  sharply censured the morals of Silanus ,  and then moved that no one of disgraceful life and notorious infamy should be eligible for a province ,  and that of this the emperor should be judge
 nam a legibus delicta puniri$$ Laws ,  indeed ,  he said ,  punish crimes committed
 quanto fore mitius in ipsos , melius in socios , provideri ne peccaretur$$ but how much more merciful would it be to individuals ,  how much better for our allies ,  to provide against their commission
 adversum quae disseruit Caesar$$ The emperor opposed the motion
 non quidem sibi ignare quae de Silano vulgabantur , sed non ex rumore statuendum$$ Although ,  he said ,  I am not ignorant of the reports about Silanus ,  still we must decide nothing by hearsay
 multos in provinciis contra quam spes aut metus de illis fuerit egisse$$ Many a man has behaved in a province quite otherwise than was hoped or feared of him
 excitari quosdam ad meliora magnitudine rerum , hebescere alios$$ Some are roused to higher things by great responsibility
 neque posse principem sua scientia cuncta complecti neque expedire ut ambitione aliena trahatur$$ others are paralysed by it It is not possible for a prince's knowledge to embrace everything ,  and it is not expedient that he should be exposed to the ambitious schemings of others
 ideo leges in facta constitui quia futura in incerto sint$$ Laws are ordained to meet facts ,  inasmuch as the future is uncertain
 sic a maioribus institutum ut , si antissent delicta , poenae sequerentur$$ It was the rule of our ancestors that ,  whenever there was first an offence ,  some penalty should follow
 ne verterent sapienter reperta et semper placita$$ Let us not revolutionise a wisely devised and ever approved system
 satis onerum principibus , satis etiam potentiae$$ Princes have enough burdens ,  and also enough power
 minui iura quotiens gliscat potestas , nec utendum imperio ubi legibus agi possit$$ Rights are invariably abridged ,  as despotism increases
 quanto rarior apud Tiberium popularitas tanto laetioribus animis accepta$$ nor ought we to fall back on imperial authority ,  when we can have recourse to the laws
 atque ille prudens moderandi , si propria ira non impelleretur , addidit insulam Gyarum immitem et sine cultu hominum esse$$ Such constitutional sentiments were so rare with Tiberius ,  that they were welcomed with all the heartier joy
 darent Iuniae familiae et viro quondam ordinis eiusdem ut Cythnum potius concederet id sororem quoque Silani Torquatam , priscae sanctimoniae virginem , expetere$$ Knowing ,  as he did ,  how to be forbearing ,  when he was not under the stimulus of personal resentment ,  he further said that Gyarus was a dreary and uninhabited island ,  and that ,  as a concession to the Junian family and to a man of the same order as themselves ,  they might let him retire by preference to Cythnus
 in hanc sententiam facta discessio$$ This ,  he added ,  was also the request of Torquata ,  Silanus's sister ,  a vestal of primitive purity
 Isdem diebus Lepidus ab senatu petivit ut basilicam Pauli , Aemilia monimenta , propria pecunia firmaret ornaretque$$ About the same time Lepidus asked the Senate's leave to restore and embellish ,  at his own expense ,  the basilica of Paulus ,  that monument of the Aemilian family
 erat etiam tum in more publica munificentia nec Augustus arcuerat Taurum , Philippum , Balbum hostilis exuvias aut exundantis opes ornatum ad urbis et posterum gloriam conferre$$ Public-spirited munificence was still in fashion ,  and Augustus had not hindered Taurus ,  Philippus ,  or Balbus from applying the spoils of war or their superfluous wealth to adorn the capital and to win the admiration of posterity
 quo tum exemplo Lepidus , quamquam pecuniae modicus , avitum decus recoluit$$ Following these examples ,  Lepidus ,  though possessed of a moderate fortune ,  now revived the glory of his ancestors
 at Pompei theatrum igne fortuito haustum Caesar extructurum pollicitus est eo quod nemo e familia restaurando sufficeret , manente tamen nomine Pompei$$ Pompeius's theatre ,  which had been destroyed by an accidental fire ,  the emperor promised to rebuild ,  simply because no member of the family was equal to restoring it ,  but Pompeius's name was to be retained
 simul laudibus Seianum extulit tamquam labore vigilantiaque eius tanta vis unum intra damnum stetisset$$ At the same time he highly extolled Sejanus on the ground that it was through his exertions and vigilance that such fury of the flames had been confined to the destruction of a single building
 et censuere patres effigiem Seiano quae apud theatrum Pompei locaretur$$ The Senate voted Sejanus a statue ,  which was to be placed in Pompeius's theatre
 neque multo post Caesar , cum Iunium Blaesum pro consule Africae triumphi insignibus attolleret , dare id se dixit honori Seiani , cuius ille avunculus erat$$ And soon afterwards the emperor in honouring Junius Blaesus proconsul of Africa ,  with triumphal distinctions ,  said that he granted them as a compliment to Sejanus ,  whose uncle Blaesus was
 Nam Tacfarinas , quamquam saepius depulsus , reparatis per intima Africae auxiliis huc adrogantiae venerat ut legatos ad Tiberium mitteret sedemque ultro sibi atque exercitui suo postularet aut bellum inexplicabile minitaretur$$ Still the career of Blaesus merited such a reward For Tacfarinas ,  though often driven back ,  had recruited his resources in the interior of Africa ,  and had become so insolent as to send envoys to Tiberius ,  actually demanding a settlement for himself and his army ,  or else threatening us with an interminable war
 non alias magis sua populique Romani contumelia indoluisse Caesarem ferunt quam quod desertor et praedo hostium more ageret$$ Never ,  it is said ,  was the emperor so exasperated by an insult to himself and the Roman people as by a deserter and brigand assuming the character of a belligerent
 ne Spartaco quidem post tot consularium exercituum cladis inultam Italiam urenti , quamquam Sertorii atque Mithridatis ingentibus bellis labaret res publica , datum ut pacto in fidem acciperetur$$ Even Spartacus when he had destroyed so many consular armies and was burning Italy with impunity ,  though the State was staggering under the tremendous wars of Sertorius and Mithridates ,  had not the offer of an honourable surrender on stipulated conditions
 nedum pulcherrimo populi Romani fastigio latro Tacfarinas pace et concessione agrorum redimeretur$$ far less ,  in Rome's most glorious height of power ,  should a robber like Tacfarinas be bought off by peace and concessions of territory
 dat negotium Blaeso ceteros quidem ad spem proliceret arma sine noxa ponendi , ipsius autem ducis quoquo modo poteretur$$ He intrusted the affair to Blaesus ,  who was to hold out to the other rebels the prospect of laying down their arms without hurt to themselves ,  while he was by any means to secure the person of the chief
 et recepti ea venia plerique$$ Many surrendered themselves on the strength of this amnesty
 mox adversum artes Tacfarinatis haud dissimili modo belligeratum$$ Before long the tactics of Tacfarinas were encountered in a similar fashion
 Nam quia ille robore exercitus impar , furandi melior , pluris per globos incursaret eluderetque et insidias simul temptaret , tres incessus , totidem agmina parantur$$ Unequal to us in solid military strength ,  but better in a war of surprises ,  he would attack ,  would elude pursuit ,  and still arrange ambuscades with a multitude of detachments
 ex quis Cornelius Scipio legatus praefuit qua praedatio in Leptitanos et suffugia Garamantum$$ And so we prepared three expeditions and as many columns
 alio latere , ne Cirtensium pagi impune traherentur , propriam manum Blaesus filius duxit$$ One of the three under the command of Cornelius Scipio ,  Blaesus's lieutenant ,  was to stop the enemy's forays on the Leptitani and his retreat to the Garamantes
 medio cum delectis , castella et munitiones idoneis locis imponens , dux ipse arta et infensa hostibus cuncta fecerat , quia , quoquo inclinarent , pars aliqua militis Romani in ore , in latere et saepe a tergo erat multique eo modo caesi aut circumventi tunc tripertitum exercitum pluris in manus dispergit praeponitque centuriones virtutis expertae$$ In another quarter ,  Blaesus's son led a separate force of his own ,  to save the villages of Cirta from being ravaged with impunity Between the two was the general himself with some picked troops By establishing redoubts and fortified lines in commanding positions ,  he had rendered the whole country embarrassing and perilous to the foe ,  for ,  whichever way he turned ,  a body of Roman soldiers was in his face ,  or on his flank ,  or frequently in the rear
 nec , ut mos fuerat , acta aestate retrahit copias aut in hibernaculis veteris provinciae componit , sed ut in limine belli dispositis castellis per expeditos et solitudinum gnaros mutantem mapalia Tacfarinatem proturbabat , donec fratre eius capto regressus est , properantius tamen quam ex utilitate sociorum , relictis per quos resurgeret bellum sed Tiberius pro confecto interpretatus id quoque Blaeso tribuit ut imperator a legionibus salutaretur , prisco erga duces honore qui bene gesta re publica gaudio et impetu victoris exercitus conclamabantur erantque plures simul imperatores nec super ceterorum aequalitatem$$ Many were thus slain or surprised Blaesus then further divided his triple army into several detachments under the command of centurions of tried valour At the end of the summer he did not ,  as was usual ,  withdraw his troops and let them rest in winter-quarters in the old province but ,  forming a chain of forts ,  as though he were on the threshold of a campaign ,  he drove Tacfarinas by flying columns well acquainted with the desert ,  from one set of huts to another ,  till he captured the chief's brother ,  and then returned ,  too soon however for the welfare of our allies ,  as there yet remained those who might renew hostilities Tiberius however considered the war as finished ,  and awarded Blaesus the further distinction of being hailed Imperator by the legions ,  an ancient honour conferred on generals who for good service to the State were saluted with cheers of joyful enthusiasm by a victorious army
 concessit quibusdam et Augustus id vocabulum ac tunc Tiberius Blaeso postremum$$ Several men bore the title at the same time ,  without pre-eminence above their fellows
 Obiere eo anno viri inlustres Asinius Saloninus , Marco Agrippa et Pollione Asinio avis , fratre Druso insignis Caesarique progener destinatus , et Capito Ateius , de quo memoravi , principem in civitate locum studiis civilibus adsecutus , sed avo centurione Sullano , patre praetorio$$ Two illustrious men died that year One was Asinius Saloninus ,  distinguished as the grandson of Marcus Agrippa ,  and Asinius Pollio ,  as the brother of Drusus and the intended husband of the emperor's granddaughter The other was Capito Ateius ,  already mentioned ,  who had won a foremost position in the State by his legal attainments ,  though his grandfather was but a centurion in Sulla's army ,  his father having been a praetor
 consulatum ei adceleraverat Augustus ut Labeonem Antistium isdem artibus praecellentem dignatione eius magistratus antiret$$ He was prematurely advanced to the consulship by Augustus ,  so that he might be raised by the honour of this promotion above Labeo Antistius ,  a conspicuous member of the same profession
 namque illa aetas duo pacis decora simul tulit$$ That age indeed produced at one time two brilliant ornaments of peace
 sed Labeo incorrupta libertate et ob id fama celebratior , Capitonis obsequium dominantibus magis probabatur$$ But while Labeo was a man of sturdy independence and consequently of wider fame ,  Capito's obsequiousness was more acceptable to those in power
 illi quod praeturam intra stetit commendatio ex iniuria , huic quod consulatum adeptus est odium ex invidia oriebatur$$ Labeo ,  because his promotion was confined to the praetorship ,  gained in public favour through the wrong Capito ,  in obtaining the consulship ,  incurred the hatred which grows out of envy
 Gaius Asinio Gaius Antistio consulibus nonus Tiberio annus erat compositae rei publicae , florentis domus (nam Germanici mortem inter prospera ducebat) , cum repente turbare fortuna coepit , saevire ipse aut saevientibus viris praebere$$ THE year when Caius Asinius and Caius Antistius were consuls was the ninth of Tiberius's reign ,  a period of tranquillity for the State and prosperity for his own house ,  for he counted Germanicus's death a happy incident Suddenly fortune deranged everything the emperor became a cruel tyrant ,  as well as an abettor of cruelty in others
 initium et causa penes Aelium Seianum cohortibus praetoriis praefectum cuius de potentia supra memoravi$$ Of this the cause and origin was Aelius Sejanus ,  commander of the praetorian cohorts ,  of whose influence I have already spoken
 nunc originem , mores , et quo facinore dominationem raptum ierit expediam$$ I will now fully describe his extraction ,  his character ,  and the daring wickedness by which he grasped at power
 genitus Vulsiniis patre Seio Strabone equite Romano , et prima iuventa Gaium Caesarem divi Augusti nepotem sectatus , non sine rumore Apicio diviti et prodigo stuprum veno dedisse , mox Tiberium variis artibus devinxit adeo ut obscurum adversum alios sibi uni incautum intectumque efficeret , non tam sollertia (quippe isdem artibus victus est) quam deum ira in rem Romanam , cuius pari exitio viguit ceciditque$$ Born at Vulsinii ,  the son of Seius Strabo ,  a Roman knight ,  he attached himself in his early youth to Caius Caesar ,  grandson of the Divine Augustus ,  and the story went that he had sold his person to Apicius ,  a rich debauchee Soon afterwards he won the heart of Tiberius so effectually by various artifices that the emperor ,  ever dark and mysterious towards others ,  was with Sejanus alone careless and freespoken It was not through his craft ,  for it was by this very weapon that he was overthrown it was rather from heaven's wrath against Rome ,  to whose welfare his elevation and his fall were alike disastrous
 corpus illi laborum tolerans , animus audax$$ He had a body which could endure hardships ,  and a daring spirit
 sui obtegens , in alios criminator$$ He was one who screened himself ,  while he was attacking others
 iuxta adulatio et superbia$$ he was as cringing as he was imperious
 palam compositus pudor , intus summa apiscendi libido , eiusque causa modo largitio et luxus , saepius industria ac vigilantia , haud minus noxiae quotiens parando regno finguntur$$ before the world he affected humility in his heart he lusted after supremacy ,  for the sake of which he sometimes lavish and luxurious ,  but oftener energetic and watchful ,  qualities quite as mischievous when hypocritically assumed for the attainment of sovereignty
 Vim praefecturae modicam antea intendit , dispersas per urbem cohortis una in castra conducendo , ut simul imperia acciperent numeroque et robore et visu inter se fiducia ipsis , in ceteros metus oreretur$$ He strengthened the hitherto moderate powers of his office by concentrating the cohorts scattered throughout the capital into one camp ,  so that they might all receive orders at the same moment ,  and that the sight of their numbers and strength might give confidence to themselves ,  while it would strike terror into the citizens
 praetendebat lascivire militem diductum si quid subitum ingruat , maiore auxilio pariter subveniri et severius acturos si vallum statuatur procul urbis inlecebris$$ His pretexts were the demoralisation incident to a dispersed soldiery ,  the greater effectiveness of simultaneous action in the event of a sudden peril ,  and the stricter discipline which would be insured by the establishment of an encampment at a distance from the temptations of the city
 ut perfecta sunt castra , inrepere paulatim militaris animos adeundo , appellando$$ As soon as the camp was completed ,  he crept gradually into the affections of the soldiers by mixing with them and addressing them by name ,  himself selecting the centurions and tribunes
 simul centuriones ac tribunos ipse deligere neque senatorio ambitu abstinebat clientes suos honoribus aut provinciis ornandi , facili Tiberio atque ita prono ut socium laborum non modo in sermonibus , sed apud patres et populum celebraret colique per theatra et fora effigies eius interque principia legionum sineret$$ With the Senate too he sought to ingratiate himself ,  distinguishing his partisans with offices and provinces ,  Tiberius readily yielding ,  and being so biassed that not only in private conversation but before the senators and the people he spoke highly of him as the partner of his toils ,  and allowed his statues to be honoured in theatres ,  in forums ,  and at the head-quarters of our legions
 Italiam utroque mari duae classes , Misenum apud et Ravennam , proximumque Galliae litus rostratae naves praesidebant , quas Actiaca victoria captas Augustus in oppidum Foroiuliense miserat valido cum remige$$ Italy on both seas was guarded by fleets ,  at Misenum and at Ravenna ,  and the contiguous coast of Gaul by ships of war captured in the victory of Actium ,  and sent by Augustus powerfully manned to the town of Forojulium
 sed praecipuum robur Rhenum iuxta , commune in Germanos Gallosque subsidium , octo legiones erant$$ But chief strength was on the Rhine ,  as a defence alike against Germans and Gauls ,  and numbered eight legions
 Hispaniae recens perdomitae tribus habebantur$$ Spain ,  lately subjugated ,  was held by three
 Mauros Iuba rex acceperat donum populi Romani$$ Mauretania was king Juba's ,  who had received it as a gift from the Roman people
 cetera Africae per duas legiones parique numero Aegyptus , dehinc initio ab Syriae usque ad flumen Euphraten , quantum ingenti terrarum sinu ambitur , quattuor legionibus coercita , accolis Hibero Albanoque et aliis regibus qui magnitudine nostra proteguntur adversum extema imperia et Thraeciam Rhoemetalces ac liberi Cotyis , ripamque Danuvii legionum duae in Pannonia , duae in Moesia attinebant , totidem apud Delmatiam locatis , quae positu regionis a tergo illis , ac si repentinum auxilium Italia posceret , haud procul accirentur , quamquam insideret urbem proprius miles , tres urbanae , novem praetoriae cohortes , Etruria ferme Vmbriaque delectae aut vetere Latio et coloniis antiquitus Romanis$$ The rest of Africa was garrisoned by two legions ,  and Egypt by the same number Next ,  beginning with Syria ,  all within the entire tract of country stretching as far as the Euphrates ,  was kept in restraint by four legions ,  and on this frontier were Iberian ,  Albanian ,  and other kings ,  to whom our greatness was a protection against any foreign power Thrace was held by Rhoemetalces and the children of Cotys the bank of the Danube by two legions in Pannonia ,  two in Moesia ,  and two also were stationed in Dalmatia ,  which ,  from the situation of the country ,  were in the rear of the other four ,  and ,  should Italy suddenly require aid ,  not to distant to be summoned But the capital was garrisoned by its own special soldiery ,  three city ,  nine praetorian cohorts ,  levied for the most part in Etruria and Umbria ,  or ancient Latium and the old Roman colonies
 at apud idonea provinciarum sociae triremes alaeque et auxilia cohortium , neque multo secus in iis virium$$ There were besides ,  in commanding positions in the provinces ,  allied fleets ,  cavalry and light infantry ,  of but little inferior strength
 sed persequi incertum fuit , cum ex usu temporis huc illuc mearent , gliscerent numero et aliquando minuerentur$$ But any detailed account of them would be misleading ,  since they moved from place to place as circumstances required ,  and had their numbers increased and sometimes diminished
 Congruens crediderim recensere ceteras quoque rei publicae partis , quibus modis ad eam diem habitae sint , quoniam Tiberio mutati in deterius principatus initium ille annus attulit$$ It is however ,  I think ,  a convenient opportunity for me to review the hitherto prevailing methods of administration in the other departments of the State ,  inasmuch as that year brought with it the beginning of a change for the worse in Tiberius's policy
 iam primum publica negotia et privatorum maxima apud patres tractabantur , dabaturque primoribus disserere et in adulationem lapsos cohibebat ipse$$ In the first place ,  public business and the most important private matters were managed by the Senate 
 mandabatque honores , nobilitatem maiorum , claritudinem militiae , iniustris domi artes spectando , ut satis constaret non alios potiores fuisse$$  the leading men were allowed freedom of discussion ,  and when they stooped to flattery ,  the emperor himself checked them
 sua consulibus , sua praetoribus species minorum quoque magistratuum exercita potestas$$ He bestowed honours with regard to noble ancestry ,  military renown ,  or brilliant accomplishments as a civilian ,  letting it be clearly seen that there were no better men to choose
 legesque , si maiestatis quaestio eximeretur , bono in usu$$ The consul and the praetor retained their prestige
 at frumenta et pecuniae vectigales , cetera publicorum fructuum societatibus equitum Romanorum agitabantur$$ inferior magistrates exercised their authority the laws too ,  with the single exception of cases of treason ,  were properly enforced
 res suas Caesar spectatissimo cuique , quibusdam ignotis ex fama mandabat , semelque adsumpti tenebantur prorsus sine modo , cum plerique isdem negotiis insenescereut$$ As to the duties on corn ,  the indirect taxes and other branches of the public revenue ,  they were in the hands of companies of Roman knights
 plebes acri quidem annona fatigabatur , sed nulla in eo culpa ex principe quin infecunditati terrarum aut asperis maris obviam iit , quantum impendio diligentiaque poterat$$ The emperor intrusted his own property to men of the most tried integrity or to persons known only by their general reputation ,  and once appointed they were retained without any limitation ,  so that most of them grew old in the same employments
 et ne provinciae novis oneribus turbarentur utque vetera sine avaritia aut crudelitate magistratnum tolerarent providebat$$ The city populace indeed suffered much from high prices ,  but this was no fault of the emperor ,  who actually endeavoured to counteract barren soils and stormy seas with every resource of wealth and foresight
 corporum verbera , ademptiones bonorum aberant rari per Italiam Caesaris agri , modesta servitia , intra paucos libertos domus$$ And he was also careful not to distress the provinces by new burdens ,  and to see that in bearing the old they were safe from any rapacity or oppression on the part of governors
 ac si quando cum privatis disceptaret , forum et ius$$ Corporal punishments and confiscations of property were unknown
 Quae cuncta non quidem comi via sed horridus ac plerumque formidatus retinebat tamen , donec morte Drusi verterentur$$ The emperor had only a few estates in Italy ,  slaves on a moderate scale ,  and his household was confined to a few freedmen If ever he had a dispute with a private person ,  it was decided in the law courts
 nam dum superfuit mansere , quia Seianus incipiente adhuc potentia bonis consiliis notescere volebat , et ultor metuebatur non occultus odii set crebro querens ro incolumi filio adiutorem imperii alium vocari et quantum superesse ut collega dicatur$$ All this ,  not indeed with any graciousness ,  but in a blunt fashion which often alarmed ,  he still kept up ,  until the death of Drusus changed everything While he lived ,  the system continued ,  because Sejanus ,  as yet only in the beginning of his power ,  wished to be known as an upright counsellor ,  and there was one whose vengeance he dreaded ,  who did not conceal his hatred and incessantly complained that a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive
 primas dominandi spes in arduo$$ How near was the step of declaring the stranger a colleague! Ambition at first had a steep path before it
 ubi sis ingressus , adesse studia et ministros$$ when once the way had been entered ,  zealous adherents were forthcoming
 extructa iam sponte praefecti castra , datos in manum milites$$ Already ,  at the pleasure of the commander of the guards ,  a camp had been established
 cerni effgiem eius in monimentis Gnaeus Pompei$$ the soldiers given into his hands
 communis is illi cum familia Drusorum fore nepotes$$ his statues were to be seen among the monuments of Cneius Pompeius
 precandam post haec modestiam ut contentus esset$$ his grandsons would be of the same blood as the family of the Drusi
 neque raro neque apud paucos talia iaciebat , et secreta quoque eius corrupta uxore prodebantur$$ Henceforth they must pray that he might have self-control ,  and so be contented So would Drusus talk ,  not unfrequently ,  or only in the hearing of a few persons
 Igitur Seianus maturandum ratus deligit venenum quo paulatim inrepente fortuitus morbus adsimularetur$$ Sejanus accordingly thought that he must be prompt ,  and chose a poison the gradual working of which might be mistaken for a natural disorder
 id Druso datum per Lygdum spadonem , ut octo post annos cognitum est$$ It was given to Drusus by Lygdus ,  a eunuch ,  as was ascertained eight years later
 ceterum Tiberius per omnis valetudinis eius dies , nullo metu an ut firmitudinem animi ostentaret , etiam defuncto necdum sepulto , curiam ingressus est$$ As for Tiberius ,  he went to the Senate house during the whole time of the prince's illness ,  either because he was not afraid ,  or to show his strength of mind ,  and even in the interval between his death and funeral
 consulesque sede vulgari per speciem maestitiae sedentis honoris locique admonuit , et effusum in lacrimas senatum victo gemitu simul oratione continua erexit$$ Seeing the consuls ,  in token of their grief ,  sitting on the ordinary benches ,  he reminded them of their high office and of their proper place
 non quidem sibi ignarum posse argui quod tam recenti dolore subierit oculos senatus$$ and when the Senate burst into tears ,  suppressing a groan ,  he revived their spirits with a fluent speech
 vix propinquorum adloquia tolerari , vix diem aspici a plerisque lugentium$$ He knew indeed that he might be reproached for thus encountering the gaze of the Senate after so recent an affliction
 neque illos imbecillitatis damnandos$$ Most mourners could hardly bear even the soothing words of kinsfolk or to look on the light of day
 se tamen fortiora solacia e complexu rei publicae petivisse$$ And such were not to be condemned as weak
 miseratusque Augustae extremam senectam , rudem adhuc nepotum et vergentem aetatem suam , ut Germanici liberi , unica praesentium malorum levatnenta , inducerentur petivit$$ But he had sought a more manly consolation in the bosom of the commonwealth Then deploring the extreme age of Augusta ,  the childhood of his grandsons ,  and his own declining years ,  he begged the Senate to summon Germanicus's children ,  the only comfort under their present misery
 egressi consules firmatos adloquio adulescentulos deductos que ante Caesarem statuunt$$ The consuls went out ,  and having encouraged the young princes with kind words ,  brought them in and presented them to the emperor
 quibus adprensis patres conscripti , hos inquit orbatos parente tradidi patrno ipsorum precatusque sum , quamquam esset illi propria suboles , ne secUs quam snum sanguinem foveret attolleret , sibique et posteris coniormaret$$ Taking them by the hand he said   Senators ,  when these boys lost their father ,  I committed them to their uncle ,  and begged him ,  though he had children of his own ,  to cherish and rear them as his own offspring ,  and train them for himself and for posterity
 erepto Druso preces ad vos converto disque et patria coram obtestor Augusti pro nepotes , clarissimis maioribus genitos , suscipite regite , vestram meamque vicem explete$$ Drusus is now lost to us ,  and I turn my prayers to you ,  and before heaven and your country I adjure you to receive into your care and guidance the great-grandsons of Augustus ,  descendants of a most noble ancestry
 hi vobis , Nero et Druse , parentum loco$$ So fulfil your duty and mine
 ita nati estis ut bona malaque vestra ad rem publicam pertineant$$ To you ,  Nero and Drusus ,  these senators are as fathers
 Magno ea fletu et mox precationibus faustis audita$$ There was great weeping at these words ,  and then many a benediction
 ac si modum orationi posuisset , misericordia sui gloriaque animoi audientium impleverat$$ Had the emperor set bounds to his speech ,  he must have filled the hearts of his hearers with sympathy and admiration
 ad vana et totiens inrisa revolutus , de reddenda re publica utque consules seu quis alius regimen susciperent , vero quoque et honesto fidem dempsit$$ But he now fell back on those idle and often ridiculed professions about restoring the republic ,  and the wish that the consuls or some one else might undertake the government ,  and thus destroyed belief even in what was genuine and noble
 memoriae Drusi eadem quae in Germanicum decernuntur , plerisque additis , ut ferme amat posterior adulatio$$ The same honours were decreed to the memory of Drusus as to that of Germanicus ,  and many more were added
 funus imaginum pompa maxime inlustre fuit , cum origo luliae gentis Aeneas omnesque Albanorum reges et conditor urbis Romulus , post Sabina nobilitas , Attus Clausus ceteracque Claudiorum effigies longo ordine spectarentur$$ Such is the way with flattery ,  when repeated The funeral with its procession of statues was singularly grand Aeneas ,  the father of the Julian house ,  all the Alban kings ,  Romulus ,  Rome's founder ,  then the Sabine nobility ,  Attus Clausus ,  and the busts of all the other Claudii were displayed in a long train
 Ceterum laudante filium pro rostris Tiberio senatus populusque habitum ac voces dolentum simulatione magis quam libens induebat , domumque Germanici revirescere occulti laetabantur$$ Tiberius pronounced a panegyric on his son before the Rostra ,  during which the Senate and people ,  in appearance rather than in heart ,  put on the expression and accents of sorrow ,  while they inwardly rejoiced at the brightening future of the family of Germanicus
 quod principium favoris et mater Agrippina spem male tegens perniciem adceleravere$$ This beginning of popularity and the ill-concealed ambition of their mother Agrippina ,  hastened its downfall
 nam Seianus ubi videt mortem Drusi inultam interfectoribus , sine maerore publico esse , ferox scelerum et , quia prima provenerant , volutare secum quonam modo Germanici liberos perverteret , quorum non dubia successio$$ Sejanus when he saw that the death of Drusus was not avenged on the murderers and was no grief to the people ,  grew bold in wickedness ,  and ,  now that his first attempt had succeeded ,  speculated on the possibility of destroying the children of Germanicus ,  whose succession to the throne was a certainty
 neque spargi venenum in tres poterat , egregia custodum fide et pudicitia Agrippinae impenetrabili$$ There were three ,  and poison could not be distributed among them ,  because of the singular fidelity of their guardians and the unassailable virtue of Agrippina
 igitur contumaciam eius insectari , vetus Augustae odium , recentem Liviae conscientiam exagitare , ut superbam fecunditate , subnixam popularibus studiis inhiare dominationi apud Caesarem arguerent$$ So Sejanus inveighed against Agrippina's arrogance ,  and worked powerfully on Augusta's old hatred of her and on Livia's consciousness of recent guilt ,  and urged both these women to represent to the emperor that her pride as a mother and her reliance on popular enthusiasm were leading her to dream of empire
 atque haec callidis criminatoribus , inter quos delegerat Iulium Postumum , per adulterium Mutiliae Priscae inter intimos aviae et consiliis suis peridoneum , quia Prisca in animo Augustae valida anum suapte natura potentiae anxiam insociabilem nurui efficiebat$$ Livia availed herself of the cunning of accusers ,  among whom she had selected Julius Postumus ,  a man well suited to her purpose ,  as he had an intrigue with Mutilia Prisca ,  and was consequently in the confidence of Augusta ,  over whose mind Prisca had great influence She thus made her aged grandmother ,  whose nature it was to tremble for her power ,  irreconcilably hostile to her grandson's widow
 Agrippinae quoque proximi inliciebantur pravis sermonibus tumidos spiritus perstimulare$$ Agrippina's friends too were induced to be always inciting her proud spirit by mischievous talk
 Sub idem tempus de flamine Diali in locum Servi Maluginensis defuncti legendo , simul roganda nova lege disseruit Caesar$$ About the same time the emperor spoke on the subject of electing a priest of Jupiter in the room of Servius Maluginensis ,  deceased ,  and of the enactment of a new law
 nam patricios confarrc atis parentibus genitos tres simul nominari , ex quis unus legeretur , vetusto more$$ It was ,  he said ,  the old custom to nominate together three patricians ,  sons of parents wedded according to the primitive ceremony ,  and of these one was to be chosen
 neque adesse , ut olim , eam copiam , omissa confarreandi adsuetudine aut inter paucos retenta (pluresque eius rei causas adferebat , potissimam penes incuriam virorum feminarumque$$ Now however there was not the same choice as formerly ,  the primitive form of marriage having been given up or being observed only by a few persons For this he assigned several reasons ,  the chief being men's and women's indifference
 accedere ipsius caerimoniae difltcultates quae consulto vitarentur) et quoniam exiret e iure patrio qui id flamonium apisceretur quaeque in manum flaminis conveniret$$ then ,  again ,  the ceremony itself had its difficulties ,  which were purposely avoided and there was the objection that the man who obtained this priesthood was emancipated from the father's authority ,  as also was his wife ,  as passing into the husband's control
 ita medendum senatus decreto aut lege , sicut Augustus quaedam ex horrida illa antiquitate ad praescentem usum flexisset$$ So the Senate ,  Tiberius argued ,  ought to apply some remedy by a decree of a law ,  as Augustus had accommodated certain relics of a rude antiquity to the modern spirit
 igitur tractatis religionibus placitum instituto flaminum nihil demutari$$ It was then decided ,  after a discussion of religious questions ,  that the institution of the priests of Jupiter should remain unchanged

 solitum quippe magistratibus diem privatis dicere nec infringendum consulis ius , cuius vigiliis niteretur ne quod res publica detrimentum caperet$$ It was usual ,  he argued ,  for magistrates to bring a private citizen to trial ,  and a consul's authority ought not to be impaired ,  seeing that it rested with his vigilance to guard the commonwealth from loss
 proprium id Tiberio fuit scelera nuper reperta priscis verbis obtegere$$ It was characteristic of Tiberius to veil new devices in wickedness under ancient names
 igitur multa adseveratione , quasi aut legibus cum Silio ageretur aut Varro consul aut illud res publica esset , coguntur patres , silente reo , vel si defensionem coeptaret , non occultante cuius ira premeretur$$ And so ,  with a solemn appeal ,  he summoned the Senate ,  as if there were any laws by which Silius was being tried ,  as if Varro were a real consul ,  or Rome a commonwealth The accused either said nothing ,  or ,  if he attempted to defend himself ,  hinted ,  not obscurely ,  at the person whose resentment was crushing him

 et praedatorias manus delecti Maurorum duxere$$ Marauding parties were also led by picked Moors ,  Dolabella in person directing every operation

 differtur per manipulos , Tacfarinatem omnes notum tot proeliis consectentur non nisi duce interfecto requiem belli fore$$ The word went through the companies that all were to aim at securing Tacfarinas ,  whom ,  after so many battles ,  they knew well ,  as there would be no rest from war except by the destruction of the enemy's leader

 Eadem aestate mota per Italiam servilis belli semina fors oppressit$$ The same summer ,  the germs of a slave war in Italy were crushed by a fortunate accident
 auctor tumultus Titus Curtisius , quondam praetoriae cohortis miles , primo coetibus clandestinis apud Brundisium et circumiecta oppida , mox positis propalam libellis ad libertatem vocabat agrestia per longinquos saltus et ferocia servitia , cum velut munere deum tres biremes adpulere ad usus commeantium illo mari et erat isdem regionibus Cutius Lupus quaestor , cui provincia vetere ex more calles evenerant$$ The originator of the movement was Titus Curtisius ,  once a soldier of the praetorian guard First ,  by secret meetings at Brundisium and the neighbouring towns ,  then by placards publicly exhibited ,  he incited the rural and savage slave-population of the remote forests to assert their freedom By divine providence ,  three vessels came to land for the use of those who traversed that sea In the same part of the country too was Curtius Lupus ,  the quaestor ,  who ,  according to ancient precedent ,  had had the charge of the woodland pastures assigned to him
 is disposita classiariomm copia coeptantem cum maxime coniurationem disiecit$$ Putting in motion a force of marines ,  he broke up the seditious combination in its very first beginnings
 missusque a Caesare propere Staius tribunus cum valida manu ducem ipsum et proximos audacia in urbem traxit , lam trepidam ob multitudinem familiarum quae gliscebat immensum , minore in dies plebe ingenua$$ The emperor at once sent Staius ,  a tribune ,  with a strong detachment ,  by whom the ringleader himself ,  with his most daring followers ,  were brought prisoners to Rome where men already trembled at the vast scale of the slave-establishments ,  in which there was an immense growth ,  while the freeborn populace daily decreased
 His tam adsiduis tamque maestis modica laetitia intericitur , quod Gaius Cominium equitem Romanum , probrosi in se carminis convictum , Caesar precibus fratris qui senator erat concessit$$ Some little joy broke this long succession of horrors Caius Cominius ,  a Roman knight ,  was spared by the emperor ,  against whom he was convicted of having written libellous verses ,  at the intercession of his brother ,  who was a Senator
 quo magis mirum habebatur gnarum meliorum et quae fama clementiam sequeretur tristiora malle$$ Hence it seemed the more amazing that one who knew better things and the glory which waits on mercy ,  should prefer harsher courses
 neque enim socordia peccabat nec occultum est , quando ex veritate , quando adumbrata laetitia facta imperatorum celebrentur$$ He did not indeed err from dulness ,  and it is easy to see when the acts of a sovereign meet with genuine ,  and when with fictitious popularity
 quin ipse , compositus alias et velut eluctantium verborum , solutius promptiusque eloquebatur quotiens subveniret$$ And even he himself ,  though usually artificial in manner ,  and though his words escaped him with a seeming struggle ,  spoke out freely and fluently whenever he came to a man's rescue
 at Publius Suillium quaestorem quondam Germanici , cum Italia arceretur convictus pecuniam ob rem iudicandam cepisse , amovendum in insulam censuit , tanta contentione animi ut iure iurando obstringeret e re publica id esse$$ In another case ,  that of Publius Suillius ,  formerly quaestor to Germanicus ,  who was to be expelled from Italy on a conviction of having received money for a judicial decision ,  he held that the man ought to be banished to an island ,  and so intensely strong was his feeling that he bound the Senate by an oath that this was a State necessity
 quod aspere acceptum ad praesens mox in laudem vertit regresso Suillio$$ The act was thought cruel at the moment ,  but subsequently it redounded to his honour when Suillius returned from exile

 Catus , ut rettuli , Libonem inlexerat insidiis , deinde indicio perculerat$$ Catus ,  as I have related ,  had drawn Libo into a snare and then destroyed him by an information
 eius operae memor Tiberius sed alia praetendens exilium de precatus est$$ Tiberius remembering this service ,  while he alleged other reasons ,  deprecated a sentence of exile ,  but did not oppose his expulsion from the Senate
 Nam cunctas nationes et urbes populus aut primores aut singuli regunt$$ All nations and cities are ruled by the people ,  the nobility ,  or by one man
 delecta ex iis et consociata rei publicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire , vel si evenit , haud diuturna esse potest$$ A constitution ,  formed by selection out of these elements ,  it is easy to commend but not to produce
 igitur ut olim plebe valida , vel cum patres pollerent , noscenda vulgi natura et quibus modis temperanter haberetur , senatusque et optimatium ingenia qui maxime perdidicerant , callidi temporum et sapientes credebantur , sic converso statu neque alia re Romana quam si unus imperitet , haec conquiri tradique in rem fuerit , quia pauci prudentia honesta ab deterioribus , utilia ab noxiis discernunt , plures aliorum eventis docentur$$ or ,  if it is produced ,  it cannot be lasting Formerly ,  when the people had power or when the patricians were in the ascendant ,  the popular temper and the methods of controlling it ,  had to be studied ,  and those who knew most accurately the spirit of the Senate and aristocracy ,  had the credit of understanding the age and of being wise men So now ,  after a revolution ,  when Rome is nothing but the realm of a single despot ,  there must be good in carefully noting and recording this period ,  for it is but few who have the foresight to distinguish right from wrong or what is sound from what is hurtful ,  while most men learn wisdom from the fortunes of others
 ceterum ut profutura , ita minimum oblectationis adferunt$$ Still ,  though this is instructive ,  it gives very little pleasure
 nam situs gentium , varietates proeliorum , clari ducum exitus retinent ac redintegrant legentium animum$$ Descriptions of countries ,  the various incidents of battles ,  glorious deaths of great generals ,  enchain and refresh a reader's mind
 nos saeva iussa , continuas accusationes , fallaces amicitias , perniciem innocentium et easdem exitii causas coniungimus , obvia rerum similitudine et satietate$$ I have to present in succession the merciless biddings of a tyrant ,  incessant prosecutions ,  faithless friendships ,  the ruin of innocence ,  the same causes issuing in the same results ,  and I am everywhere confronted by a wearisome monotony in my subject matter
 tum quod antiquis scriptoribus rarus obtrectator , neque refert cuiusquam Punicas Romanasne acies laetius extuleris$$ Then ,  again ,  an ancient historian has but few disparagers ,  and no one cares whether you praise more heartily the armies of Carthage or Rome
 at multorum qui Tiberio regente poenam vel infamias subiere posteri manent$$ But of many who endured punishment or disgrace under Tiberius ,  the descendants yet survive
 utque familiae ipsae iam extinctae sint , reperies qui ob similitudinem morum aliena malefacta sibi obiectari putent$$ or even though the families themselves may be now extinct ,  you will find those who ,  from a resemblance of character ,  imagine that the evil deeds of others are a reproach to themselves
 etiam gloria ac virtus infensos habet , ut nimis ex propinquo diversa arguens$$ Again ,  even honour and virtue make enemies ,  condemning ,  as they do ,  their opposites by too close a contrast
 sed ad inceptum redeo$$ But I return to my work
 Cornelio Cosso Asinio Agrippa consulibus Cremutius Cordus postulatur novo ac tunc primum audito crimine , quod editis annalibus laudatoque Marcus Bruto Gaius Cassium Romanorum ultimum dixisset$$ In the year of the consulship of Cornelius Cossus and Asinius Agrippa ,  Cremutius Cordus was arraigned on a new charge ,  now for the first time heard
 accusabant Satrius Secundus et Pinarius Natta , Seiani clientes$$ He had published a history in which he had praised Marcus Brutus and called Caius Cassius the last of the Romans
 id perniciabile reo et Caesar truci vultu defensionem accipiens , quam Cremutius relinquendae vitae certus in hunc modum exorsus est$$ His accusers were Satrius Secundus and Pinarius Natta ,  creatures of Sejanus
 verba mea , patres conscripti , arguuntur$$ This was enough to ruin the accused
 adeo factorum innocens sum$$ and then too the emperor listened with an angry frown to his defence ,  which Cremutius ,  resolved to give up his life ,  began thus 
 sed neque haec in principem aut principis parentem , quos lex maiestatis amplectitur$$  , It is my words ,  Senators ,  which are condemned ,  so innocent am I of any guilty act
 Brutum et Cassium laudavisse dicor , quorum res gestas cum plurimi composuerint , nemo sine honore memoravit$$ yet these do not touch the emperor or the emperor's mother ,  who are alone comprehended under the law of treason
 Titus Livius , eloquentiae ac fidei praeclarus in primis , Gnaeus Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret$$ I am said to have praised Brutus and Cassius ,  whose careers many have described and no one mentioned without eulogy
 neque id amicitiae eorum offecit Scipionem , Afranium , hunc ipsum Cassium , hunc Brutum nusquam latrones et parricidas , quae nunc vocabula imponuntur , saepe ut insignis viros nominat$$ Titus Livius ,  pre-eminently famous for eloquence and truthfulness ,  extolled Cneius Pompeius in such a panegyric that Augustus called him Pompeianus ,  and yet this was no obstacle to their friendship
 Asinii Pollionis scripta egregiam eorundem memoriam tradunt$$ Scipio ,  Afranius ,  this very Cassius ,  this same Brutus ,  he nowhere describes as brigands and traitors ,  terms now applied to them ,  but repeatedly as illustrious men
 Messala Corvinus imperatorem suum Cassium praedicabat$$ Asinius Pollio's writings too hand down a glorious memory of them ,  and Messala Corvinus used to speak with pride of Cassius as his general
 et uterque opibusque atque honoribus perviguere$$ Yet both these men prospered to the end with wealth and preferment
 Marci Ciceronis libro quo Catonem caelo aequavit , quid aliud dictator Caesar quam rescripta oratione velut apud iudices respondit$$ Again ,  that book of Marcus Cicero ,  in which he lauded Cato to the skies ,  how else was it answered by Caesar the dictator ,  than by a written oration in reply ,  as if he was pleading in court
 Antonii epistulae Bruti contiones falsa quidem in Augustum probra set multa cum acerbitate habent$$ The letters Antonius ,  the harangues of Brutus contain reproaches against Augustus ,  false indeed ,  but urged with powerful sarcasm
 carmina Bibaculi et Catulli referta contumeliis Caesarum leguntur$$ the poems which we read of Bibaculus and Catullus are crammed with invectives on the Caesars
 sed ipse divus Iulius , ipse divus Augustus et tulere ista et reliquere , haud facile dixerim , moderatione magis an sapientia$$ Yet the Divine Julius ,  the Divine Augustus themselves bore all this and let it pass ,  whether in forbearance or in wisdom I cannot easily say
 namque spreta exolescunt$$ Assuredly what is despised is soon forgotten
 si irascare , adgnita videntur$$ when you resent a thing ,  you seem to recognise it
 Per idem tempus Hispania ulterior missis ad senatum legatis oravit ut exemplo Asiae delubrum Tiberio matrique eius extrueret$$ About the same time Further Spain sent a deputation to the Senate ,  with a request to be allowed ,  after the example of Asia ,  to erect a temple to Tiberius and his mother
 qua occasione Caesar , validus alioqui spernendis honoribus et respondendum ratus iis quorum rumore arguebatur in ambitionem flexisse , huiusce modi orationem coepit$$ On this occasion ,  the emperor ,  who had generally a strong contempt for honours ,  and now thought it right to reply to the rumour which reproached him with having yielded to vanity ,  delivered the following speech 
 scio , patres conscripti , constantiam meam a plerisque desideratam quod Asiae civitatibus nuper idem istud petentibus non sim adversatus$$ I am aware ,  Senators ,  that many deplore my want of firmness in not having opposed a similar recent petition from the cities of Asia
 ergo et prioris silentii defensionem et quid in futurum statuerim simul aperiam$$ I will therefore both explain the grounds of my previous silence and my intentions for the future
 cum divus Augustus sibi atque urbi Romae templum apud Pergamum sisti non prohibuisset , qui omnia facta dictaque eius vice legis observem , placitum iam exemplum promptius secutus sum quia cultui meo veneratio senatus adiungebatur$$ Inasmuch as the Divine Augustus did not forbid the founding of a temple at Pergamos to himself and to the city of Rome ,  I who respect as law all his actions and sayings ,  have the more readily followed a precedent once approved ,  seeing that with the worship of myself was linked an expression of reverence towards the Senate
 ceterum ut semel recepisse veniam habuerit , ita per omnis provincias effgie numinum sacrari ambitiosum , superbum et vanescet Augusti honor si promiscis adulationibus vulgatur$$ But though it may be pardonable to have allowed this once ,  it would be a vain and arrogant thing to receive the sacred honour of images representing the divine throughout all the provinces ,  and the homage paid to Augustus will disappear if it is vulgarised by indiscriminate flattery
 Ego me , patres conscripti , mortalem esse et hominum officia fungi satisque habere si locum principem impleam et vos testor et meminisse posteros volo$$ For myself ,  Senators ,  I am mortal and limited to the functions of humanity ,  content if I can adequately fill the highest place
 qui satis superque memoriae meae tribuent , ut maioribus meis dignum , rerum vestrarum providum , constantem in periculis , offensionum pro utilitate publica non pavidum credant$$ of this I solemnly assure you ,  and would have posterity remember it They will more than sufficiently honour my memory by believing me to have been worthy of my ancestry ,  watchful over your interests ,  courageous in danger ,  fearless of enmity ,  when the State required it
 haec mihi in animis vestris templa , hae pulcherrimae effigies et mansurae$$ These sentiments of your hearts are my temples ,  these my most glorious and abiding monuments
 nam quae saxo struuntur , si iudicium posterorum in odium vertit , pro sepulchris spernuntur$$ Those built of stone are despised as mere tombs ,  if the judgment of posterity passes into hatred
 proinde socios civis et deos ipsos precor , hos ut mihi ad finem usque vitae quietam et intellegentem humani divinique iuris mentem duint , illos ut , quandoque concessero , cum laude et bonis recordationibus facta atque famam nominis mei prosequantur$$ And therefore this is my prayer to our allies ,  our citizens ,  and to heaven itself to the last ,  that ,  to my life's close ,  it grant me a tranquil mind ,  which can discern alike human and divine claims to the first ,  that ,  when I die ,  they honour my career and the reputation of my name with praise and kindly remembrance
 perstititque posthac secretis etiam sermonibus aspernari talem sui cultum$$ Henceforth Tiberius even in private conversations persisted in showing contempt for such homage to himself
 quod alii modestiam , multi , quia diffideret , quidam ut degeneris animi interpretabantur$$ Some attributed this to modesty many to self-distrust
 optumos quippe mortalium altissima cupere$$ a few to a mean spirit
 sic Herculem et Liberum apud Graecos , Quirinum apud nos deum numero additos$$ The noblest men ,  it was said ,  have the loftiest aspirations ,  and so Hercules and Bacchus among the Greeks and Quirinus among us were enrolled in the number of the gods
 melius Augustum , qui speraverit$$ Augustus ,  did better ,  seeing that he had aspired
 cetera principibus statim adesse$$ All other things princes have as a matter of course
 unum insatiabiliter parandum , prosperam sui memoriam$$ one thing they ought insatiably to pursue ,  that their memory may be glorious
 nam contemptu famae contemni virtutes$$ For to despise fame is to despise merit
 Ad ea Tiberius laudata pietate Seiani suisque in eum beneficiis modice percursis , cum tempus tamquam ad integram consultationem petivisset , adiunxit ceteris mortalibus in eo stare consilia quid sibi conducere putent$$ Tiberius ,  in reply ,  after praising the loyal sentiments of Sejanus and briefly enumerating the favours he had bestowed on him ,  asked time for impartial consideration ,  adding that while other men's plans depended on their ideas of their own interest ,  princes ,  who had to regulate their chief actions by public opinion ,  were in a different position
 principum diversam esse sortem quibus praecipua rerum ad famam derigenda ideo se non illuc decurrere , quod promptum rescriptu , posse ipsam Liviam statuere , nubendum post Drusum an in penatibus isdem tolerandum haberet$$ Hence ,  he said ,  I do not take refuge in an answer which it would be easy to return ,  that Livia can herself decide whether she considers that ,  after Drusus ,  she ought again to marry or rather to endure life in the same home ,  and that she has in her mother and grandmother counsellors nearer and dearer to her
 esse illi matrem et aviam , propiora consilia$$ I will deal more frankly
 simplicius acturum , de inimicitiis primum Agrippinae , quas longe acrius arsuras si matrimonium Liviae velut in partis domum Caesarum distraxisset$$ First ,  as to the enmity of Agrippina ,  I maintain that it will blaze out more fiercely if Livia's marriage rends ,  so to say ,  the house of the Caesars into two factions
 sic quoque erumpere aemulationem feminarum , eaque discordia nepotes suos convelli$$ Even as it is ,  feminine jealousies break out ,  and my grandsons are torn asunder by the strife
 quid si intendatur certamen tali coniugio$$ What will happen if the rivalry is rendered more intense by such a marriage
 falleris enim , Seiane , si te mansurum in eodem ordine putas , et Liviam , quae G Caesari , mox Druso nupta fuerit , ea mente acturam ut cum equite Romano senescat$$ For you are mistaken ,  Sejanus ,  if you think that you will then remain in the same position ,  and that Livia ,  who has been the wife of Caius Caesar and afterwards of Drusus ,  will have the inclination to pass her old age with a mere Roman knight

 Caesar obiectam sibi adversus reos inclementiam eo pervicacius amplexus , Aquiliam adulterii delatam cum Vario Ligure , quamquam Lentulus Gaetulicus consul designatus lege Iulia damnasset , exilio punivit Apidiumque Merulam quod in acta divi Augusti non iuraverat albo senatorio erasit$$ but the emperor ,  clinging all the more obstinately to the harshness with which he had been reproached in regard to accused persons ,  punished Aquilia with exile for the crime of adultery with Varius Ligur ,  although Lentulus Gaetulicus ,  the consul-elect ,  had proposed that she should be sentenced under the Julian law He next struck off Apidius Merula from the register of the Senate for not having sworn obedience to the legislation of the Divine Augustus

 frustra Pulchram praescribi cui sola exitii causa sit quod Agrippinam stulte prorsus ad cultum delegerit oblita Sosiae ob eadem adflictae$$ Pulchra's name is a mere blind the only reason for her destruction is that she has ,  in utter folly ,  selected Agrippina for her admiration ,  forgetting that Sosia was thereby ruined

 simul Lucius Sullam testem adferebant , gravissimo in discrimine exercitus ob asperitatem hiemis et penuriam vestis , cum id Zmyrnam in contionem nuntiatum foret , omnis qui adstabant detraxisse corpori tegmina nostrisque legionibus misisse$$ They appealed too to the of Lucius Sulla ,  whose army was once in terrible jeopardy from a severe winter and want of clothing ,  and this having been announced at Smyrna in a public assembly ,  all who were present stript their clothes off their backs and sent them to our legions

 quippe illi praegracilis et incurva proceritas , nudus capillo vertex , ulcerosa facies ac plerumque medicaminibus interstincta$$ He had indeed a tall ,  singularly slender and stooping figure ,  a bald head ,  a face full of eruptions ,  and covered here and there with plasters

 adsimulabatque iudicis partis adversum Germanici stirpem , subditis qui accusatorum nomina sustinerent maximeque insectarentur Neronem proximum successioni et , quamquam modesta iuventa , plerumque tamen quid in praesentiarum conduceret oblitum , dum a libertis et clientibus , apiscendae potentiae properis , extimulator ut erectum et fidentem animi ostenderet velle id populum Romanum , cupere exercitus , neque ausurum contra Seianum qui nunc patientiam senis et segnitiam iuvenis iuxta insultet$$ He pretended to act as a judge towards the children of Germanicus ,  after having suborned persons to assume the part of prosecutors and to inveigh specially against Nero ,  next in succession to the throne ,  who ,  though he had proper youthful modesty ,  often forgot present expediency ,  while freedmen and clients ,  eager to get power ,  incited him to display vigour and self-confidence This ,  they said ,  was what the Roman people wished ,  what the armies desired ,  and Sejanus would not dare to oppose it ,  though now he insulted alike the tame spirit of the old emperor and the timidity of the young prince
 Haec atque talia audienti nihil quidempravae cogitationis , sed interdum voces procedebant contumaces et inconsultae , quas adpositi custodes exceptas auctasque cum deferrent neque Neroni defendere daretur , diversae insuper sollicitudinum formae oriebantur$$ Nero ,  while he listened to this and like talk ,  was not indeed inspired with any guilty ambition ,  but still occasionally there would break from him wilful and thoughtless expressions which spies about his person caught up and reported with exaggeration ,  and this he had no opportunity of rebutting
 nam alius occursum eius vitare , quidam salutatione reddita statim averti , plerique inceptum sermonem abrumpere , insistentibus contra inridentibusque qui Seiano fautores aderant$$ Then again alarms under various forms were continually arising One man would avoid meeting him another after returning his salutation would instantly turn away many after beginning a conversation would instantly break it off ,  while Sejanus's friends would stand their ground and laugh at him
 enimvero Tiberius torvus aut falsum renidens vultu$$ Tiberius indeed wore an angry frown or a treacherous smile
 seu loqueretur seu taceret iuvenis , crimen ex silentio , ex voce$$ Whether the young prince spoke or held his tongue ,  silence and speech were alike criminal
 ne nox quidem secura , cum uxor vigilias somnos suspiria matri Liviae atque illa Seiano patefaceret$$ Every night had its anxieties ,  for his sleepless hours ,  his dreams and sighs were all made known by his wife to her mother Livia and by Livia to Sejanus
 qui fratrem quoque Neronis Drusum traxit in partis , spe obiecta principis loci si priorem aetate et iam labefactum demovisset$$ Nero's brother Drusus Sejanus actually drew into his scheme by holding out to him the prospect of becoming emperor through the removal of an elder brother ,  already all but fallen
 atrox Drusi ingenium super cupidinem potentiae et solita fratribus odia accendebatur invidia quod mater Agrippina promptior Neroni erat$$ The savage temper of Drusus ,  to say nothing of lust of power and the usual feuds between brothers ,  was inflamed with envy by the partiality of the mother Agrippina towards Nero
 neque tamen Seianus ita Drusum fovabat ut non in eum quoque semina futuri exitii meditaretur , gnarus praeferocem et insidiis magis opportunum$$ And yet Sejanus ,  while he favoured Drusus ,  was not without thoughts of sowing the seeds of his future ruin ,  well knowing how very impetuous he was and therefore the more exposed to treachery
 Fine anni excessere insignes viri Asinius Agrippa , claris maioribus quam vetustis vitaque non degener , et Quintus Haterius , familia senatoria , eloquentiae quoad vixit celebratae monimenta ingeni eius haud perinde retinentur scilicet impetu magis quam cura vigebat$$ Towards the close of the year died two distinguished men ,  Asinius Agrippa and Quintus Haterius Agrippa was of illustrious rather than ancient ancestry ,  which his career did not disgrace Haterius was of a senatorian family and famous for his eloquence while he lived ,  though the monuments which remain of his genius are not admired as of old
 utque aliorum meditatio et labor in posterum valescit , sic Haterii canorum illud et profluens cum ipso simul extinctum est$$ The truth is he succeeded more by vehemence than by finish of style While the research and labours of other authors are valued by an after age ,  the harmonious fluency of Haterius died with him
 Marcus Licinio Lucius Calpurnio consulibus ingentium bellorum cladem aequavit malum improvisum$$ In the year of the consulship of Marcus Licinius and Lucius Calpurnius ,  the losses of a great war were matched by an unexpected disaster ,  no sooner begun than ended
 eius initium simul et finis extitit nam coepto apud Fidenam amphitheatro Atilius quidam libertini generis , quo spectaculum gladiatorum celebraret , neque fundamenta per solidum subdidit neque firmis nexibus ligneam compagem superstruxit , ut qui non abundantia pecuniae nec municipali ambitione sed in sordidam mercedem id negotium quaesivisset$$ One Atilius ,  of the freedman class ,  having undertaken to build an amphitheatre at Fidena for the exhibition of a show of gladiators ,  failed to lay a solid foundation to frame the wooden superstructure with beams of sufficient strength for he had neither an abundance of wealth ,  nor zeal for public popularity ,  but he had simply sought the work for sordid gain Thither flocked all who loved such sights and who during the reign of Tiberius had been wholly debarred from such amusements
 adfluxere avidi talium , imperitante Tiberio procul voluptatibus habiti , virile ac muliebre secus , omnis aetas , ob propinquitatem loci effusius$$ men and women of every age crowding to the place because it was near Rome And so the calamity was all the more fatal
 unde gravior pestis fuit , conferta mole , dein convulsa , dum ruit intus aut in exteriora effunditur immensamque vim mortalium , spectaculo intentos aut qui circum adstabant , praeceps trahit atque operit$$ The building was densely crowded then came a violent shock ,  as it fell inwards or spread outwards ,  precipitating and burying an immense multitude which was intently gazing on the show or standing round
 et illi quidem quos principium stragis in mortem adflixerat , ut tali sorte , cruciatum effugere$$ Those who were crushed to death in the first moment of the accident had at least under such dreadful circumstances the advantage of escaping torture
 miserandi magis quos abrupta parte corporis nondum vita deseruerat qui per diem visu , per noctem ululatibus et gemitu coniuges aut liberos noscebant$$ More to be pitied were they who with limbs torn from them still retained life ,  while they recognised their wives and children by seeing them during the day and by hearing in the night their screams and groans
 iam ceteri fama exciti , hic fratrem , propinquum ille , alius parentes lamentari$$ Soon all the neighbours in their excitement at the report were bewailing brothers ,  kinsmen or parents
 etiam quorum diversa de causa amici aut necessarii aberant , pavere tamen nequedum comperto quos illa vis perculisset , latior ex incerto metus$$ Even those whose friends or relatives were away from home for quite a different reason ,  still trembled for them ,  and as it was not yet known who had been destroyed by the crash ,  suspense made the alarm more widespread
 Nondum ea clades exoleverat cum ignis violentia urbem ultra solitum adfecit , deusto monte Caelio$$ This disaster was not forgotten when a furious conflagration damaged the capital to an unusual extent ,  reducing Mount Caelius to ashes
 feralemque annum ferebant et ominibus adversis susceptum principi consilium absentiae , qui mos vulgo , fortuita ad culpam trahentes , ni Caesar obviam isset tribuendo pecunias ex modo detrimenti$$ It was an ill-starred year ,  people began to say ,  and the emperor's purpose of leaving Rome must have been formed under evil omens They began in vulgar fashion to trace ill-luck to guilt ,  when Tiberius checked them by distributing money in proportion to losses sustained
 actaeque ei grates apud senatum ab inlustribus famaque apud populum , quia sine ambitione aut proximorum precibus ignotos etiam et ultro accitos munificentia iuverat$$ He received a vote of thanks in the Senate from its distinguished members ,  and was applauded by the populace for having assisted with his liberality ,  without partiality or the solicitations of friends ,  strangers whom he had himself sought out
 adduntur sententiae ut mons Caelius in posterum Augustus appellaretur , quando cunctis circum flagrantibus sola Tiberii effigies sita in domo Iunii senatoris inviolata mansisset$$ And proposals were also made that Mount Caelius should for the future be called Mount Augustus ,  inasmuch as when all around was in flames only a single statue of Tiberius in the house of one Junius ,  a senator ,  had remained uninjured
 evenisse id olim Claudiae Quintae eiusque statuam vim ignium bis elapsam maiores apud aedem matris deum consecravisse$$ This ,  it was said ,  had formerly happened to Claudia Quinta her statue ,  which had twice escaped the violence of fire ,  had been dedicated by our ancestors in the temple of the Mother of Gods
 sanctos acceptosque numinibus Claudios et augendam caerimoniam loco in quo tantum in principem honorem di ostenderint$$ hence the Claudii had been accounted sacred and numbered among deities ,  and so additional sanctity ought to be given to a spot where heaven showed such honour to the emperor
 At Caesar dedicatis per Campaniam templis , quamquam edicto monuisset ne quis quietem eius inrumperet , concursusque oppidanorum disposito milite prohiberentur , perosus tamen municipia et colonias omniaque in continenti sita Capreas se in insulam abdidit trium milium freto ab extremis Surrentini promunturii diiunctam$$ Caesar ,  meanwhile ,  after dedicating the temples in Campania ,  warned the public by an edict not to disturb his retirement and posted soldiers here and there to keep off the throngs of townsfolk But he so loathed the towns and colonies and ,  in short ,  every place on the mainland ,  that he buried himself in the island of Capreae which is separated by three miles of strait from the extreme point of the promontory of Sorrentum
 solitudinem eius placuisse maxime crediderim , quoniam importuosum circa mare et vix modicis navigiis pauca subsidia$$ The solitude of the place was ,  I believe ,  its chief attraction ,  for a harbourless sea surrounds it and even for a small vessel it has but few safe retreats ,  nor can any one land unknown to the sentries
 neque adpulerit quisquam nisi gnaro custode$$ Its air in winter is soft ,  as it is screened by a mountain which is a protection against cutting winds
 caeli temperies hieme mitis obiectu montis quo saeva ventorum arcentur$$ In summer it catches the western breezes ,  and the open sea round it renders it most delightful
 aestas in favonium obversa et aperto circum pelago peramoena$$ It commanded too a prospect of the most lovely bay ,  till Vesuvius ,  bursting into flames ,  changed the face of the country
 prospectabatque pulcherrimum sinum , antequam Vesuvius mons ardescens faciem loci verteret$$ Greeks ,  so tradition says ,  occupied those parts and Capreae was inhabited by the Teleboi
 Graecos ea tenuisse Capreasque Telebois habitatas fama tradit$$ Tiberius had by this time filled the island with twelve country houses ,  each with a grand name and a vast structure of its own
 sed tum Tiberius duodecim villarum nominibus et molibus insederat , quanto intentus olim publicas ad curas tanto occultiores in luxus et malum otium resolutus$$ Intent as he had once been on the cares of state ,  he was now for thoroughly unbending himself in secret profligacy and a leisure of malignant schemes
 manebat quippe suspicionum et credendi temeritas quam Seianus augere etiam in urbe suetus acrius turbabat non iam occultis adversum Agrippinam et Neronem insidiis$$ For he still retained that rash proneness to suspect and to believe ,  which even at Rome Sejanus used to foster ,  and which he here excited more keenly ,  no longer concealing his machinations against Agrippina and Nero
 quis additus miles nuntios , introitus , aperta secreta velut in annalis referebat , ultroque struebantur qui monerent perfugere ad Germaniae exercitus vel celeberrimo fori effigiem divi Augusti amplecti populumque ac senatum auxilio vocare$$ Soldiers hung about them ,  and every message ,  every visit ,  their public and their private life were I may say regularly chronicled And persons were actually suborned to advise them to flee to the armies of Germany ,  or when the Forum was most crowded ,  to clasp the statue of statue of the Divine Augustus and appeal to the protection of the people and Senate
 eaque spreta ab illis , velut pararent , obiciebantur$$ These counsels they disdained ,  but they were charged with having had thoughts of acting on them
 Consultant quos memoravi quonam modo ea plurium auditu acciperentur$$ The men whom I have named now consulted how these conversations might fall within the hearing of more persons
 nam loco in quem coibatur servanda solitudinis facies et si pone foris adsisterent , metus visus , sonitus aut forte ortae suspicionis erat$$ It was necessary that the place of meeting should preserve the appearance of secrecy ,  and ,  if witnesses were to stand behind the doors ,  there was a fear of their being seen or heard ,  or of suspicion casually arising
 tectum inter et laquearia tres senatores haud minus turpi latebra quam detestanda fraude sese abstrudunt , foraminibus et rimis aurem admovent$$ Three senators thrust themselves into the space between the roof and ceiling ,  a hiding-place as shameful as the treachery was execrable
 interea Latiaris repertum in publico Sabinum , velut recens cognita narraturus , domum et in cubiculum trahit praeteritaque et instantia , quorum adfatim copia , ac novos terrores cumulat$$ They applied their ears to apertures and crevices Latiaris meanwhile having met Sabinus in the streets ,  drew him to his house and to the room ,  as if he was going to communicate some fresh discoveries
 eadem ille et s diutius , quanto maesta , ubi semel prorupere , difficilius reticentur$$ There he talked much about past and impending troubles ,  a copious topic indeed ,  and about fresh horrors
 properata inde accusatio missisque ad Caesarem litteris ordinem fraudis suumque ipsi dedecus narravere$$ Sabinus spoke as before and at greater length ,  as sorrow ,  when once it has broken into utterance ,  is the harder to restrain
 non alias magis anxia et pavens civitas , tegens adversum proximos$$ Instantly they hastened to accuse him ,  and having despatched a letter to the emperor ,  they informed him of the order of the plot and of their own infamy
 congressus , conloquia , notae ignotaeque aures vitari$$ Never was Rome more distracted and terror-stricken
 etiam muta atque inanima , tectum et parietes circumspectabantur$$ Meetings ,  conversations ,  the ear of friend and stranger were alike shunned
 Sed Caesar sollemnia incipientis anni kalendis Ianuariis epistula precatus vertit in Sabinum , corruptos quosdam libertorum et petitum se arguens , ultionemque haud obscure poscebat$$ The emperor in his letter on the first of January ,  after offering the usual prayers for the new year ,  referred to Sabinus ,  whom he reproached with having corrupted some of his freedmen and having attempted his life ,  and he claimed vengeance in no obscure language
 nec mora quin decerneretur et trahebatur damnatus , quantum obducta veste et adstrictis faucibus niti poterat , clamitans sic inchoari annum , has Seiano victimas cadere$$ It was decreed without hesitation ,  and the condemned man was dragged off ,  exclaiming as loudly as he could ,  with head covered and throat tightly bound ,  that this was inaugurating the year
 quo intendisset oculos , quo verba acciderent , fuga vastitas , deseri itinera fora$$ these were the victims slain to Sejanus Wherever he turned his eyes ,  wherever his words fell ,  there was flight and solitude
 et quidam regrediebantur ostentabantque se rursum id ipsum paventes quod timuissent$$ the streets and public places were forsaken
 quem enim diem vacuum poena ubi inter sacra et vota , quo tempore verbis etiam profanis abstineri mos esset , vincla et laqueus inducantur$$ A few retraced their steps and again showed themselves ,  shuddering at the mere fact that they had betrayed alarm
 non imprudentem Tiberium tantam invidiam adisse quaesitum meditatumque , ne quid impedire credatur quo minus novi magistratus , quo modo delubra et altaria , sic carcerem recludant$$ What day ,  they asked ,  will be without some execution ,  when amid sacrifices and prayers ,  a time when it is usual to refrain even from a profane word ,  the chain and halter are introduced
 secutae insuper litterae grates agentis quod hominem infensum rei publicae punivissent , adiecto trepidam sibi vitam , suspectas inimicorum insidias , nullo nominatim compellato$$ Tiberius has not incurred such odium blindly this is a studied device to make us believe that there is no reason why the new magistrates should not open the dungeons as well as the temple and the altars
 neque tamen dubitabatur in Neronem et Agrippinam intendi$$ Thereupon there came a letter of thanks to them for having punished a bitter foe to the State ,  and the emperor further added that he had an anxious life ,  that he apprehended treachery from enemies ,  but he mentioned no one by name
 Ni mihi destinatum foret suum quaeque in annum referre , avebat animus antire statimque memorare exitus quos Latinus atque Opsius ceterique flagitii eius repertores habuere , non modo postquam Gaius Caesar rerum potitus est sed incolumi Tiberio , qui scelerum ministros ut perverti ab aliis nolebat , ita plerumque satiatus et oblatis in eandem operam recentibus veteres et praegravis adflixit$$ But for my plan of referring each event to its own year ,  I should feel a strong impulse to anticipate matters and at once relate the deaths by which Latinius and Opsius and the other authors of this atrocious deed perished ,  some after Caius became emperor ,  some even while Tiberius yet ruled For although he would not have the instruments of his wickedness destroyed by others ,  he frequently ,  when he was tired of them ,  and fresh ones offered themselves for the same services ,  flung off the old ,  now become a mere incubus
 verum has atque alias sontium poenas in tempore trademus$$ But these and other punishments of guilty men I shall describe in due course
 tum censuit Asinius Gallus , cuius liberorum Agrippina matertera erat , petendum a principe ut metus suos senatui fateretur amoverique sineret$$ Asinius Gallus ,  to whose children Agrippina was aunt ,  then moved that the emperor should be requested to disclose his apprehensions to the Senate and allow their removal
 nullam acque Tiberius , ut rebatur , ex virtutibus suis quam dissimulationem diligebat$$ Of all his virtues ,  as he counted them ,  there was none on which Tiberius so prided himself as his ability to dissemble ,  and he was therefore the more irritated at an attempt to expose what he was hiding
 eo aegrius accepit recludi quae premeret sed mitigavit Seianus , non Galli amore verum ut cunctationes principis opperiretur , gnarus lentum in meditando , ubi prorupisset , tristibus dictis atrocia facta coniungere$$ Sejanus however pacified him ,  not out of love for Gallus ,  but rather to wait the result of the emperor's wavering mood ,  knowing ,  as he did ,  that ,  though slow in forming his purpose ,  yet having once broken through his reserve ,  he would follow up harsh words with terrible deeds
 Per idem tempus Iulia mortem obiit , quam neptem Augustus convictam adulterii damnaverat proieceratque in insulam Trimentm , haud procul Apulis litoribus$$ About the same time Julia died ,  the granddaughter of Augustus He had condemned her on a conviction of adultery and had banished her to the island of Trimerus ,  not far from the shores of Apulia
 illic viginti annis exilium toleravit Augustae ope sustentata , quae florentis privignos cum per occultum subvertisset , misericordiam erga adflictos palam ostentabat$$ There she endured a twenty years' exile ,  in which she was supported by relief from Augusta ,  who having overthrown the prosperity of her step-children by secret machinations ,  made open display of her compassion to the fallen family
 Clarum inde inter Germanos Frisium nomen , dissimulante Tiberio damna ne cui bellum permitteret$$ The Frisian name thus became famous in Germany ,  and Tiberius kept our losses a secret ,  not wishing to entrust any one with the war
 neque senatus in eo cura an imperii extrema dehonestarentur$$ Nor did the Senate care whether dishonour fell on the extreme frontiers of the empire
 pavor internus occupaverat animos cui remedium adulatione quaerebatur$$ Fear at home had filled their hearts ,  and for this they sought relief in sycophancy
 ita quamquam diversis super rebus consulerentur , aram clementiae , aram amicitiae effigiesque circum Caesaris ac Seiani censuere crebrisque precibus efflagitabant visendi sui copiam facerent$$ And so ,  although their advice was asked on totally different subjects ,  they decreed an altar to Clemency ,  an altar to Friendship ,  and statues round them to Caesar and Sejanus ,  both of whom they earnestly begged with repeated entreaties to allow themselves to be seen in public
 non illi tamen in urbem aut propinqua urbi degressi sunt$$ Still ,  neither of them would visit Rome or even the neighbourhood of Rome
 satis visum omittere insulam et in proximo Campaniae aspici$$ they thought it enough to quit the island and show themselves on the opposite shores of Campania
 eo venire patres , eques , magna pars plebis , anxii erga Seianum cuius durior congressus atque eo per ambitum et societate consiliorum parabatur$$ Senators ,  knights ,  a number of the city populace flocked thither ,  anxiously looking to Sejanus ,  approach to whom was particularly difficult and was consequently sought by intrigue and by complicity in his counsels
 satis constabat auctam ei adrogantiam foedum illud in propatulo servitium spectanti$$ It was sufficiently clear that his arrogance was increased by gazing on this foul and openly displayed servility
 quippe Romae sueti discursus et magnitudine urbis incertum quod quisque ad negotium pergat$$ At Rome indeed hurrying crowds are a familiar sight ,  from the extent of the city no one knows on what business each citizen is bent
 ibi campo aut litore iacentes nullo discrimine noctem ac diem iuxta gratiam aut fastus ianitorum perpetiebantur donec id quoque vetitum et revenere in urbem trepidi quos non sermone , non visu dignatus erat , quidam male alacres quibus infaustae amicitiae gravis exitus imminebat$$ but there ,  as they lounged in promiscuous crowds in the fields or on the shore ,  they had to bear day and night alike the patronising smiles and the supercilious insolence of hall-porters ,  till even this was forbidden them ,  and those whom Sejanus had not deigned to accost or to look on ,  returned to the capital in alarm ,  while some felt an evil joy ,  though there hung over them the dreadful doom of that ill-starred friendship
 Rubellio et Fufio consulibus , quorum utrique Geminus cognomentum erat , Iulia Augusta mortem obiit , aetate s extrema , nobilitatis per Claudiam familiam et adoptione Liviorum Iuliorumque clarissimae$$ IN the consulship of Rubellius and Fufius ,  both of whom had the surname Geminus ,  died in an advanced old age Julia Augusta A Claudia by birth and by adoption a Livia and a Julia ,  she united the noblest blood of Rome
 primum ei matrimonium et liberi fuere cum Tiberio Nerone , qui bello Perusino profugus pace inter Sex Pompeium ac triumviros pacta in urbem rediit$$ Her first marriage ,  by which she had children ,  was with Tiberius Nero ,  who ,  an exile during the Perusian war ,  returned to Rome when peace had been concluded between Sextus Pompeius and the triumvirs
 exim Caesar cupidine formae aufert marito , incertum an invitam , adeo properus ut ne spatio quidem ad enitendum dato penatibus suis gravidam induxerit$$ After this Caesar ,  enamoured of her beauty ,  took her away from her husband ,  whether against her wish is uncertain So impatient was he that he brought her to his house actually pregnant ,  not allowing time for her confinement
 nullam posthac subolem edidit sed sanguini Augusti per coniunctionem Agrippinae et Germanici adnexa communis pronepotes habuit$$ She had no subsequent issue ,  but allied as she was through the marriage of Agrippina and Germanicus to the blood of Augustus ,  her great-grandchildren were also his
 sanctitate domus priscum ad morem , comis ultra quam antiquis feminis probatum , mater impotens , uxor facilis et cum artibus mariti , simulatione filii bene composita$$ In the purity of her home life she was of the ancient type ,  but was more gracious than was thought fitting in ladies of former days An imperious mother and an amiable wife ,  she was a match for the diplomacy of her husband and the dissimulation of her son
 funus eius modicum , testamen tum diu inritum fuit$$ Her funeral was simple ,  and her will long remained unexecuted
 Iaudata est pro rostris a G Caesare pronepote qui mox rerum potitus est$$ Her panegyric was pronounced from the Rostra by her great-grandson ,  Caius Caesar ,  who afterwards succeeded to power
 At Tiberius , quod supremis in matrem officiis defuisset , nihil mutata amoenitate vitae , magnitudinem negotiorum per litteras excusavit honoresque memoriae eius ab senatu large decretos quasi per modestiam imminuit , paucis admodum receptis et addito ne caelestis religio decerneretur$$ Tiberius however ,  making no change in his voluptuous life ,  excused himself by letter for his absence from his last duty to his mother on the ground of the pressure of business He even abridged ,  out of moderation ,  as it seemed ,  the honours which the Senate had voted on a lavish scale to her memory ,  allowing only a very few ,  and adding that no religious worship was to be decreed ,  this having been her own wish
 sic ipsam maluisse quin et parte eiusdem epistulae increpuit amicitias muliebris , Fufium consulem oblique perstringens$$ In a part of the same letter he sneered at female friendships ,  with an indirect censure on the consul Fufius ,  who had risen to distinction through Augusta's partiality
 is gratia Augustae floruerat , aptus adliciendis feminarum animis , dicax idem et Tiberium acerbis facetiis inridere solitus quarum apud praepotentis in longum memoria est$$ Fufius was indeed a man well fitted to win the affection of a woman he was witty too ,  and accustomed to ridicule Tiberius with those bitter jests which the powerful remember so long
 Fuit in senatu Iunius Rusticus , componendis patrum actis delectus a Caesare eoque meditationes eius introspicere creditus$$ There was in the Senate one Junius Rusticus ,  who having been appointed by the emperor to register its debates was therefore supposed to have an insight into his secret purposes
 is fatali quodam motu (neque enim ante specimen constantiae dederat) seu prava sollertia , dum imminentium oblitus incerta pavet , inserere se dubitantibus ac monere consules ne relationem inciperent$$ This man ,  whether through some fatal impulse (he had indeed never before given any evidence of courage) or a misdirected acuteness which made him tremble at the uncertain future ,  while he forgot impending perils ,  attached himself to the waverers ,  and warned the consuls not to enter on the debate
 disserebatque brevibus momentis summa verti posse quandoque domus Germanici exitium paenitentiae esse seni$$ He argued that the highest issues turned on trivial causes ,  and that the fall of the house of Germanicus might one day move the old man's remorse
 simul populus effgies Agrippinae ac Neronis gerens circumsistit curiam faustisque in Caesarem ominibus falsas litteras et principe invito exitium domui eius intendi clamitat$$ At the same moment the people ,  bearing the images of Agrippina and Nero ,  thronged round the Senate-house ,  and ,  with words of blessing on the emperor ,  kept shouting that the letter was a forgery and that it was not by the prince's will that ruin was being plotted against his house
 ita nihil triste illo die patratum$$ And so that day passed without any dreadful result
 ferebantur etiam sub nominibus consularium fictae in Seianum sententiae , exercentibus plerisque per occultum atque eo procacius libidinem ingeniorum$$ Fictitious speeches too against Sejanus were published under the names of ex-consuls ,  for several persons indulged ,  all the more recklessly because anonymously ,  the caprice of their imaginations
 unde illi ira violentior et materies criminandi$$ Consequently the wrath of Sejanus was the more furious ,  and he had ground for alleging that the Senate disregarded the emperor's trouble

 Igitur Caesar repetitis adversum nepotem et nurum probris increpitaque per edictum plebe , questus apud patres quod fraude unius senatoris imperatoria maiestas elusa publice foret , integra tamen sibi cuncta postulavit$$ Upon this the emperor ,  after repeating his invectives against his grandson and his daughter-in-law and reprimanding the populace in an edict complained to the Senate that by the trick of one senator the imperial dignity had been publicly flouted ,  and he insisted that ,  after all ,  the whole matter should be left to his exclusive decision
 nec ultra deliberatum quo minus non quidem extrema decernerent (id enim vetitum) , sed paratos ad ultionem vi principis impediri testarentur $$ Without further deliberation ,  they proceeded ,  not indeed to pronounce the final sentence (for this was forbidden) ,  but to declare that they were prepared for vengeance ,  and were restrained only by the strong hand of the sovereign

 $$
 $$
 Quattuor et quadraginta orationes super ea re habitae , ex quis ob metum paucae , plures adsuetudine $$ forty-four speeches were delivered on this subject ,  a few of which were prompted by fear ,  most by the habit of flattery
 $$
 $$
 $$
   mihi pudorem aut Seiano invidiam adlaturum censui versa est fortuna et ille quidem qui collegam et generum adsciverat sibi ignoscit ceteri quem per dedecora fovere cum scelere insectantur$$ There is now a change of fortune ,  and even he who chose Sejanus to be his colleague and his son-in-law excuses his error As for the rest ,  the man whom they encouraged by shameful baseness ,  they now wickedly revile
 miserius sit ob amicitiam accusari an amicum accusare haud discreverim$$ Which is the most pitiable ,  to be accused for friendship's sake or to have to accuse a friend ,  I cannot decide
 non crudelitatem , non clementiam cuiusquam experiar sed liber et mihi ipsi probatus antibo periculum$$ I will not put any man's cruelty or compassion to the test ,  but ,  while I am free and have a clear conscience ,  I will anticipate peril
 vos obtestor ne memoriam nostri per maerorem quam laeti retineatis , adiciendo me quoque iis qui fine egregio publica mala effugerunt$$ I implore you to cherish my memory with joy rather than with sorrow ,  numbering me too with those who by noble death have fled from the miseries of our country
 Placitum posthac ut in reliquos Seiani liberos adverteretur , vanescente quamquam plebis ira ac plerisque per priora supplicia lenitis$$ It was next decided to punish the remaining children of Sejanus ,  though the fury of the populace was subsiding ,  and people generally had been appeased by the previous executions
 igitur portantur in carcerem , filius imminentium intellegens , puella adeo nescia ut crebro interrogaret quod ob delictum et quo traheretur neque facturam ultra et posse se puerili verbere moneri$$ Accordingly they were carried off to prison ,  the boy ,  aware of his impending doom ,  and the little girl ,  who was so unconscious that she continually asked what was her offence ,  and whither she was being dragged ,  saying that she would do so no more ,  and a childish chastisement was enough for her correction
 tradunt temporis eius auctores , quia triumvirali supplicio adfici virginem inauditum habebatur , a carnifice laqueum iuxta compressam$$ Historians of the time tell us that ,  as there was no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin ,  she was violated by the executioner ,  with the rope on her neck
 exim oblisis faucibus id aetatis corpora in Gemonias abiecta$$ Then they were strangled and their bodies ,  mere children as they were ,  were flung down the Gemoniae
 Per idem tempus Asia atque Achaia exterritae sunt acri magis quam diuturno rumore , Drusum Germanici filium apud Cycladas insulas mox in continenti visum$$ About the same time Asia and Achaia were alarmed by a prevalent but short-lived rumour that Drusus ,  the son of Germanicus ,  had been seen in the Cyclades and subsequently on the mainland
 et erat iuvenis haud dispari aetate , quibusdam Caesaris libertis velut adgnitus$$ There was indeed a young man of much the same age ,  whom some of the emperor's freedmen pretended to recognise ,  and to whom they attached themselves with a treacherous intent
 per dolumque comitantibus adliciebantur ignari fama nominis et promptis Graecorum animis ad nova et mira$$ The renown of the name attracted the ignorant ,  and the Greek mind eagerly fastens on what is new and marvellous
 quippe elapsum custodiae pergere ad paternos exercitus , Aegyptum aut Syriam invasurum , fingebant simul credebantque$$ The story indeed ,  which they no sooner invented than believed ,  was that Drusus had escaped from custody ,  and was on his way to the armies of his father ,  with the design of invading Egypt or Syria
 iam iuventutis concursu , iam publicis studiis frequentabatur , laetus praesentibus et inanium spe , cum auditum id Poppaeo Sabino$$ And he was now drawing to himself a multitude of young men and much popular enthusiasm ,  enjoying the present and cherishing idle hopes of the future ,  when Poppaeus Sabinus heard of the affair
 is Macedoniae tum intentus Achaiam quoque curabat$$ At the time he was chiefly occupied with Macedonia ,  but he also had the charge of Achaia
 igitur quo vera seu falsa antiret Toronaeum Thermaeumque sinum praefestinans , mox Euboeam Aegaei maris insulam et Piraeum Atticae orae , dein Corinthiense litus angustiasque Isthmi evadit marique alio Nicopolim Romanam coloniam ingressus , ibi demum cognoscit sollertius interrogatum quisnam foret dixisse Marcus Silano genitum et multis sectatorum dilapsis ascendisse navem tamquam Italiam peteret$$ So ,  to forestall the danger ,  let the story be true or false ,  he hurried by the bays of Torone and Thermae ,  then passed on to Euboea ,  an island of the Aegaean ,  to Piraeus ,  on the coast of Attica ,  thence to the shores of Corinth and the narrow Isthmus ,  and having arrived by the other sea at Nicopolis ,  a Roman colony ,  he there at last ascertained that the man ,  when skilfully questioned ,  had said that he was the son of Marcus Silanus ,  and that ,  after the dispersion of a number of his followers' he had embarked on a vessel ,  intending ,  it seemed ,  to go to Italy
 scripsitque haec Tiberio neque nos originem finemve eius rei ultra comperimus$$ Sabinus sent this account to Tiberius ,  and of the origin and issue of the affair nothing more is known to me
 Exim Cotta Messalinus , saevissimae cuiusque sen tentiae auctor eoque inveterata invidia , ubi primum facultas data arguitur pleraque Gaius Caesarem quasi incestae virilitatis , et cum die natali Augustae inter sacerdotes epularetur , novendialem eam cenam dixisse$$ Several charges were next brought ,  as soon as the opportunity offered ,  against Cotta Messalinus ,  the author of every unusually cruel proposal ,  and consequently ,  regarded with inveterate hatred He had spoken ,  it was said ,  of Caius Caesar ,  as if it were a question whether he was a man ,  and of an entertainment at which he was present on Augusta's birthday with the priests ,  as a funeral banquet
 querensque de potentia M Lepidi ac Lucius Arruntii , cum quibus ob rem pecuniariam disceptabat , addidisse$$ In remonstrating too against the influence of Marcus Lepidus and Lucius Arruntius ,  with whom he had disputes on many matters ,  he had added the remark ,  They will have the Senate's support
 illos quidem senatus , me autem tuebitur Tiberiolus meus$$ I shall have that of my darling Tiberius
 quae cuncta a primoribus civitatis revincebatur iisque instantibus ad imperatorem provocavit$$ But the leading men of the State failed to convict him on all the charges When they pressed the case ,  he appealed to the emperor
 nec multo post litterae adferuntur quibus in modum defensionis , repetito inter se atque Cottam amicitiae principio crebrisque eius officiis commemoratis , ne verba prave detorta neu convivalium fabularum simplicitas in crimen duceretur postulavit$$ Soon afterwards ,  a letter arrived ,  in which Tiberius traced the origin of the friendship between himself and Cotta ,  enumerated his frequent services ,  and then requested that words perversely misrepresented and the freedom of table talk might not be construed into a crime
 Insigne visum est earum Caesaris litterarum initium$$ The beginning of the emperor's letter seemed very striking
 nam his verbis exorsus est$$ It opened thus 
 quid scribam vobis , patres conscripti , aut quo modo scribam aut quid omnino non scribam hoc tempore , di me deaeque peius perdant quam perire me cotidie sentio , si scio$$  May all the gods and goddesses destroy me more miserably than I feel myself to be daily perishing ,  if I know at know at this moment what to write to you ,  Senators ,  how to write it ,  or what ,  in short ,  not to write
 adeo facinora atque flagitia sua ipsi quoque in supplicium verterant$$ So completely had his crimes and infamies recoiled ,  as a penalty ,  on himself
 neque frustra praestantissimus sapientiae firmare solitus est , si recludantur tyrannorum mentes , posse aspici laniatus et ictus , quando ut corpora verberibus , ita saevitia , libidine , malis consultis animus dilaceretur$$ With profound meaning was it often affirmed by the greatest teacher of philosophy that ,  could the minds of tyrants be laid bare ,  there would be seen gashes and wounds for ,  as the body is lacerated by scourging ,  so is the spirit by brutality ,  by lust and by evil thoughts
 quippe Tiberium non fortuna , non solitudines protegebant quin tormenta pectoris suasque ipse poenas fateretur$$ Assuredly Tiberius was not saved by his elevation or his solitude from having to confess the anguish of his heart and his self-inflicted punishment
 Tum facta patribus potestate statuendi de Caeciliano senatore qui plurima adversum Cottam prompserat , placitum eandem poenam inrogari quam in Aruseium et Sanquinium , accusatores Lucius Arruntii$$ Authority was then given to the Senate to decide the case of Caecilianus ,  one of its members ,  the chief witness against Cotta ,  and it was agreed that the same penalty should be inflicted as on Aruseius and Sanquinius ,  the accusers of Lucius Arruntius
 quo non aliud honorificentius Cottae evenit , qui nobilis quidem set egens ob luxum , per flagitia infamis , sanctissimis Arruntii artibus dignitate ultionis aequabatur$$ Nothing ever happened to Cotta more to his distinction Of noble birth ,  but beggared by extravagance and infamous for his excesses ,  he was now by dignity of his revenge ,  raised to a level with the stainless virtues of Arruntius
 Quintus Servaeus posthac et Minucius Thermus inducti , Servaeus praetura functus et quondam Germanici comes , Minucius equestri loco , modeste habita Seiani amicitia$$ Quintus Servaeus and Minucius Thermus were next arraigned Servaeus was an ex-praetor ,  and had formerly been a companion of Germanicus
 unde illis maior miseratio$$ Minucius was of equestrian rank ,  and both had enjoyed ,  though discreetly ,  the friendship of Sejanus
 contra Tiberius praecipuos ad scelera increpans admonuit Gaius Cestium patrem dicere senatui quae sibi scripisset , suscepitque Cestius accusationem$$ Hence they were the more pitied Tiberius ,  on the contrary ,  denounced them as foremost in crime ,  and bade Caius Cestius ,  the elder ,  tell the Senate what he had communicated to the emperor by letter
 quod maxime exitiabile tulere illa tempora , cum primores senatus infimas etiam delationes exercerent , alii propalam , multi per occultum$$ Cestius undertook the prosecution And this was the most dreadful feature of the age ,  that leading members of the Senate ,  some openly ,  some secretly employed themselves in the very lowest work of the informer
 neque discerneres alienos a coniunctis , amicos ab ignotis , quid repens aut vetustate obscurum$$ One could not distinguish between aliens and kinsfolk ,  between friends and strangers ,  or say what was quite recent ,  or what half-forgotten from lapse of time
 perinde in foro , in convivio , quaqua de re locuti incusabantur , ut quis praevenire et reum destinare properat , pars ad subsidium sui , plures infecti quasi valetudine et contactu$$ People were incriminated for some casual remark in the forum or at the dinner-table ,  for every one was impatient to be the first to mark his victim ,  some to screen themselves ,  most from being ,  as it were ,  infected with the contagion of the malady
 sed Minu cius et Servaeus damnati indicibus accessere$$ Minucius and Servaeus ,  on being condemned ,  went over to the prosecution ,  and then Julius Africanus with Seius Quadratus were dragged into the same ruin
 tractique sunt in casum eundem Iulius Africanus e Santonis Gallica civitate , Seius Quadratus$$ Africanus was from the Santones ,  one of the states of Gaul
 originem non repperi$$ the origin of Quadratus I have not ascertained
 neque sum ignarus a plerisque scriptoribus omissa multorum pericula et poenas , dum copia fatiscunt aut quae ipsis nimia et maesta fuerant ne pari taedio lecturos adficerent verentur$$ Many authors ,  I am well aware ,  have passed over the perils and punishments of a host of persons ,  sickened by the multiplicity of them ,  or fearing that what they had themselves found wearisome and saddening would be equally fatiguing to their readers
 nobis pleraque digna cognitu obvenere , quamquam ab aliis incelebrata$$ For myself ,  I have lighted on many facts worth knowing ,  though other writers have not recorded them
 Nam ea tempestate qua Seiani amicitiam ceteri falso exuerant ausus est eques Romanus Marcus Terentius , ob id reus , amplecti , ad hunc modum apud senatum ordiendo$$ A Roman knight ,  Marcus Terentius ,  at the crisis when all others had hypocritically repudiated the friendship of Sejanus ,  dared ,  when impeached on that ground ,  to cling to it by the following avowal to the Senate 
 fortunae quidem meae fortasse minus expediat adgnoscere crimen quam abnuere$$  In my position it is perhaps less to my advantage to acknowledge than to deny the charge
 sed utcumque casura res est , fatebor et fuisse me Seiano amicum et ut essem expetisse et postquam adeptus eram laetatum$$ Still ,  whatever is to be the issue of the matter ,  I shall admit that I was the friend of Sejanus ,  that I anxiously sought to be such ,  and was delighted when I was successful
 videram collegam patris regendis praetoriis cohortibus , mox urbis et militiae munis simul obeuntem$$ I had seen him his father's colleague in the command of the praetorian cohorts ,  and subsequently combining the duties of civil and military life
 illius propinqui et adfines honoribus augebantur$$ His kinsfolk and connections were loaded with honours
 ut quisque Seiano intimus ita ad Caesaris amicitiam validus$$ intimacy with Sejanus was in every case a powerful recommendation to the emperor's friendship
 contra quibus infensus esset , metu ac sordibus conflictabantur$$ Those ,  on the contrary ,  whom he hated ,  had to struggle with danger and humiliation
 nec quemquam exemplo adsumo$$ I take no individual as an instance
 cunctos qui novissimi consilii expertes fuimus meo unius discrimine defendam$$ All of us who had no part in his last design ,  I mean to defend at the peril of myself alone
 non enim Seianum Vulsiniensem set Claudiae et Iuliae domus partem , quas adfinitate occu paverat , tuum , Caesar , generum , tui consulatus socium , tua officia in re publica capessentem colebamus$$ It was really not Sejanus of Vulsinii ,  it was a member of the Claudian and Julian houses ,  in which he had taken a position by his marriage-alliance ,  it was your son-in-law ,  Caesar ,  your partner in the consulship ,  the man who administered your political functions ,  whom we courted
 non est nostrum aestimare quem supra ceteros et quibus de causis extollas$$ It is not for us to criticise one whom you may raise above all others ,  or your motives for so doing
 tibi summum rerum iudicium di dedere , nobis obsequii gloria relicta est$$ Heaven has intrusted you with the supreme decision of affairs ,  and for us is left the glory of obedience
 spectamus porro quae coram habentur , cui ex te opes honores , quis plurima iuvandi nocendive potentia , quae Seiano fuisse nemo negaverit$$ And ,  again ,  we see what takes place before our eyes ,  who it is on whom you bestow riches and honours ,  who are the most powerful to help or to injure
 abditos principis sensus et si quid occultius parat exquirere inlicitum , anceps$$ That Sejanus was such ,  no one will deny
 nec ideo adsequare ne , patres conscripti , ultimum Seiani diem sed sedecim annos cogi taveritis$$ To explore the prince's secret thoughts ,  or any of his hidden plans ,  is a forbidden ,  a dangerous thing ,  nor does it follow that one could reach them
 etiam Satrium atque Pomponium venerabamur$$ Do not ,  Senators ,  think only of Sejanus's last day ,  but of his sixteen years of power
 libertis quoque ac ianitoribus eius notescere pro magnifico accipiebatur$$ We actually adored a Satrius and a Pomponius
 quid ergo$$ To be known even to his freedmen and hall-porters was thought something very grand
 indistincta haec defensio et promisca dabitur$$ What then is my meaning
 immo iustis terminis dividatur$$ Is this apology meant to be offered for all without difference and discrimination
 insidiae in rem publicam , consilia caedis adversum imperatorem puniantur$$ No
 de amicitia et officiis idem finis et te , Caesar , et nos absolverit$$ it is to be restricted within proper limits
 Constantia orationis et quia repertus erat qui efferret quae omnes animo agitabant eo usque potuere ut accusatores eius , additis quae ante deliquerant , exilio aut morte multarentur$$ The courage of this speech and the fact that there had been found a man to speak out what was in all people's thoughts ,  had such an effect that the accusers of Terentius were sentenced to banishment or death ,  their previous offences being taken into account
 Secutae dehinc Tiberii litterae in Sex Vistilium praetorium , quem Druso fratri percarum in cohortem suam transtulerat$$ Then came a letter from Tiberius against Sextus Vestilius ,  an ex-praetor ,  whom ,  as a special favourite of his brother Drusus ,  the emperor had admitted into his own select circle
 causa offensionis Vistilio fuit , seu composuerat quaedam in Gaium Caesarem ut impudicum , sive ficto habita fides$$ His reason for being displeased with Vestilius was that he had either written an attack on Caius Caesar as a profligate ,  or that Tiberius believed a false charge
 atque ob id convictu principis prohibitus cum senili manu ferrum temptavisset , obligat venas$$ For this Vestilius was excluded from the prince's table
 precatus que per codicillos , immiti rescripto venas resolvit acervatim ex eo Annius Pollio , Appius Silanus Scauro Mamerco simul ac Sabino Calvisio maiestatis postulantur , et Vinicianus Pollioni patri adiciebatur , clari genus et quidam summis honoribus contremuerantque patres (nam quotus quisque adfinitatis aut amicitiae tot inlustrium virorum expers erat$$ He then tried the knife with his aged hand ,  but again bound up his veins ,  opening them once more however on having begged for pardon by letter and received a pitiless answer After him a host of persons were charged with treason ,  Annius Pollio ,  Appius Silanus ,  Scaurus Mamercus ,  Sabinus Calvisius ,  Vinicianus too ,  coupled with Pollio ,  his father ,  men all of illustrious descent ,  some too of the highest political distinction
) , ni Celsus urbanae cohortis tribunus , tum inter indices , Appium et Calvisium discrimini exemisset Caesar Pollionis ac Viniciani Scaurique causam ut ipse cum senatu nosceret distulit , datis quibusdam in Scaurum tristibus notis$$ The senators were panic-stricken ,  for how few of their number were not connected by alliance or by friendship with this multitude of men of rank! Celsus however ,  tribune of a city cohort ,  and now one of the prosecutors ,  saved Appius and Calvisius from the peril
 Ne feminae quidem exsortes periculi$$ Even women were not exempt from danger
 quia occu pandae rei publicae argui non poterant , ob lacrimas incusabantur$$ Where they could not be accused of grasping at political power ,  their tears were made a crime
 necataque est anus Vitia , Fufii Gemini mater , quod filii necem flevisset$$ Vitia ,  an aged woman ,  mother of Fufius Geminus ,  was executed for bewailing the death of her son
 haec apud senatum$$ Such were the proceedings in the Senate
 nec secus apud principem Vescularius Flaccus ac Iulius Marinus ad mortem aguntur , e vetustissimis familiarium , Rhodum secuti et apud Capreas individui , Vescularius insidiarum in Libonem internuntius$$ It was the same with the emperor Vescularius Atticus and Julius Marinus were hurried off to execution ,  two of his oldest friends ,  men who had followed him to Rhodes and been his inseparable companions at Capreae
 Marino participe Seianus Curtium Atticum oppresserat$$ Vescularius was his agent in the plot against Libo ,  and it was with the co-operation of Marinus that Sejanus had ruined Curtius Atticus
 quo laetius acceptum sua exempla in consultores recidisse$$ Hence there was all the more joy at the recoil of these precedents on their authors
 Per idem tempus Lucius Piso pontifex , rarum in tanta claritudine , fato obiit , nullius servilis sententiae sponte auctor et quoties necessitas ingrueret sapienter moderans$$ About the same time Lucius Piso ,  the pontiff ,  died a natural death ,  a rare incident in so high a rank Never had he by choice proposed a servile motion ,  and ,  whenever necessity was too strong for him ,  he would suggest judicious compromises
 patrem ei censorium fuisse memoravi$$ His father ,  as I have related ,  had been a censor
 aetas ad octogesimum annum processit$$ He lived to the advanced age of eighty ,  and had won in Thrace the honour of a triumph
 decus triumphale in Thraecia meruerat sed praecipua ex eo gloria quod praefectus urbi recens continuam potestatem et insolentia parendi graviorem mire temperavit$$ But his chief glory rested on the wonderful tact with which as city-prefect he handled an authority ,  recently made perpetual and all the more galling to men unaccustomed to obey it
 Isdem consulibus gravitate annonae iuxta seditionem ventum multaque et pluris per dies in theatro licentius efflagitata quam solitum adversum imperatorem$$ During the same consulship a high price of corn almost brought on an insurrection For several days there were many clamorous demands made in the theatre with an unusual freedom of language towards the emperor
 quis commotus incusavit magistratus patresque quod non publica auctoritate populum coercuissent addiditque quibus ex provinciis et quanto maiorem quam Augustus rei frumentariae copiam advectaret$$ This provoked him to censure the magistrates and the Senate for not having used the authority of the State to put down the people He named too the corn-supplying provinces ,  and dwelt on the far larger amount of grain imported by himself than by Augustus
 ita castigandae plebi compositum senatus consultum prisca severitate neque segnius consules edixere$$ So the Senate drew up a decree in the severe spirit of antiquity ,  and the consuls issued a not less stringent proclamation
 silentium ipsius non civile , ut crediderat , sed in superbiam accipiebatur$$ The emperor's silence was not ,  as he had hoped ,  taken as a proof of patriotism ,  but of pride
 Ser Galba Lucius Sulla consulibus diu quaesito quos neptibus suis maritos destinaret Caesar , postquam instabat virginum aetas , Lucius Cassium , Marcus Vinicium legit$$ In the consulship of Servius Galba and Lucius Sulla ,  the emperor ,  after having long considered whom he was to choose to be husbands for his granddaughters ,  now that the maidens were of marriageable age ,  selected Lucius Cassius and Marcus Vinicius
 Vinicio oppidanum genus$$ Vinicius was of provincial descent
 Calibus ortus , patre atque avo consularibus , cetera equestri familia erat , mitis ingenio et comptae facundiae$$ he was born at Cales ,  his father and grandfather having been consuls ,  and his family ,  on the other side ,  being of the rank of knights
 Cassius plebeii Romae generis , verum antiqui honoratique , et severa patris disciplina eductus facilitate saepius quam industria commendabatur$$ He was a man of amiable temper and of cultivated eloquence Cassius was of an ancient and honourable ,  though plebeian house ,  at Rome Though he was brought up by his father under a severe training ,  he won esteem more frequently by his good-nature than by his diligence
 huic Drusillam , Vinicio Iuliam Germanico genitas coniungit superque ea re senatui scribit levi cum honore iuvenum$$ To him and to Vinicius the emperor married respectively Drusilla and Julia ,  Germanicus's daughters ,  and addressed a letter on the subject to the Senate ,  with a slightly complimentary mention of the young men
 dein redditis absentiae causis admodum vagis flexit ad graviora et offensiones ob rem publicam coeptas , utque Macro praefectus tribunorumque et centurionum pauci secum introirent quoties curiam ingrederetur petivit$$ He next assigned some very vague reasons for his absence ,  then passed to more important matters ,  the ill-will against him originating in his state policy ,  and requested that Macro ,  who commanded the praetorians ,  with a few tribunes and centurions ,  might accompany him whenever he entered the Senate-house
 factoque large et sine praescriptione generis aut numeri senatus consulto ne tecta quidem urbis , adeo publicum consilium numquam adiit , deviis plerumque itineribus ambiens patriam et declinans$$ But though a decree was voted by the Senate on a liberal scale and without any restrictions as to rank or numbers ,  he never so much as went near the walls of Rome ,  much less the State-council ,  for he would often go round and avoid his native city by circuitous routes
 Interea magna vis accusatorum in eos inrupit qui pecunias faenore auctitabant adversum legem dictatoris Caesaris qua de modo credendi possidendique intra Italiam caventur , omissam olim , quia privato usui bonum publicum postponitur$$ Meanwhile a powerful host of accusers fell with sudden fury on the class which systematically increased its wealth by usury in defiance of a law passed by Caesar the Dictator defining the terms of lending money and of holding estates in Italy ,  a law long obsolete because the public good is sacrificed to private interest
 sane vetus urbi faenebre malum et seditionum discordiarumque creberrima causa eoque cohibebatur antiquis quoque et minus corruptis moribus$$ The curse of usury was indeed of old standing in Rome and a most frequent cause of sedition and discord ,  and it was therefore repressed even in the early days of a less corrupt morality
 nam primo duodecim tabulis sanctum ne quis unciario faenore amplius exerceret , cum antea ex libidine locupletium agitaretur$$ First ,  the Twelve Tables prohibited any one from exacting more than 10 per cent ,  when ,  previously ,  the rate had depended on the caprice of the wealthy
 dein rogatione tribunicia ad semuncias redactum , postremo vetita versura$$ Subsequently ,  by a bill brought in by the tribunes ,  interest was reduced to half that amount ,  and finally compound interest was wholly forbidden
 multisque plebi scitis obviam itum fraudibus quae toties repressae miras per artes rursum oriebantur$$ A check too was put by several enactments of the people on evasions which ,  though continually put down ,  still ,  through strange artifices ,  reappeared
 sed tum Gracchus praetor , cui ea quaestio evenerat , multitudine periclitantium subactus rettulit ad senatum , trepidique patres (neque enim quisquam tali culpa vacuus) veniam a principe petivere$$ On this occasion ,  however ,  Gracchus ,  the praetor ,  to whose jurisdiction the inquiry had fallen ,  felt himself compelled by the number of persons endangered to refer the matter to the Senate In their dismay the senators ,  not one of whom was free from similar guilt ,  threw themselves on the emperor's indulgence
 et concedente annus in posterum sexque menses dati quis secundum iussa legis rationes familiaris quisque componerent$$ He yielded ,  and a year and six months were granted ,  within which every one was to settle his private accounts conformably to the requirements of the law
 Hinc inopia rei nummariae , commoto simul omnium aere alieno , et quia tot damnatis bonisque eorum divenditis signatum argentum fisco vel aerario attinebatur$$ Hence followed a scarcity of money ,  a great shock being given to all credit ,  the current coin too ,  in consequence of the conviction of so many persons and the sale of their property ,  being locked up in the imperial treasury or the public exchequer
 ad hoc senatus praescripserat , duas quisque faenoris partis in agris per Italiam conlocaret$$ To meet this ,  the Senate had directed that every creditor should have two-thirds his capital secured on estates in Italy
 sed creditores in solidum appellabant nec decorum appellatis minuere fidem$$ Creditors however were suing for payment in full ,  and it was not respectable for persons when sued to break faith
 ita primo concursatio et preces , dein strepere praetoris tribunal , eaque quae remedio quaesita , venditio et emptio , in contrarium mutari quia faeneratores omnem pecuniam mercandis agris condiderant$$ So ,  at first ,  there were clamorous meetings and importunate entreaties then noisy applications to the praetor's court And the very device intended as a remedy ,  the sale and purchase of estates ,  proved the contrary ,  as the usurers had hoarded up all their money for buying land
 copiam vendendi secuta vilitate , quanto quis obaeratior , aegrius distrahebant , multique fortunis provolvebantur$$ The facilities for selling were followed by a fall of prices ,  and the deeper a man was in debt ,  the more reluctantly did he part with his property ,  and many were utterly ruined
 eversio rei familiaris dignitatem ac famam praeceps dabat , donec tulit opem Caesar disposito per mensas milies sestertio factaque mutuandi copia sine usuris per triennium , si debitor populo in duplum praediis cavisset$$ The destruction of private wealth precipitated the fall of rank and reputation ,  till at last the emperor interposed his aid by distributing throughout the banks a hundred million sesterces ,  and allowing freedom to borrow without interest for three years ,  provided the borrower gave security to the State in land to double the amount
 sic refecta fides et paulatim privati quoque creditores reperti$$ Credit was thus restored ,  and gradually private lenders were found
 neque emptio agrorum exercita ad formam senatus consulti , acribus , ut ferme talia , initiis , incurioso fine$$ The purchase too of estates was not carried out according to the letter of the Senate's decree ,  rigour at the outset ,  as usual with such matters ,  becoming negligence in the end
 Dein redeunt priores metus postulato maiestatis Considio Proculo$$ Former alarms then returned ,  as there was a charge of treason against Considius Proculus
 qui nullo pavore diem natalem celebrans raptus in curiam pariterque damnatus interfectusque , et sorori eius Sanciae aqua atque igni interdictum accusante Quintus Pomponio is moribus inquies haec et huiusce modi a se factitari praetendebat ut parta apud principem gratia periculis Pomponii Secundi fratris mederetur$$ While he was celebrating his birthday without a fear ,  he was hurried before the Senate ,  condemned and instantly put to death His sister Sancia was outlawed ,  on the accusation of Quintus Pomponius ,  a restless spirit ,  who pretended that he employed himself in this and like practices to win favour with the sovereign ,  and thereby alleviate the perils hanging over his brother Pomponius Secundus
 etiam in Pompeiam Macrinam exilium statuitur cuius maritum Argolicum socerum Laconem e primoribus Achaeorum Caesar adflixerat$$ Pompeia Macrina too was sentenced to banishment Her husband Argolicus and her father-in-law Laco ,  leading men of Achaia ,  had been ruined by the emperor
 pater quoque inlustris eques Romanus ac frater praetorius , cum damnatio instaret , se ipsi interfecere$$ Her father likewise ,  an illustrious Roman knight ,  and her brother ,  an ex-praetor ,  seeing their doom was near ,  destroyed themselves
 datum erat crimini quod Theophanen Mytilenaeum proavum eorum Gnaeus Magnus inter intimos habuisset , quodque defuncto Theophani caelestis honores Graeca adulatio tribuerat$$ It was imputed to them as a crime that their great-grandfather Theophanes of Mitylene had been one of the intimate friends of Pompey the Great ,  and that after his death Greek flattery had paid him divine honours
 Sub idem tempus G Caesar , discedenti Capreas avo comes , Claudiam , Marcus Silani filiam , coniugio accepit , immanem animum subdola modestia tegens , non damnatione matris , non exitio fratrum rupta voce$$ About this time Caius Caesar ,  who became his grandfather's companion on his retirement to Capreae ,  married Claudia ,  daughter of Marcus Silanus He was a man who masked a savage temper under an artful guise of self-restraint ,  and neither his mother's doom nor the banishment of his brothers extorted from him a single utterance
 qualem diem Tiberius induisset , pari habitu , haud multum distantibus verbis$$ Whatever the humour of the day with Tiberius ,  he would assume the like ,  and his language differed as little
 unde mox scitum Passieni oratoris dictum percrebuit neque meliorem umquam servum neque deteriorem dominum fuisse$$ Hence the fame of a clever remark from the orator Passienus ,  that there never was a better slave or a worse master
 Non omiserim praesagium Tiberii de Servio Galba tum consule$$ I must not pass over a prognostication of Tiberius respecting Servius Galba ,  then consul
 quem accitum et diversis sermonibus pertemptatum postremo Graecis verbis in hanc sententiam adlocutus et tu , Galba , quandoque degustabis imperium , seram ac brevem potentiam significans , scientia Chaldaeorum artis , cuius apiscendae otium apud Rhodum , magistrum Thrasullum habuit , peritiam eius hoc modo expertus$$ Having sent for him and sounded him on various topics ,  he at last addressed him in Greek to this effect   You too ,  Galba ,  will some day have a taste of empire He thus hinted at a brief span of power late in life ,  on the strength of his acquaintance with the art of astrologers ,  leisure for acquiring which he had had at Rhodes ,  with Thrasyllus for instructor This man's skill he tested in the following manner
 Quotiens super tali negotio consultaret , edita domus parte ac liberti unius conscientia utebatur$$ Whenever he sought counsel on such matters ,  he would make use of the top of the house and of the confidence of one freedman ,  quite illiterate and of great physical strength
 is litterarum ignarus , corpore valido , per avia ac derupta (nam saxis domus imminet) praeibat eum cuius artem experiri Tiberius statuisset et regredientem , si vanitatis aut fraudum suspicio incesserat , in subiectum mare praecipitabat ne index arcani existeret$$ The man always walked in front of the person whose science Tiberius had determined to test ,  through an unfrequented and precipitous path (for the house stood on rocks) ,  and then ,  if any suspicion had arisen of imposture or of trickery ,  he hurled the astrologer ,  as he returned ,  into the sea beneath ,  that no one might live to betray the secret
 igitur Thrasullus isdem rupibus inductus postquam percontantem commoverat , imperium ipsi et futura sollerter patefaciens , interrogatur an suam quoque genitalem horam comperisset , quem tum annum , qualem diem haberet$$ Thrasyllus accordingly was led up the same cliffs ,  and when he had deeply impressed his questioner by cleverly revealing his imperial destiny and future career ,  he was asked whether he had also thoroughly ascertained his own horoscope ,  and the character of that particular year and day
 ille positus siderum ac spatia dimensus haerere primo , dein pavescere , et quantum introspiceret magis ac magis trepidus admirationis et metus , postremo exclamat ambiguum sibi ac prope ultimum discrimen instare$$ After surveying the positions and relative distances of the stars ,  he first paused ,  then trembled ,  and the longer he gazed ,  the more was he agitated by amazement and terror ,  till at last he exclaimed that a perilous and well-nigh fatal crisis impended over him
 tum complexus eum Tiberius praescium periculorum et incolumem fore gratatur , quaeque dixerat oracli vice accipiens inter intimos amicorum tenet$$ Tiberius then embraced him and congratulated him on foreseeing his dangers and on being quite safe Taking what he had said as an oracle ,  he retained him in the number of his intimate friends
 Isdem consulibus Asinii Galli mors vulgatur , quem egestate cibi peremptum haud dubium , sponte vel necessitate incertum habebatur$$ That same year the death of Asinius Gallus became known That he died of starvation ,  there was not a doubt whether of his own choice or by compulsion ,  was a question
 consultusque Caesar an sepeliri sineret , non erubuit permittere ultroque incusare casus qui reum abstulissent antequam coram convinceretur$$ The emperor was asked whether he would allow him to be buried ,  and he blushed not to grant the favour ,  and actually blamed the accident which had proved fatal to the accused before he could be convicted in his presence
 scilicet medio triennio defuerat tempus subeundi iudicium consulari seni , tot consularium parenti$$ Just as if in a three years' interval an opportunity was wanting for the trial of an old ex-consul and the father of a number of ex-consuls
 Drusus deinde extinguitur , cum se miserandis alimentis , mandendo e cubili tomento , nonum ad diem detinuisset$$ Next Drusus perished ,  after having prolonged life for eight days on the most wretched of food ,  even chewing the stuffing ,  his bed
 tradidere quidam praescriptum fuisse Macroni , si arma ab Seiano temptarentur , extractum custodiae iuvenem (nam in Palatio attinebatur) ducem populo imponere$$ According to some writers ,  Macro had been instructed that ,  in case of Sejanus attempting an armed revolt ,  he was to hurry the young prince out of the confinement in which he was detained in the Palace and put him at the head of the people
 mox , quia rumor incedebat fore ut nuru ac nepoti conciliaretur Caesar , saevitiam quam paenitentiam maluit$$ Subsequently the emperor ,  as a rumour was gaining ground that he was on the point of a reconciliation with his daughter-in-law and his grandson ,  chose to be merciless rather than to relent
 Quin et invectus in defunctum probra corporis , exitiabilem in suos , infensum rei publicae animum obiecit recitarique factorum dictorumque eius descripta per dies iussit , quo non aliud atrocius visum$$ He even bitterly reviled him after his death ,  taunting him with nameless abominations and with a spirit bent on his family's ruin and hostile to the State And ,  what seemed most horrible of all ,  he ordered a daily journal of all that he said and did to be read in public
 adstitisse tot per annos , qui vultum , gemitus , occultum etiam murmur exciperent , et potuisse avum audire , legeret , in publicum promere vix fides , nisi quod Attii centurionis et Didymi liberti epistulae servorum nomina praeferebant , ut quis egredientem cubiculo Drusum pulsaverat , exterruerat$$ That there had been spies by his side for so many years ,  to note his looks ,  his sighs ,  and even his whispered thoughts ,  and that his grandfather could have heard read ,  and published all ,  was scarce credible But letters of Attius ,  a centurion ,  and Didymus ,  a freedman ,  openly exhibited the names of slave after slave who had respectively struck or scared Drusus as he was quitting his chamber
 etiam sua verba centurio saevitiae plena , tamquam egregium , vocesque deficientis adiecerat , quis primo alienationem mentis simulans quasi per dementiam funesta Tiberio , mox , ubi exspes vitae fuit , meditatas compositasque diras imprecabatur , ut , quem ad modum nurum filiumque fratris et nepotes domumque omnem caedibus complevisset , ita poenas nomini generique maiorum et posteris exolveret$$ The centurion had actually added ,  as something highly meritorious ,  his own language in all its brutality ,  and some utterances of the dying man in which ,  at first feigning loss of reason ,  he imprecated in seeming madness fearful things on Tiberius ,  and then ,  when hope of life was gone ,  denounced him with a studied and elaborate curse As he had slain a daughter-in-law ,  a brother's son ,  and son's sons ,  and filled his whole house with bloodshed ,  so might he pay the full penalty due to the name and race of his ancestors as well as to future generations
 obturbabant quidem patres specie detestandi sed penetrabat pavor et admiratio , callidum olim et tegendis sceleribus obscurum huc confidentiae venisse ut tamquam dimotis parietibus ostenderet nepotem sub verbere centurionis , inter servorum ictus extrema vitae alimenta frustra orantem$$ The Senate clamorously interrupted ,  with an affectation of horror ,  but they were penetrated by alarm and amazement at seeing that a hitherto cunning prince ,  who had shrouded his wickedness in mystery ,  had waxed so bold as to remove ,  so to speak ,  the walls of his house and display his grandson under a centurion's lash ,  amid the buffetings of slaves ,  craving in vain the last sustenance of life
 Nondum is dolor exoleverat , cum de Agrippina auditum , quam interfecto Seiano spe sustentatam provixisse reor , et postquam nihil de saevitia remittebatur , voluntate extinctam , nisi si negatis alimentis adsimulatus est finis qui videretur sponte sumptus$$ Men's grief at all this had not died away when news was heard of Agrippina She had lived on ,  sustained by hope ,  I suppose ,  after the destruction of Sejanus ,  and ,  when she found no abatement of horrors ,  had voluntarily perished ,  though possibly nourishment was refused her and a fiction concocted of a death that might seem self-chosen
 enimvero Tiberius foedissimis criminationibus exarsit , impudicitiam arguens et Asinium Gallum adulterum , eiusque morte ad taedium vitae compulsam$$ Tiberius ,  it is certain ,  vented his wrath in the foulest charges He reproached her with unchastity ,  with having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence
 sed Agrippina aequi impatiens , dominandi avida , virilibus curis feminarum vitia exuerat$$ But Agrippina ,  who could not endure equality and loved to domineer ,  was with her masculine aspirations far removed from the frailties of women
 eodem die defunctam , quo biennio ante Seianus poenas luisset , memoriaeque id prodendum addidit Caesar iactavitque quod non laqueo strangulata neque in Gemonias proiecta foret$$ The emperor further observed that she died on the same day on which Sejanus had paid the penalty of his crime two years before ,  a fact ,  he said ,  to be recorded and he made it a boast that she had not been strangled by the halter and flung down the Gemonian steps
 actae ob id grates decretumque ut quintum decimum kal Novembris , utriusque necis die , per omnis annos donum Iovi sacraretur$$ He received a vote of thanks ,  and it was decreed that on the seventeenth of October ,  the day on which both perished ,  through all future years ,  an offering should be consecrated to Jupiter
 At Romae caede continua Pomponius Labeo , quem praefuisse Moesiae rettuli , per abruptas venas sanguinem effudit$$ Rome meanwhile being a scene of ceaseless bloodshed ,  Pomponius Labeo ,  who was ,  as I have related ,  governor of Moesia ,  severed his veins and let his life ebb from him
 aemulataque est coniunx Paxaea$$ His wife ,  Paxaea ,  emulated her husband
 nam promptas eius modi mortes metus carnificis faciebat , et quia damnati publicatis bonis sepultura prohibebantur , eorum qui de se statuebant humabantur corpora , manebant testamenta , pretium festinandi$$ What made such deaths eagerly sought was dread of the executioner ,  and the fact too that the condemned ,  besides forfeiture of their property ,  were deprived of burial ,  while those who decided their fate themselves ,  had their bodies interred ,  and their wills remained valid ,  a recompense this for their despatch
 sed Caesar missis ad senatum litteris disseruit morem fuisse maioribus , quoties dirimerent amicitias , interdicere domo eumque finem gratiae ponere$$ The emperor ,  however ,  argued in a letter to the Senate that it had been the practice of our ancestors ,  whenever they broke off an intimacy ,  to forbid the person their house ,  and so put an end to friendship
 id se repetivisse in Labeone , atque illum , quia male administratae provinciae aliorumque criminum urgebatur , culpam invidia velavisse , frustra conterrita uxore , quam etsi nocentem periculi tamen expertem fuisse$$ This usage he had himself revived in Labeo's case ,  but Labeo ,  being pressed by charges of maladministration in his province and other crimes ,  had screened his guilt by bringing odium on another ,  and had groundlessly alarmed his wife ,  who ,  though criminal ,  was still free from danger
 Mamercus dein Scaurus rursum postulatur , insignis nobilitate et orandis causis , vita probrosus$$ Mamercus Scaurus was then for the second time impeached ,  a man of distinguished rank and ability as an advocate ,  but of infamous life
 nihil hunc amicitia Seiani , sed labefecit haud minus validum ad exitia Macronis odium , qui easdem artes occultius exercebat detuleratque argumentum tragoediae a Scauro scriptae , additis versibus qui in Tiberium flecterentur$$ He fell ,  not through the friendship of Sejanus ,  but through what was no less powerful to destroy ,  the enmity of Macro ,  who practised the same arts more secretly Macro's information was grounded on the subject of a tragedy written by Scaurus ,  from which he cited some verses which might be twisted into allusions to Tiberius
 verum ab Servilio et Cornelio accusatoribus adulterium Liviae , magorum sacra obiectabantur$$ But Servilius and Cornelius ,  his accusers ,  alleged adultery with Livia and the practice of magical rites
 Scaurus , ut dignum veteribus Aemiliis , damnationem antiit , hortante Sextia uxore , quae incitamentum mortis et particeps fuit$$ Scaurus ,  as befitted the old house of the Aemilii ,  forestalled the fatal sentence at the persuasion of his wife Sextia ,  who urged him to die and shared his death
 Ac tamen accusatores , si facultas incideret , poenis adficiebantur , ut Servilius Corneliusque perdito Scauro famosi , quia pecuniam a Vario Ligure omittendae delationis ceperant , in insulas interdicto igni atque aqua demoti sunt$$ Still the informers were punished when ever an opportunity occurred Servilius and Cornelius ,  for example ,  whom the destruction of Scaurus had made notorious ,  were outlawed and transported to some islands for having taken money from Varius Ligur for dropping a prosecution
 et Abudius Ruso functus aedilitate , dum Lentulo Gaetulico , sub quo legioni praefuerat , periculum facessit quod is Seiani filium generum destinasset , ultro damnatur atque urbe exigitur$$ Abudius Ruso too ,  who had been an aedile ,  in seeking to imperil Lentulus Gaetulicus ,  under whom he had commanded a legion ,  by alleging that he had fixed on a son of Sejanus for his son-in-law ,  was himself actually condemned and banished from Rome
 Gaetulicus ea tempestate superioris Germaniae legiones curabat mirumque amorem adsecutus erat , effusae clementiae , modicus severitate et proximo quoque exercitui per Lucius Apronium socerum non ingratus$$ Gaetulicus at this time was in charge of the legions of Upper Germany ,  and had won from them singular affection ,  as a man of unbounded kindliness ,  moderate in his strictness ,  and popular even with the neighbouring army through his father-in-law ,  Lucius Apronius
 unde fama constans ausum mittere ad Caesarem litteras , adfinitatem sibi cum Seiano haud sponte sed consilio Tiberii coeptam$$ Hence rumour persistently affirmed that he had ventured to send the emperor a letter ,  reminding him that his alliance with Sejanus had not originated in his own choice ,  but in the advice of Tiberius
 perinde se quam Tiberium falli potuisse , neque errorem eundem illi sine fraude , aliis exitio habendum$$ that he was himself as liable to be deceived as Tiberius ,  and that the same mistake ought not to be held innocent in the prince and be a source of ruin to others
 sibi fidem integram et , si nullis insidiis peteretur , mansuram$$ His loyalty was still untainted and would so remain ,  if he was not assaIled by any plot
 successorem non aliter quam indicium mortis accepturum$$ A successor he should accept as an announcement of his doom
 firmarent velut foedus , quo princeps ceterarum rerum poteretur , ipse provinciam retineret$$ A compact ,  so to say ,  ought to be sealed between them ,  by which he should retain his province ,  and the emperor be master of all else
 haec , mira quamquam , fidem ex eo trahebant quod unus omnium Seiani adfinium incolumis multaque gratia mansit , reputante Tiberio publicum sibi odium , extremam aetatem magisque fama quam vi stare res suas$$ Strange as this story was ,  it derived credibility from the fact that Gaetulicus alone of all connected with Sejanus lived in safety and in high favour ,  Tiberius bearing in mind the people's hatred ,  his own extreme age how his government rested more on prestige than on power
 Gaius Cestio Marcus Servilio consulibus nobiles Parthi in urbem venere , ignaro rege Artabano$$ In the consulship of Caius Cestius and Marcus Servilius ,  some Parthian nobles came to Rome without the knowledge of their king Artabanus
 is metu Germanici fidus Romanis , aequabilis in suos , mox superbiam in nos , saevitiam in popularis sumpsit , fretus bellis quae secunda adversum circumiectas nationes exercuerat , et senectutem Tiberii ut inermem despiciens avidusque Armeniae , cui defuncto rege Artaxia Arsacen liberorum suorum veterrimum imposuit , addita contumelia et missis qui gazam a Vonone relictam in Syria Ciliciaque reposcerent$$ Dread of Germanicus had made that prince faithful to the Romans and just to his people ,  but he subsequently changed this behaviour for insolence towards us and tyranny to his subjects He was elated by the wars which he had successfully waged against the surrounding nations ,  while he disdained the aged and ,  as he thought ,  unwarlike Tiberius ,  eagerly coveting Armenia ,  over which ,  on the death of Artaxias ,  he placed Arsaces ,  his eldest son He further added insult ,  and sent envoys to reclaim the treasures left by Vonones in Syria and Cilicia
 simul veteres Persarum ac Macedonum terminos seque invasurum possessa Cyro et post Alexandro per vaniloquentiam ac minas iaciebat$$ Then too he insisted on the ancient boundaries of Persia and Macedonia ,  and intimated ,  with a vainglorious threat ,  that he meant to seize on the country possessed by Cyrus and afterwards by Alexander
 sed Parthis mittendi secretos nuntios validissimus auctor fuit Sinnaces , insigni familia ac perinde opibus , et proximus huic Abdus ademptae virilitatis$$ The chief adviser of the Parthians in sending the secret embassy was Sinnaces ,  a man of distinguished family and corresponding wealth Next in influence was Abdus ,  an eunuch ,  a class which ,  far from being despised among barbarians ,  actually possesses power
 non despectum id apud barbaros ultroque potentiam habet ii adscitis et aliis primoribus , quia neminem gentis Arsacidarum summae rei imponere poterant , interfectis ab Artabano plerisque aut nondum adultis , Phraaten regis Phraatis filium Roma poscebant$$ These ,  with some other nobles whom they admitted to their counsels ,  as there was not a single Arsacid whom they could put on the throne ,  most of the family having been murdered by Artabanus or being under age ,  demanded that Phraates ,  son of king Phraates ,  should be sent from Rome
 nomine tantum et auctore opus ut sponte Caesaris ut genus Arsacis ripam apud Euphratis cerneretur$$ Only a name ,  they said ,  and an authority were wanted only ,  in fact ,  that ,  with Caesar's consent ,  a scion of the house of Arsaces should show himself on the banks of the Euphrates
 Cupitum id Tiberio$$ This suited the wishes of Tiberius
 ornat Phraaten accingitque paternum ad fastigium , destinata retinens , consiliis et astu res externas moliri , arma procul habere$$ He provided Phraates with what he needed for assuming his father's sovereignty ,  while he clung to his purpose of regulating foreign affairs by a crafty policy and keeping war at a distance
 interea cognitis insidiis Artabanus tardari metu , modo cupidine vindictae inardescere$$ Artabanus meanwhile ,  hearing of the treacherous arrangement ,  was one moment perplexed by apprehension ,  the next fired with a longing for revenge
 et barbaris cunctatio servilis , statim exequi regium videtur$$ With barbarians ,  indecision is a slave's weakness
 valuit tamen utilitas , ut Abdum specie amicitiae vocatum ad epulas lento veneno inligaret , Sinnacen dissimulatione ac donis , simul per negotia moraretur$$ prompt action king-like But now expediency prevailed ,  and he invited Abdus ,  under the guise of friendship ,  to a banquet ,  and disabled him by a lingering poison
 et Phraates apud Syriam dum omisso cultu Romano , cui per tot annos insueverat , instituta Parthorum sumit , patriis moribus impar morbo absumptus est sed non Tiberius omisit incepta$$ Sinnaces he put off by pretexts and presents ,  and also by various employments Phraates meanwhile ,  on arriving in Syria ,  where he threw off the Roman fashions to which for so many years he had been accustomed ,  and adapted himself to Parthian habits ,  unable to endure the customs of his country ,  was carried off by an illness
 Tiridaten sanguinis eiusdem aemulum Artabano reciperandaeque Armeniae Hiberum Mithridaten deligit conciliatque fratri Pharasmani , qui gentile imperium obtinebat$$ Still ,  Tiberius did not relinquish his purpose He chose Tiridates ,  of the same stock as Artabanus ,  to be his rival ,  and the Iberian Mithridates to be the instrument of recovering Armenia ,  having reconciled him to his brother Pharasmanes ,  who held the throne of that country
 et cunctis quae apud Orientem parabantur Lucius Vitellium praefecit$$ He then intrusted the whole of his eastern policy to Lucius Vitellius
 eo de homine haud sum ignarus sinistram in urbe famam , pleraque foeda memorari$$ The man ,  I am aware ,  had a bad name at Rome ,  and many a foul story was told of him
 ceterum regendis provinciis prisca virtute egit$$ But in the government of provinces he acted with the virtue of ancient times
 unde regressus et formidine G Caesaris , familiaritate Claudii turpe in servitium mutatus exemplar apud posteros adulatorii dedecoris habetur , cesseruntque prima postremis , et bona iuventae senectus flagitiosa oblitteravit$$ He returned ,  and then ,  through fear of Caius Caesar and intimacy with Claudius ,  he degenerated into a servility so base that he is regarded by an after-generation as the type of the most degrading adulation The beginning of his career was forgotten in its end ,  and an old age of infamy effaced the virtues of youth
 Enimvero apud Sarmatas non una vox ducis$$ Among the Sarmatae the general's voice was not alone to be heard
 se quisque stimulant ne pugnam per sagittas sinerent$$ They encouraged one another not to begin the battle with volleys of arrows
 impetu et comminus praeveniendum$$ they must ,  they said ,  anticipate attack by a hand to hand charge
 variae hinc bellantium species , cum Parthus sequi vel fugere pari arte suetus distraheret turmas , spatium ictibus quaereret , Sarmatae omisso arcu , quo brevius valent , contis gladiisque ruerent$$ Then followed every variety of conflict The Parthians ,  accustomed to pursue or fly with equal science ,  deployed their squadrons ,  and sought scope for their missiles The Sarmatae ,  throwing aside their bows ,  which at a shorter range are effective ,  rushed on with pikes and swords
 modo equestris proelii more frontis et tergi vices , aliquando ut conserta acies corporibus et pulsu armorum pellerent pellerentur$$ Sometimes ,  as in a cavalry-action ,  there would be alternate advances and retreats ,  then ,  again ,  close fighting ,  in which ,  breast to breast ,  with the clash of arms ,  they repulsed the foe or were themselves repulsed
 iamque et Albani Hiberique prensare , detrudere , ancipitem pugnam hostibus facere , quos super eques et propioribus vulneribus pedites adflictabant$$ And now the Albanians and Iberians seized ,  and hurled the Parthians from their steeds ,  and embarrassed their enemy with a double attack ,  pressed as they were by the cavalry on the heights and by the nearer blows of the infantry
 inter quae Pharasmanes Orodesque , dum strenuis adsunt aut dubitantibus subveniunt , conspicui eoque gnari , clamore telis equis concurrunt , instantius Pharasmanes$$ Meanwhile Pharasmanes and Orodes ,  who ,  as they cheered on the brave and supported the wavering ,  were conspicuous to all ,  and so recognised each other ,  rushed to the combat with a shout ,  with javelins ,  and galloping chargers ,  Pharasmanes with the greater impetuosity ,  for he pierced his enemy's helmet at a stroke
 nam vulnus per galeam adegit nec iterare valuit , praelatus equo et fortissimis satellitum protegentibus saucium$$ But he could not repeat the blow ,  as he was hurried onwards by his horse ,  and the wounded man was protected by the bravest of his guards
 fama tamen occisi falso credita exterruit Parthos victoriamque concessere$$ A rumour that he was slain ,  which was believed by mistake ,  struck panic into the Parthians ,  and they yielded the victory
 Mox Artabanus tota mole regni ultum iit$$ Artabanus very soon marched with the whole strength of his kingdom ,  intent on vengeance
 peritia locorum ab Hiberis melius pugnatum$$ The Iberians from their knowledge of the country fought at an advantage
 nec ideo abscedebat , ni contractis legionibus Vitellius et subdito rumore tamquam Mesopotamiam invasurus metum Romani belli fecisset$$ Still Artabanus did not retreat till Vitellius had assembled his legions and ,  by starting a report that he meant to invade Mesopotamia ,  raised an alarm of war with Rome
 tum omissa Armenia versaeque Artabani res , inliciente Vitellio desererent regem saevum in pace et adversis proeliorum exitiosum$$ Armenia was then abandoned ,  and the fortunes of Artabanus were overthrown ,  Vitellius persuading his subjects to forsake a king who was a tyrant in peace ,  and ruinously unsuccessful in war
 igitur Sinnaces , quem antea infensum memoravi , patrem Abdagaesen aliosque occultos consilii et tunc continuis cladibus promptiores ad defectionem trahit , adfluentibus paulatim qui metu magis quam benevolentia subiecti repertis auctoribus sustulerant animum$$ And so Sinnaces ,  whose enmity to the prince I have already mentioned ,  drew into actual revolt his father Abdageses and others ,  who had been secretly in his counsel ,  and were now after their continued disasters more eager to fight By degrees ,  many flocked to him who ,  having been kept in subjection by fear rather than by goodwill ,  took courage as soon as they found leaders
 nec iam aliud Artabano reliquum quam si qui externorum corpori custodes aderant , suis quisque sedibus extorres , quis neque boni intellectus neque mali cura sed mercede aluntur ministri sceleribus$$ Artabanus had now no resources but in some foreigners who guarded his person ,  men exiled from their own homes ,  who had no perception of honour ,  or any scruple about a base act ,  mere hireling instruments of crime
 his adsumptis in longinqua et contermina Scythiae fugam maturavit , spe auxilii , quia Hyrcanis Carmaniisque per adfinitatem innexus erat$$ With these attendants he hastened his flight into the remote country on the borders of Scythia ,  in the hope of aid ,  as he was connected by marriage alliances with the Hyrcanians and Carmanians
 atque interim posse Parthos absentium aequos , praesentibus mobilis , ad paenitentiam mutari$$ Meantime the Parthians ,  he thought ,  indulgent as they are to an absent prince ,  though restless under his presence ,  might turn to a better mind
 At Vitellius profugo Artabano et flexis ad novum regem popularium animis , hortatus Tiridaten parata capessere , robur legionum sociorumque ripam ad Euphratis ducit$$ Vitellius ,  as soon as Artabanus had fled and his people were inclined to have a new king ,  urged Tiridates to seize the advantage thus offered ,  and then led the main strength of the legions and the allies to the banks of the Euphrates
 sacrificantibus , cum hic more Romano suovetaurilia daret , ille equum placando amni adornasset , nuntiavere accolae Euphraten nulla imbrium vi sponte et immensum attolli , simul albentibus spumis in modum diadematis sinuare orbis , auspicium prosperi transgressus$$ While they were sacrificing ,  the one ,  after Roman custom ,  offering a swine ,  a ram and a bull the other ,  a horse which he had duly prepared as a propitiation to the river-god ,  they were informed by the neighbouring inhabitants that the Euphrates ,  without any violent rains ,  was of itself rising to an immense height ,  and that the white foam was curling into circles like a diadem ,  an omen of a prosperous passage
 quidam callidius interpretabantur initia conatus secunda neque diuturna , quia eorum quae terra caelove portenderentur certior fides , fluminum instabilis natura simul ostenderet omina raperetque$$ Some explained it with more subtlety ,  of a successful commencement to the enterprise ,  which ,  however ,  would not be lasting ,  on the ground ,  that though a confident trust might be placed in prognostics given in the earth or in the heavens ,  the fluctuating character of rivers exhibited omens which vanished the same moment
 sed ponte navibus effecto tramissoque exercitu primus Ornospades multis equitum milibus in castra venit , exul quondam et Tiberio , cum Delmaticum bellum conficeret , haud inglorius auxiliator eoque civitate Romana donatus , mox repetita amicitia regis multo apud eum honore , praefectus campis qui Euphrate et Tigre inclutis amnibus circumflui Mesopotamiae nomen acceperunt$$ A bridge of boats having been constructed and the army having crossed ,  the first to enter the camp was Ornospades ,  with several thousand cavalry Formerly an exile ,  he had rendered conspicuous aid to Tiberius in the completion of the Dalmatic war ,  and had for this been rewarded with Roman citizenship Subsequently ,  he had again sought the friendship of his king ,  by whom he had been raised to high honour ,  and appointed governor of the plains ,  which ,  being surrounded by the waters of those famous rivers ,  the Euphrates and Tigris ,  have received the name of Mesopotamia
 neque multo post Sinnaces auget copias , et columen partium Abdagaeses gazam et paratus regios adicit$$ Soon afterwards ,  Sinnaces reinforced the army ,  and Abdageses ,  the mainstay of the party ,  came with the royal treasure and what belonged to the crown
 Vitellius ostentasse Romana arma satis ratus monet Tiridaten primoresque , hunc , Phraatis avi et altoris Caesaris quaeque utrubique pulchra meminerit , illos , obsequium in regem , reverentiam in nos , decus quisque suum et fidem retinerent$$ Vitellius thought it enough to have displayed the arms of Rome ,  and he then bade Tiridates remember his grandfather Phraates ,  and his foster-father Caesar ,  and all that was glorious in both of them ,  while the nobles were to show obedience to their king ,  and respect for us ,  each maintaining his honour and his loyalty
 exim cum legionibus in Syriam remeavit$$ This done ,  he returned with the legions to Syria
 Quae duabus aestatibus gesta coniunxi quo requie scerete animus a domesticis malis$$ I have related in sequence the events of two summer-campaigns ,  as a relief to the reader's mind from our miseries at home
 non enim Tiberium , quamquam triennio post caedem Seiani , quae ceteros mollire solent , tempus preces satias mitigabant , quin incerta vel abolita pro gravissimis et recentibus puniret$$ Though three years had elapsed since the destruction of Sejanus ,  neither time ,  intreaties ,  nor sated gratification ,  all which have a soothing effect on others ,  softened Tiberius ,  or kept him from punishing doubtful or forgotten offenses as most flagrant and recent crimes
 eo metu Fulcinius Trio ingruentis accusatores haud perpessus supremis tabulis multa et atrocia in Macronem ac praecipuos libertorum Caesaris composuit , ipsi fluxam senio mentem et continuo abscessu velut exilium obiectando$$ Under this dread ,  Fulcinius Trio ,  unwilling to face an onslaught of accusers ,  inserted in his will several terrible imputations on Macro and on the emperor's principal freedmen ,  while he taunted the emperor himself with the mental decay of old age ,  and the virtual exile of continuous retirement
 quae ab heredibus occultata recitari Tiberius iussit , patientiam libertatis alienae ostentans et contemptor suae infamiae , an scelerum Seiani diu nescius mox quoquo modo dicta vulgari malebat veritatisque , cui adulatio officit , per probra saltem gnarus fieri$$ Tiberius ordered these insults ,  which Trio's heirs had suppressed ,  to be publicly read ,  thus showing his tolerance of free speech in others and despising his own shame ,  or ,  possibly ,  because he had long been ignorant of the villanies of Sejanus ,  and now wished any remarks ,  however reckless ,  to published ,  and so to ascertain ,  through invective ,  if it must be so ,  the truth ,  which flattery obscures
 isdem diebus Granius Marcianus senator , a Gaius Graccho maiestatis postulatus , vim vitae suae attulit , Tariusque Gratianus praetura functus lege eadem extremum ad supplicium damnatus$$ About the same time Granius Marcianus ,  a senator ,  who was accused of treason by Caius Gracchus ,  laid hands on himself Tarius Gratianus too ,  an ex-praetor ,  was condemned under the same law to capital punishment
 Nec dispares Trebelleni Rufi et Sextii Paconiani exitus$$ A similar fate befell Trebellienus Rufus and Sextius Paconianus

 Crebra post haec fama fuit , inter diversas principis voces , cum modo incusaret flagitia uxoris , aliquando ad memoriam coniugii et infantiam liberorum revolveretur , non aliud prolocutum Vitellium quam ïo facinus! o scelus! instabat quidem Narcissus aperire ambages et veri copiam facere sed non ideo pervicit quin suspensa et quo ducerentur inclinatura responderet exemploque eius Largus Caecina uteretur$$ It was currently reported in after times that while the emperor broke into contradictory exclamations ,  now inveighing against the infamies of his wife ,  and now ,  returning in thought to the remembrance of his love and of his infant children ,  Vitellius said nothing but ,  What audacity! what wickedness! Narcissus indeed kept pressing him to clear up his ambiguities and let the truth be known ,  but still he could not prevail upon him to utter anything that was not vague and susceptible of any meaning which might be put on it ,  or upon Largus Caecina ,  to do anything but follow his example

 at Silanus insidiarum nescius ac forte eo anno praetor , repente per edictum Vitellii ordine senatorio movetur , quamquam lecto pridem senatu lustroque condito$$ Silanus meanwhile ,  who knew nothing of the plot ,  and happened that year to be praetor ,  was suddenly expelled from the Senate by an edict of Vitellius ,  though the roll of Senators had been recently reviewed and the lustrum closed
 simul adfinitatem Claudius diremit , adactusque Silanus eiurare magistratum , et reliquus praeturae dies in Eprium Marcellum conlatus est$$ Claudius at the same time broke off the connection Silanus was forced to resign his office ,  and the one remaining day of his praetorship was conferred on Eprius Marcellus

 nec diu anquirendum quin Agrippina claritudine generis anteiret$$ It cannot ,  he said ,  be long a question that Agrippina stands first in nobility of birth
 datum ab ea fecunditatis experimentum et congruere artes honestas$$ She has given proof too that she is not barren ,  and she has suitable moral qualities
 id vero egregium , quod provisu deum vidua iungeretur principi sua tantum matrimonia experto$$ It is ,  again ,  a singular advantage to us ,  due to divine providence ,  for a widow to be united to an emperor who has limited himself to his own lawful wives
 audivisse a parentibus , vidisse ipsos abripi coniuges ad libita Caesarum$$ We have heard from our fathers ,  we have ourselves seen that married women were seized at the caprice of the Caesars

 at Agrippina ne malis tantum facinoribus notesceret veniam exilii pro Annaeo Seneca , simul praeturam impetrat , laetum in publicum rata ob claritudinem studiorum eius , utque Domitii pueritia tali magistro adolesceret et consiliis eiusdem ad spem dominationis uterentur , quia Seneca fidus in Agrippinam memoria beneficii et infensus Claudio dolore iniuriae credebatur$$ Agrippina ,  that she might not be conspicuous only by her evil deeds ,  procured for Annaeus Seneca a remission of his exile ,  and with it the praetorship She thought this would be universally welcome ,  from the celebrity of his attainments ,  and it was her wish too for the boyhood of Domitius to be trained under so excellent an instructor ,  and for them to have the benefit of his counsels in their designs on the throne For Seneca ,  it was believed ,  was devoted to Agrippina from a remembrance of her kindness ,  and an enemy to Claudius from a bitter sense of wrong
 Placitum dehinc non ultra cunctari , sed designatum consulem Mammium Pollionem ingentibus promissis inducunt sententiam expromere , qua oraretur Claudius despondere Octaviam Domitio , quod aetati utriusque non absurdum et maiora patefacturum erat$$ It was then resolved to delay no longer Memmius Pollio ,  the consul-elect ,  was induced by great promises to deliver a speech ,  praying Claudius to betroth Octavia to Domitius The match was not unsuitable to the age of either ,  and was likely to develop still more important results Pollio introduced the motion in much the same language as Vitellius had lately used
 Pollio haud disparibus verbis ac nuper Vitellius censet despondeturque Octavia , ac super priorem necessitudinem sponsus iam et gener Domitius aequari Britannico studiis matris , arte eorum quis ob accusatam Messalinam ultio ex filio timebatur$$ So Octavia was betrothed ,  and Domitius ,  besides his previous relationship ,  became now the emperor's affianced son-in-law ,  and an equal of Britannicus ,  through the exertions of his mother and the cunning of those who had been the accusers of Messalina ,  and feared the vengeance of her son
 Per idem tempus legati Parthorum ad expetendum , ut rettuli , Meherdaten missi senatum ingrediuntur mandataque in hunc modum incipiunt$$ About the same time an embassy from the Parthians ,  which had been sent ,  as I have stated ,  to solicit the return of Meherdates ,  was introduced into the Senate ,  and delivered a message to the following effect 
 non se foederis ignaros nec defectione a familia Arsacidarum venire , set filium Vononis , nepotem Pharaatis accersere adversus dominationem Gotarzis nobilitati plebique iuxta intolerandam$$ They were not ,  they said ,  unaware of the treaty of alliance ,  nor did their coming imply any revolt from the family of the Arsacids indeed ,  even the son of Vonones ,  Phraates's grandson ,  was with them in their resistance to the despotism of Gotarzes ,  which was alike intolerable to the nobility and to the people
 iam fratres , iam propinquos , iam longius sitos caedibus exhaustos$$ Already brothers ,  relatives ,  and distant kin had been swept off by murder after murder
 adici coniuges gravidas , liberos parvos , dum socors domi , bellis infaustus ignaviam saevitia tegat$$ wives actually pregnant ,  and tender children were added to Gotarzes' victims ,  while ,  slothful at home and unsuccessful in war ,  he made cruelty a screen for his feebleness
 veterem sibi ac publice coeptam nobiscum amicitiam , et subveniendum sociis virium aemulis cedentibusque per reverentiam$$ Between the Parthians and ourselves there was an ancient friendship ,  founded on a state alliance ,  and we ought to support allies who were our rivals in strength ,  and yet yielded to us out of respect
 ideo regum obsides liberos dari ut , si domestici imperii taedeat , sit regressus ad principem patresque , quorum moribus adsuefactus rex melior adscisceretur$$ Kings' sons were given as hostages ,  in order that when Parthia was tired of home rule ,  it might fall back on the emperor and the Senate ,  and receive from them a better sovereign ,  familiar with Roman habits
 Vbi haec atque talia dissertavere , incipit orationem Caesar de fastigio Romano Parthorumque obsequiis , seque divo Augusto adaequabat , petitum ab eo regem referens omissa Tiberii memoria , quamquam is quoque miserat$$ In answer to these and like arguments Claudius began to speak of the grandeur of Rome and the submissive attitude of the Parthians He compared himself to the Divine Augustus ,  from whom ,  he reminded them ,  they had sought a king ,  but omitted to mention Tiberius ,  though he too had sent them sovereigns
 addidit praecepta (etenim aderat Meherdates) , ut non dominationem et servos , sed rectorem et civis cogitaret , clementiamque ac iustitiam , quanto ignota barbaris , tanto laetiora capesseret$$ He added some advice for Meherdates ,  who was present ,  and told him not to be thinking of a despot and his slaves ,  but rather of a ruler among fellow citizens ,  and to practise clemency and justice which barbarians would like the more for being unused to them
 hinc versus ad legatos extollit laudibus alumnum urbis , spectatae ad id modestiae$$ Then he turned to the envoys and bestowed high praise on the young foster-son of Rome ,  as one whose self-control had hitherto been exemplary
 ac tamen ferenda regum ingenia neque usui crebras mutationes$$ Still ,  he said ,  they must bear with the caprices of kings ,  and frequent revolutions were bad
 rem Romanam huc satietate gloriae provectam ut externis quoque gentibus quietem velit$$ Rome ,  sated with her glory ,  had reached such a height that ,  she wished even foreign nations to enjoy repose
 datum posthac Gaius Cassio , qui Syriae praeerat , deducere iuvenem ripam ad Euphratis$$ Upon this Caius Cassius ,  governor of Syria ,  was commissioned to escort the young prince to the bank of the Euphrates
 Ea tempestate Cassius ceteros praeminebat peritia legum$$ Cassius was at that time pre-eminent for legal learning
 nam militares artes per otium ignotae , industriosque aut ignavos pax in aequo tenet$$ The profession of the soldier is forgotten in a quiet period ,  and peace reduces the enterprising and indolent to an equality
 ac tamen quantum sine bello dabatur , revocare priscum morem , exercitare legiones , cura provisu perinde agere ac si hostis ingrueret$$ But Cassius ,  as far as it was possible without war ,  revived ancient discipline ,  kept exercising the legions ,  in short ,  used as much diligence and precaution as if an enemy were threatening him
 ita dignum maioribus suis et familia Cassia per illas quoque gentis celebrata$$ This conduct he counted worthy of his ancestors and of the Cassian family which had won renown even in those countries
 igitur excitis quorum de sententia petitus rex , positisque castris apud Zeugma , unde maxime pervius amnis , postquam inlustres Parthi rexque Arabum Acbarus advenerat , monet Meherdaten barbarorum impetus acris cunctatione languescere aut in perfidiam mutari$$ He then summoned those at whose suggestion a king had been sought from Rome ,  and having encamped at Zeugma where the river was most easily fordable and awaited the arrival of the chief men of Parthia and of Acbarus ,  king of the Arabs ,  he reminded Meherdates that the impulsive enthusiasm of barbarians soon flags from delay or even changes into treachery ,  and that therefore he should urge on his enterprise
 ita urgeret coepta quod spretum fraude Acbari , qui iuvenem ignarum et summam fortunam in luxu ratum multos per dies attinuit apud oppidum Edessam$$ The advice was disregarded through the perfidy Acbarus ,  by whom the foolish young prince ,  who thought that the highest position merely meant self-indulgence ,  was detained for several days in the town of Edessa
 et vocante Carene promptasque res ostentante , si citi advenissent , non comminus Mesopotamiam , sed flexu Armeniam petivit , id temporis importunam , quia hiems occipiebat$$ Although a certain Carenes pressed them to come and promised easy success if they hastened their arrival ,  they did not make for Mesopotamia ,  which was close to them ,  but ,  by a long detour ,  for Armenia ,  then ill-suited to their movements ,  as winter was beginning
 Tunc composito agmine incedunt , cuius frontem et terga Aorsi , media cohortes et Bosporani tutabantur nostris in armis$$ Then the army advanced in regular formation ,  the Adorsi in the van and the rear ,  while the centre was strengthened by the cohorts ,  and native troops of Bosporus with Roman arms
 sic pulsus hostis , ventumque Sozam , oppidum Dandaricae , quod desertum a Mithridate ob ambiguos popularium animos obtineri relicto ibi praesidio visum$$ Thus the enemy was defeated ,  and they reached Soza ,  a town in Dandarica ,  which Mithridates had abandoned ,  where it was thought expedient to leave a garrison ,  as the temper of the people was uncertain
 exim in Siracos pergunt , et transgressi amnem Pandam circumveniunt urbem Vspen , editam loco et moenibus ac fossis munitam , nisi quod moenia non saxo sed cratibus et vimentis ac media humo adversum inrumpentis invalida erant$$ Next they marched on the Siraci ,  and after crossing the river Panda besieged the city of Uspe ,  which stood on high ground ,  and had the defence of wall and fosses only the walls ,  not being of stone ,  but of hurdles and wicker-work with earth between ,  were too weak to resist an assault

 censentur Ostorio triumphi insignia , prosperis ad id rebus eius , mox ambiguis , sive amoto Carataco , quasi debellatum foret , minus intenta apud nos militia fuit , sive hostes miseratione tanti regis acrius ad ultionem exarsere$$ Triumphal distinctions were voted to Ostorius ,  who thus far had been successful ,  but soon afterwards met with reverses either because ,  when Caractacus was out of the way ,  our discipline was relaxed under an impression that the war was ended ,  or because the enemy ,  out of compassion for so great a king ,  was more ardent in his thirst for vengeance
 praefectum castrorum et legionarias cohortis extruendis apud Siluras praesidiis relictas circumfundunt ac ni cito nuntiis ex castellis proxi mis subventum foret copiarum obsidio occidione obcubuissent$$ Instantly they rushed from all parts on the camp-prefect ,  and legionary cohorts left to establish fortified positions among the Silures ,  and had not speedy succour arrived from towns and fortresses in the neighbourhood ,  our forces would then have been totally destroyed

 ac praecipua Silurum pervicacia , quos accendebat vulgata imperatoris Romani vox , ut quondam Sugambri excisi aut in Gallias traiecti forent , ita Silurum nomen penitus extinguendum$$ Conspicuous above all in stubborn resistance were the Silures ,  whose rage was fired by words rumoured to have been spoken by the Roman general ,  to the effect ,  that as the Sugambri had been formerly destroyed or transplanted into Gaul ,  so the name of the Silures ought to be blotted out
 igitur duas auxiliaris cohortis avaritia praefectorum incautius populantis intercepere$$ Accordingly they cut off two of our auxiliary cohorts ,  the rapacity of whose officers let them make incautious forays
 spoliaque et captivos largiendo ceteras quoque nationes ad defectionem trahebant , cum taedio curarum fessus Ostorius concessit vita , laetis hostibus , tamquam ducem haud spernendum etsi non proelium , at certe bellum absumpsisset$$ and by liberal gifts of spoil and prisoners to the other tribes ,  they were luring them too into revolt ,  when Ostorius ,  worn out by the burden of his anxieties ,  died ,  to the joy of the enemy ,  who thought that a campaign at least ,  though not a single battle ,  had proved fatal to general whom none could despise

 Silures id quoque damnum intulerant lateque persultabant , donec adcursu Didii pellerentur$$ This loss too had been inflicted on us by the Silures ,  and they were scouring the country far and wide ,  till Didius hurried up and dispersed them

 inde accensi hostes , stimulante ignominia , ne feminae imperio subderentur , valida et lecta armis iuventus regnum eius invadunt$$ This enraged the enemy ,  who were stung with shame at the prospect of falling under the dominion of a woman
 quod nobis praevisum , et missae auxilio cohortes acre proelium fecere , cuius initio ambiguo finis laetior fuit$$ The flower of their youth ,  picked out for war ,  invaded her kingdom

 verum Agrippina fratri eius Lucius Silano necem molita ultorem metuebat , crebra vulgi fama anteponendum esse vixdum pueritiam egresso Neroni et imperium per scelus adepto virum aetate composita insontem , nobilem et , quod tunc spectaretur , e Caesarum posteris$$ The truth was that Agrippina ,  having contrived the murder of his brother Lucius Silanus ,  dreaded his vengeance for it was the incessant popular talk that preference ought to be given over Nero ,  who was scarcely out of his boyhood and had gained the empire by crime ,  to a man of mature age ,  of blameless life ,  of noble birth ,  and ,  as a point then much regarded ,  of the line of the Caesars

 Ibaturque in caedes , nisi Afranius Burrus et Annaeus Seneca obviam issent$$ And now they had proceeded to further murders but for the opposition of Afranius Burrus and Annaeus Seneca
 hi rectores imperatoriae iuventae et , rarum in societate potentiae , concordes , diversa arte ex aequo pollebant , Burrus militaribus curis et severitate morum , Seneca praeceptis eloquentiae et comitate honesta , iuvantes in vicem , quo facilius lubricam principis aetatem , si virtutem aspernaretur , voluptatibus concessis retinerent$$ These two men guided the emperor's youth with an unity of purpose seldom found where authority is shared ,  and though their accomplishments were wholly different ,  they had equal influence Burrus ,  with his soldier's discipline and severe manners ,  Seneca ,  with lessons of eloquence and a dignified courtesy ,  strove alike to confine the frailty of the prince's youth ,  should he loathe virtue ,  within allowable indulgences

 sed neque Neroni infra servos ingenium , et Pallas tristi adrogantia modum liberti egressus taedium sui moverat$$ Nero's temper however was not one to submit to slaves ,  and Pallas ,  by a surly arrogance quite beyond a freedman ,  had provoked disgust

 decreti et a senatu duo lictores , flamonium Claudiale , simul Claudio censorium funus et mox consecratio$$ The Senate also decreed her two lictors ,  with the office of priestess to Claudius ,  and voted to the late emperor a censor's funeral ,  which was soon followed by deification

 tum formam futuri principis praescripsit , ea maxime declinans , quorum recens flagrabat invidia$$ He then sketched the plan of his future government ,  carefully avoiding anything which had kindled recent odium
 non enim se negotiorum omnium iudicem fore , ut clausis unam intra domum accusatoribus et reis paucorum potentia grassaretur$$ He would not ,  he said ,  be judge in all cases ,  or ,  by confining the accuser and the accused within the same walls ,  let the power of a few favourites grow dangerously formidable

 quod quidem adversante Agrippina , tamquam acta Claudii subverterentur , obtinuere patres , qui in Palatium ob id vocabantur , ut adstaret additis a tergo foribus velo discreta , quod visum arceret , auditus non adimeret$$ This was opposed by Agrippina ,  as a reversal of the legislation of Claudius ,  but it was carried by the senators who used to be summoned to the palace ,  in order that she might stand close to a hidden door behind them ,  screened by a curtain which was enough to shut her out of sight ,  but not out of hearing
 quin et legatis Armeniorum causam gentis apud Neronem orantibus escendere suggestum imperatoris et praesidere simul parabat , nisi ceteris pavore defixis Seneca admonuisset , venienti matri occurrere$$ When envoys from Armenia were pleading their nation's cause before Nero ,  she actually was on the point of mounting the emperor's tribunal and of presiding with him but Seneca ,  when every one else was paralysed with alarm ,  motioned to the prince to go and meet his mother
 ita specie pietatis obviam itum dedecori$$ Thus ,  by an apparently dutiful act ,  a scandalous scene was prevented
 Sed apud senatum omnia in maius celebrata sunt sententiis eorum , qui supplicationes et diebus supplicationum vestem principi triumphalem , utque ovans urbem iniret , effigiemque eius pari magnitudine ac Martis Ultoris eodem in templo censuere , praeter suetam adulationem laeti , quod Domitium Corbulonem retinendae Armeniae praeposuerat videbaturque locus virtutibus patefactus$$ All this however was described with exaggeration to the Senate ,  in the speeches of those members who proposed a public thanksgiving ,  and that on the days of the thanksgiving the prince should wear the triumphal robe and enter Rome in ovation ,  lastly ,  that he should have statues on the same scale as those of Mars the Avenger ,  and in the same temple To their habitual flattery was added a real joy at his having appointed Domitius Corbulo to secure Armenia ,  thus opening ,  as it seemed ,  a field to merit
 copiae Orientis ita dividuntur , ut pars auxiliarium cum duabus legionibus apud provinciam Syriam et legatum eius Quadratum Ummidium remaneret , par civium sociorumque numerus Corbuloni esset , additis cohortibus alisque , quae in Cappadocia hiemabant$$ The armies of the East were so divided that half the auxiliaries and two legions were to remain in the province of Syria under its governor ,  Quadratus Ummidius while Corbulo was to have an equal number of citizen and allied troops ,  together with the auxiliary infantry and cavalry which were in winter quarters in Cappadocia
 socii reges , prout bello conduceret , parere iussi$$ The confederate kings were instructed to obey orders ,  just as the war might require
 sed studia eorum in Corbulonem promptiora erant$$ But they had a specially strong liking for Corbulo
 qui ut instaret famae , quae in novis coeptis validissima est , itinere propere confecto apud Aegeas civitatem Ciliciae obvium Quadratum habuit , illuc progressum , ne , accipiendas copias Syriam intravisset Corbulo , omnium ora in se verteret , corpore ingens , verbis magnificis et super experientiam sapientiamque etiam specie inanium validus$$ That general ,  with a view to the prestige which in a new enterprise is supremely powerful ,  speedily accomplished his march ,  and at Aegeae ,  a city of Cilicia ,  met Quadratus who had advanced to the place under an apprehension that ,  should Corbulo once enter Armenia to take command of the army ,  he would draw all eyes on himself ,  by his noble stature ,  his imposing eloquence ,  and the impression he would make ,  not only by his wisdom and experience ,  but also by the mere display of showy attributes
 Eodem anno Caesar effigiem Gnaeus Domitio patri et consularia insignia Asconio Labeoni , quo tutore usus erat , petivit a senatu$$ The emperor in the same year asked the Senate for a statue to his father Domitius ,  and also that the consular decorations might be conferred on Asconius Labeo ,  who had been his guardian
 sibique statuas argento vel auro solidas adversus offerentes prohibuit et quamquam censuissent patres , ut principium anni mense Decembri , quo ortus erat Nero , veterem religionem kalendarum Ianuariarum inchoando anno retinuit$$ Statues to himself of solid gold and silver he forbade ,  in opposition to offers made ,  and although the Senate passed a vote that the year should begin with the month of December ,  in which he was born ,  he retained for its commencement ,  the old sacred associations of the first of January
 neque recepti sunt inter reos Carrinas Celer senator servo accusante , aut Iulius Densus equester Romanus , cui favor in Britannicum crimini dabatur$$ Nor would he allow the prosecution of Carinas Celer ,  a senator ,  whom a slave accused ,  or of Julius Densus ,  a knight ,  whose partiality for Britannicus was construed into a crime
 Ceterum infracta paulatim potentia matris delapso Nerone in amorem libertae , cui vocabulum Acte fuit , simul adsumptis in conscientiam Marcus Othone et Claudio Senecione , adulescentulis decoris , quorum Otho familia consulari , Senecio liberto Caesaris patre genitus$$ Meanwhile the mother's influence was gradually weakened ,  as Nero fell in love with a freedwoman ,  Acte by name ,  and took into his confidence Otho and Claudius Senecio ,  two young men of fashion ,  the first of whom was descended from a family of consular rank ,  while Senecio's father was one of the emperor's freedmen
 ignara matre , dein frustra obnitente , penitus inrepserat per luxum et ambigua secreta , ne senioribus quidem principis amicis adversantibus , muliercula nulla cuiusquam iniuria cupidines principis explente , quando uxore ab Octavia , nobili quidem et probitatis spectatae , fato quodam , an quia praevalent inlicita , abhorrebat , metuebaturque , ne in stupra feminarum inlustrium prorumperet , si illa libidine prohiberetur$$ Without the mother's knowledge ,  then in spite of her opposition ,  they had crept into his favour by debaucheries and equivocal secrets ,  and even the prince's older friends did not thwart him ,  for here was a girl who without harm to any one gratified his desires ,  when he loathed his wife Octavia ,  high born as she was ,  and of approved virtue ,  either from some fatality ,  or because vice is overpoweringly attractive It was feared too that he might rush into outrages on noble ladies ,  were he debarred from this indulgence
 Sed Agrippina libertam aemulam , nurum ancillam aliaque eundem in modum muliebriter fremere , neque paenitentiam filii aut satietatem opperiri , quantoque foediora exprobrabat , acrius accendere , donec vi amoris subactus exueret obsequium in matrem seque Senecae permitteret , ex cuius familiaribus Annaeus Serenus simulatione amoris adversus eandem libertam primas adulescentis cupidines velaverat praebueratque nomen , ut quae princeps furtim mulierculae tribuebat , ille palam largiretur$$ Agrippina ,  however ,  raved with a woman's fury about having a freedwoman for a rival ,  a slave girl for a daughter-in-law ,  with like expressions Nor would she wait till her son repented or wearied of his passion The fouler her reproaches ,  the more powerfully did they inflame him ,  till completely mastered by the strength of his desire ,  he threw off all respect for his mother ,  and put himself under the guidance of Seneca ,  one of whose friends ,  Annaeus Serenus ,  had veiled the young prince's intrigue in its beginning by pretending to be in love with the same woman ,  and had lent his name as the ostensible giver of the presents secretly sent by the emperor to the girl
 tum Agrippina versis artibus per blandimenta iuvenem adgredi , suum potius cubiculum ac sinum offerre contegendis quae prima aetas et summa fortuna expeterent$$ Then Agrippina ,  changing her tactics ,  plied the lad with various blandishments ,  and even offered the seclusion of her chamber for the concealment of indulgences which youth and the highest rank might claim
 quin et fatebatur intempestivam severitatem et suarum opum , quae haud procul imperatoriis aberant , copias tradebat , ut nimia nuper coercendo filio , ita rursum intemperanter demissa$$ She went further she pleaded guilty to an ill-timed strictness ,  and handed over to him the abundance of her wealth ,  which nearly approached the imperial treasures ,  and from having been of late extreme in her restraint of her son ,  became now ,  on the other hand ,  lax to excess
 quae mutatio neque Neronem fefellit , et proximi amicorum metuebant orabantque cavere insidias mulieris semper atrocis , tum et falsae$$ The change did not escape Nero his most intimate friends dreaded it ,  and begged him to beware of the arts of a woman ,  was always daring and was now false
 forte illis diebus Caesar inspecto ornatu , quo principium coniuges ac parentes effulserant , deligit vestem et gemmas misitque donum matri , nulla parsimonia , cum praecipua et cupita aliis prior deferret$$ It happened at this time that the emperor after inspecting the apparel in which wives and mothers of the imperial house had been seen to glitter ,  selected a jewelled robe and sent it as a gift to his mother ,  with the unsparing liberality of one who was bestowing by preference on her a choice and much coveted present
 sed Agrippina non his instrui cultus suos , sed ceteris arceri proclamat et dividere filium , quae cuncta ex ipsa haberet$$ Agrippina ,  however ,  publicly declared that so far from her wardrobe being furnished by these gifts ,  she was really kept out of the remainder ,  and that her son was merely dividing with her what he derived wholly from herself
 Turbatus his Nero et propinquo die , quo quartum decimum aetatis annum Britannicus explebat , volutare secum modo matris violentiam , modo ipsius indolem , levi quidem experimento nuper cognitam , quo tamen favorem late quaesivisset$$ Nero was confounded at this ,  and as the day was near on which Britannicus would complete his fourteenth year ,  he reflected ,  now on the domineering temper of his mother ,  and now again on the character of the young prince ,  which a trifling circumstance had lately tested ,  sufficient however to gain for him wide popularity
 festis Saturno diebus inter alia aequalium ludicra regnum lusu sortientium evenerat ea sors Neroni igitur ceteris diversa nec ruborem adlatura$$ During the feast of Saturn ,  amid other pastimes of his playmates ,  at a game of lot drawing for king ,  the lot fell to Nero ,  upon which he gave all his other companions different orders ,  and such as would not put them to the blush
 ubi Britannico iussit exsurgeret progressusque in medium cantum aliquem inciperet , inrisum ex eo sperans pueri sobrios quoque convictus , nedum temulentos ignorantis , ille constanter exorsus est carmen , quo evolutum eum sede patria rebusque summis significabatur$$ but when he told Britannicus to step forward and begin a song ,  hoping for a laugh at the expense of a boy who knew nothing of sober ,  much less of riotous society ,  the lad with perfect coolness commenced some verses which hinted at his expulsion from his father's house and from supreme power
 unde orta miseratio , manifestior quia dissimulationem nox et lascivia exemerat$$ This procured him pity ,  which was the more conspicuous ,  as night with its merriment had stript off all disguise
 Nero intellecta invidia odium intendit$$ Nero saw the reproach and redoubled his hate
 urgentibusque Agrippinae minis , quia nullum crimen neque iubere caedem fratris palam audebat , occulta molitur pararique venenum iubet , ministro Pollione Iulio praetoriae cohortis tribuno , cuius cura attinebatur damnata veneficii nomine Locusta , multa scelerum fama$$ Pressed by Agrippina's menaces ,  having no charge against his brother and not daring openly to order his murder ,  he meditated a secret device and directed poison to be prepared through the agency of Julius Pollio ,  tribune of one of the praetorian cohorts ,  who had in his custody a woman under sentence for poisoning ,  Locusta by name ,  with a vast reputation for crime
 nam ut proximus quisque Britannico neque fas neque fidem pensi haberet , olim provisum erat$$ That every one about the person of Britannicus should care nothing for right or honour ,  had long ago been provided for
 primum venenum ab ipsis educatoribus accepit , tramisitque exsoluta alvo parum validum , sive temperamentum inerat , ne statim saeviret$$ He actually received his first dose of poison from his tutors and passed it off his bowels ,  as it was rather weak or so qualified as not at once to prove deadly
 sed Nero lenti sceleris impatiens minitari tribuno , iubere supplicium veneficae , quod , dum rumorem respiciunt , dum parant defensiones , securitatem morarentur$$ But Nero ,  impatient at such slow progress in crime ,  threatened the tribune and ordered the poisoner to execution for prolonging his anxiety while they were thinking of the popular talk and planning their own defence
 promittentibus dein tam praecipitem necem , quam si ferro urgeretur , cubiculum Caesaris iuxta decoquitur virus cognitis antea venenis rapidum$$ Then they promised that death should be as sudden as if it were the hurried work of the dagger ,  and a rapid poison of previously tested ingredients was prepared close to the emperor's chamber
 Mos habebatur principum liberos cum ceteris idem aetatis nobilibus sedentes vesci in adspectu propinquorum propria et parciore mensa$$ It was customary for the imperial princes to sit during their meals with other nobles of the same age ,  in the sight of their kinsfolk ,  at a table of their own ,  furnished somewhat frugally
 illic epulante Britannico , quia cibos potusque eius delectus ex ministris gustu explorabat , ne omitteretur institutum aut utriusque morte proderetur scelus , talis dolus repertus est$$ There Britannicus was dining ,  and as what he ate and drank was always tested by the taste of a select attendant ,  the following device was contrived ,  that the usage might not be dropped or the crime betrayed by the death of both prince and attendant
 innoxia adhuc ac praecalida et libata gustu potio traditur Britannico$$ A cup as yet harmless ,  but extremely hot and already tasted ,  was handed to Britannicus
 dein , postquam fervore aspernabatur , frigida in aqua adfunditur venenum , quod ita cunctos eius artus pervasit , ut vox pariter et spiritus eius raperentur$$ then ,  on his refusing it because of its warmth ,  poison was poured in with some cold water ,  and this so penetrated his entire frame that he lost alike voice and breath
 trepidatur a circumsedentibus , diffugiunt imprudentes$$ There was a stir among the company
 at quibus altior intellectus , resistunt defixi et Neronem intuentes ille ut erat reclinis et nescio similis , solitum ita ait per comitialem morbum , quo prima ab infantia adflictaretur Britannicus , et redituros paulatim visus sensusque at Agrippinae is pavor , ea consternatio mentis , quamvis vultu premeretur , emicuit , ut perinde ignaram fuisse quam Octaviam sororem Britannici constiterit quippe sibi supremum auxilium ereptum et parricidii exemplum intellegebat$$ some ,  taken by surprise ,  ran hither and thither ,  while those whose discernment was keener ,  remained motionless ,  with their eyes fixed on Nero ,  who ,  as he still reclined in seeming unconsciousness ,  said that this was a common occurrence ,  from a periodical epilepsy ,  with which Britannicus had been afflicted from his earliest infancy ,  and that his sight and senses would gradually return As for Agrippina ,  her terror and confusion ,  though her countenance struggled to hide it ,  so visibly appeared ,  that she was clearly just as ignorant as was Octavia ,  Britannicus's own sister
 Octavia quoque , quamvis rudibus annis , dolorem caritatem omnes adfectus abscondere didicerat$$ She saw ,  in fact ,  that she was robbed of her only remaining refuge ,  and that here was a precedent for parricide
 ita post breve silentium repetita convivii laetitia$$ Even Octavia ,  notwithstanding her youthful inexperience ,  had learnt to hide her grief ,  her affection ,  and indeed every emotion
 Nox eadem necem Britannici et rogum coniunxit , proviso ante funebri paratu , qui modicus fuit in campo tamen Martis sepultus est , adeo turbidis imbribus , ut vulgus iram deum portendi crediderit adversus facinus , cui plerique etiam hominum ignoscebant , antiquas fratrum discordias et insociabile regnum aestimantes$$ And so after a brief pause the company resumed its mirth One and the same night witnessed Britannicus's death and funeral ,  preparations having been already made for his obsequies ,  which were on a humble scale He was however buried in the Campus Martius ,  amid storms so violent ,  that in the popular belief they portended the wrath of heaven against a crime which many were even inclined to forgive when they remembered the immemorial feuds of brothers and the impossibility of a divided throne
 tradunt plerique eorum temporum scriptores crebris ante exitium diebus inlusum isse pueritiae Britannici Neronem , ut iam non praematura neque saeva mors videri queat , quamvis inter sacra mensae , ne tempore quidem ad complexum sororum dato , ante oculos inimici properata sit in illum supremum Claudiorum sanguinem stupro prius quam veneno pollutum$$ It is related by several writers of the period that many days before the murder ,  Nero had offered the worst insult to the boyhood of Britannicus so that his death could no longer seem a premature or dreadful event ,  though it happened at the sacred board ,  without even a moment for the embraces of his sisters ,  hurried on too ,  as it was ,  under the eyes of an enemy ,  on the sole surviving offspring of the Claudii ,  the victim first of dishonour ,  then of poison
 festinationem exsequiarum edicto Caesar defendit , id a maioribus institutum referens , subtrahere oculis acerba funera neque laudationibus aut pompa detinere$$ The emperor apologised for the hasty funeral by reminding people that it was the practice of our ancestors to withdraw from view any grievously untimely death ,  and not to dwell on it with panegyrics or display
 ceterum et sibi amisso fratris auxilio reliquas spes in re publica sitas , et tanto magis fovendum patribus populoque principem , qui unus superesset e familia summum ad fastigium genita$$ For himself ,  he said ,  that as he had now lost a brother's help ,  his remaining hopes centred in the State ,  and all the more tenderness ought to be shown by the Senate and people towards a prince who was the only survivor of a family born to the highest greatness
 Exim largitione potissimos amicorum auxit$$ He then enriched his most powerful friends with liberal presents
 nec defuere qui arguerent viros gravitatem adseverantes , quod domos villas id temporis quasi praedam divisissent$$ Some there were who reproached men of austere professions with having on such an occasion divided houses and estates among themselves ,  like so much spoil
 alii necessitatem adhibitam credebant a principe , sceleris sibi conscio et veniam sperante , si largitionibus validissimum quemque obstrinxisset$$ It was the belief of others that a pressure had been put on them by the emperor ,  who ,  conscious as he was of guilt ,  hoped for merciful consideration if he could secure the most important men by wholesale bribery
 At matris ira nulla munificentia leniri , sed amplecti Octaviam , crebra cum amicis secreta habere , super ingenitam avaritiam undique pecunias quasi in subsidium corripiens , tribunos et centuriones comiter excipere , nomina et virtutes nobilium , qui etiam tum supererant , in honore habere , quasi quaereret ducem et partes$$ But his mother's rage no lavish bounty could allay She would clasp Octavia to her arms ,  and have many a secret interview with her friends with more than her natural rapacity ,  she clutched at money everywhere ,  seemingly for a reserve ,  and courteously received tribunes and centurions She honoured the names and virtues of the nobles who still were left ,  seeking apparently a party and a leader
 cognitum id Neroni , excubiasque militares , quae ut coniugi imperatoris olim , tum ut matri servabantur , et Germanos nuper eundem in honorem custodes additos digredi iubet$$ Of this Nero became aware ,  and he ordered the departure of the military guard now kept for the emperor's mother ,  as it had formerly been for the imperial consort ,  along with some German troops ,  added as a further honour
 ac ne coetu salutantium frequentaretur , separat domum matremque transfert in eam , quae Antoniae fuerat , quotiens ipse illuc ventitaret , saeptus turba centurionum et post breve osculum digrediens$$ He also gave her a separate establishment ,  that throngs of visitors might no longer wait on her ,  and removed her to what had been Antonia's house and whenever he went there himself ,  he was surrounded by a crowd of centurions ,  and used to leave her after a hurried kiss
 Nihil rerum mortalium tam instabile ac fluxum est quam fama potentiae non sua vi nixae$$ Of all things human the most precarious and transitory is a reputation for power which has no strong support of its own
 statim relictum Agrippinae limen$$ In a moment Agrippina's doors were deserted
 nemo solari , nemo adire praeter paucas feminas , amore an odio incertas$$ there was no one to comfort or to go near her ,  except a few ladies ,  whether out of love or malice was doubtful
 ex quibus erat Iunia Silana , quam matrimonio Gaius Sili a Messalina depulsam supra rettuli , insignis genere forma lascivia , et Agrippinae diu percara , mox occultis inter eas offensionibus , quia Sextium Africanum nobilem iuvenem a nuptiis Silanae deterruerat Agrippina , impudicam et vergentem annis dictitans , non ut Africanum sibi seponeret , sed ne opibus et orbitate Silanae maritus poteretur$$ One of these was Junia Silana ,  whom Messalina had driven from her husband ,  Caius Silius ,  as I have already related Conspicuous for her birth ,  her beauty ,  and her wantonness ,  she had long been a special favourite of Agrippina ,  till after a while there were secret mutual dislikes ,  because Sextius Africanus ,  a noble youth ,  had been deterred from marrying Silana by Agrippina ,  who repeatedly spoke of her as an immodest woman in the decline of life ,  not to secure Africanus for herself ,  but to keep the childless and wealthy widow out of a husband's control
 illa spe ultionis oblata parat accusatores ex clientibus suis Iturium et Calvisium , non vetera et saepius iam audita deferens , quod Britannici mortem lugeret aut Octaviae iniurias evulgaret , sed destinavisse eam Rubellium Plautum , per maternam originem pari ac Nero gradu a divo Augusto , ad res novas extollere coniugioque eius et imperio rem publicam rursus invadere$$ Silana having now a prospect of vengeance ,  suborned as accusers two of her creatures ,  Iturius and Calvisius ,  not with the old and often-repeated charges about Agrippina's mourning the death of Britannicus or publishing the wrongs of Octavia ,  but with a hint that it was her purpose to encourage in revolutionary designs Rubellius Plautus ,  who his mother's side was as nearly connected as Nero with the Divine Augustus
 haec Iturius et Calvisius Atimeto , Domitiae Neronis amitae liberto , aperiunt$$ and then ,  by marrying him and making him emperor ,  again seize the control of the State
 qui laetus oblatis (quippe inter Agrippinam et Domitiam infensa aemulatio exercebatur) Paridem histrionem , libertum et ipsum Domitiae , impulit ire propere crimenque atrociter deferre$$ All this Iturius and Calvisius divulged to Atimetus ,  a freedman of Domitia ,  Nero's aunt Exulting in the opportunity ,  for Agrippina and Domitia were in bitter rivalry ,  Atimetus urged Paris ,  who was himself also a freedman of Domitia ,  to go at once and put the charge in the most dreadful form
 Praefectura annonae Faenio Rufo , cura ludorum , qui a Caesare parabantur , Arruntio Stellae , Aegyptus Claudio Balbillo permittuntur Syria Publius Anteio destinata$$ The superintendence of the corn supply was given to Faenius Rufus ,  the direction of the games which the emperor was preparing ,  to Arruntius Stella ,  and the province of Egypt to Caius Balbillus
 sed variis mox artibus elusus , ad postremum in urbe retentus est at Silana in exilium acta$$ Syria was to be assigned to Publius Anteius ,  but he was soon put off by various artifices and finally detained at Rome
 Calvisius quoque et Iturius relegantur$$ Silana was banished Calvisius and Iturius exiled for a time
 de Atimeto supplicium sumptum , validiore apud libidines principis Paride , quam ut poena adficeretur$$ Atimetus was capitally punished ,  while Paris was too serviceable to the emperor's profligacy to allow of his suffering any penalty
 Plautus ad praesens silentio transmissus est$$ Plautus for the present was silently passed over
 Quintus Volusio Publius Scipione consulibus otium foris , foeda domi lascivia , qua Nero itinera urbis et lupanaria et deverticula veste servili in dissimulationem sui compositus pererrabat , comitantibus qui raperent venditioni exposita et obviis vulnera inferrent , adversus ignaros adeo , ut ipse quoque exciperet ictus et ore praeferret$$ In the consulship of Quintus Volusius and Publius Scipio ,  there was peace abroad ,  but a disgusting licentiousness at home on the part of Nero ,  who in a slave's disguise ,  so as to be unrecognized ,  would wander through the streets of Rome ,  to brothels and taverns ,  with comrades ,  who seized on goods exposed for sale and inflicted wounds on any whom they encountered ,  some of these last knowing him so little that he even received blows himself ,  and showed the marks of them in his face
 deinde ubi Caesarem esse , qui grassaretur , pernotuit augebanturque iniuriae adversus viros feminasque insignes , et quidam permissa semel licentia sub nomine Neronis inulti propriis cum globis eadem exercebant , in modum captivitatis nox agebatur$$ When it was notorious that the emperor was the assailant ,  and the insults on men and women of distinction were multiplied ,  other persons too on the strength of a licence once granted under Nero's name ,  ventured with impunity on the same practices ,  and had gangs of their own ,  till night presented the scenes of a captured city
 Iuliusque Montanus senatorii ordinis , sed qui nondum honorem capessisset , congressus forte per tenebras cum principe , quia vim temptantem acriter reppulerat , deinde adgnitum oraverat , quasi exprobrasset mori adactus est$$ Julius Montanus ,  a senator ,  but one who had not yet held any office ,  happened to encounter the prince in the darkness ,  and because he fiercely repulsed his attack and then on recognizing him begged for mercy ,  as though this was a reproach ,  forced to destroy himself
 Nero autem metuentior in posterum milites sibi et plerosque gladiatores circumdedit , qui rixarum initia modica et quasi privata sinerent$$ Nero was for the future more timid ,  and surrounded himself with soldiers and a number of gladiators ,  who ,  when a fray began on a small scale and seemed a private affair ,  were to let it alone ,  but ,  if the injured persons resisted stoutly ,  they rushed in with their swords
 si a laesis validius ageretur , arma inferebant ludicram quoque licentiam et fautores histrionum velut in proelia convertit impunitate et praemiis atque ipse occultus et plerumque coram prospectans , donec discordi populo et gravioris motus terrore non aliud remedium repertum est quam ut histriones Italia pellerentur milesque theatro rursum adsideret$$ He also turned the licence of the games and the enthusiasm for the actors into something like a battle by the impunity he allowed ,  and the rewards he offered ,  and especially by looking on himself ,  sometimes concealed ,  but often in public view ,  till ,  with the people at strife and the fear of a worse commotion ,  the only remedy which could be devised was the expulsion of the offending actors from Italy ,  and the presence once more of the soldiery in the theatre
 Per idem tempus actum in senatu de fraudibus libertorum , efflagitatumque ut adversus male meritos revocandae libertatis patronis daretur$$ During the same time there was a discussion in the Senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class ,  and a strong demand was made that ,  as a check on the undeserving ,  patrons should have the right of revoking freedom
 nec deerant qui censerent , sed consules , relationem incipere non ausi ignaro principe , perscripsere tamen consensum senatus ille an auctor constitutionis fieret ,    ut inter paucos et sententiae diversos , quibusdam coalitam libertate inreverentiam eo prorupisse frementibus , ut vine an aequo cum patronis iure agerent sententiam eorum consultarent ac verberibus manus ultro intenderent , impudenter vel poenam suam ipsi suadentes$$ There were several who supported this But the consuls did not venture to put the motion without the emperor's knowledge ,  though they recorded the Senate's general opinion ,  to see whether he would sanction the arrangement ,  considering that only a few were opposed to it ,  while some loudly complained that the irreverent spirit which freedom had fostered ,  had broken into such excess ,  that freedmen would ask their patrons' advice as to whether they should treat them with violence ,  or ,  as legally ,  their equals ,  and would actually threaten them with blows ,  at the same time recommending them not to punish
 quid enim aliud laeso patrono concessum , quam ut centesimum ultra lapidem in oram Campaniae libertum releget$$ What right ,  it was asked ,  was conceded to an injured patron but that of temporarily banishing the freedman a hundred miles off to the shores of Campania
 ceteras actiones promiscas et pares esse$$ In everything else ,  legal proceedings were equal and the same for both
 tribuendum aliquod telum , quod sperni nequeat$$ Some weapon ought to be given to the patrons which could not be despised
 nec grave manu missis per idem obsequium retinendi libertatem , per quod adsecuti sint$$ It would be no grievance for the enfranchised to have to keep their freedom by the same respectful behaviour which had procured it for them
 at criminum manifestos merito ad servitutem retrahi , ut metu coerceantur , quos beneficia non mutavissent$$ But ,  as for notorious offenders ,  they deserved to be dragged back into slavery ,  that fear might be a restraint where kindness had had no effect
 Disserebatur contra paucorum culpam ipsis exitiosam esse debere , nihil universorum iuri derogandum$$ It was argued in reply that ,  though the guilt of a few ought to be the ruin of the men themselves ,  there should be no diminution of the rights of the entire class
 quippe late fusum id corpus$$ For it was ,  they contended ,  a widely diffused body
 hinc plerumque tribus decurias , ministeria magistratibus et sacerdotibus , cohortes etiam in urbe conscriptas$$ from it ,  the city tribes ,  the various public functionaries ,  the establishments of the magistrates and priests were for the most part supplied ,  as well as the cohorts of the city-guard
 et plurimis equitum , plerisque senatoribus non aliunde originem trahi$$ very many too of the knights and several of the senators derived their origin from no other source
 si separarentur libertini , manifestam fore penuriam ingenuorum$$ If freedmen were to be a separate class ,  the paucity of the freeborn would be conspicuously apparent
 non frustra maiores , cum dignitatem ordinum dividerent , libertatem in communi posuisse$$ Not without good reason had our ancestors ,  in distinguishing the position of the different orders ,  thrown freedom open to all
 quin et manu mittendi duas species institutas , ut relinqueretur paenitentiae aut novo beneficio locus$$ Again ,  two kinds of enfranchisement had been instituted ,  so as to leave room for retracting the boon ,  or for a fresh act of grace
 quos vindicta patronus non liberaverit , velut vinclo servitutis attineri$$ Those whom the patron had not emancipated with the freedom-giving rod ,  were still held ,  as it were ,  by the bonds of slavery
 dispiceret quisque merita tardeque concederet , quod datum non adimeretur$$ Every master should carefully consider the merits of each case ,  and be slow to grant what once given could not be taken away
 haec sententia valuit , scripsitque Caesar senatui , privatim expenderent causam libertorum , quotiens a patronis arguerentur$$ This view prevailed ,  and the emperor replied to the Senate that ,  whenever freedmen were accused by their patrons ,  they were to investigate each case separately and not to annul any right to their common injury
 in commune nihil derogarent nec multo post ereptus amitae libertus Paris quasi iure civili , non sine infamia principis , cuius iussu perpetratum ingenuitatis iudicium erat$$ Soon afterwards ,  his aunt Domitia had her freedman Paris taken from her ,  avowedly by civil law ,  much to the emperor's disgrace ,  by whose direction a decision that he was freeborn was obtained
 Varie habita ac saepe mutata eius rei forma$$ The arrangement of this business had been variously and frequently altered
 nam Augustus senatui permisit deligere praefectos$$ Augustus allowed the Senate to appoint commissioners
 deinde ambitu suffragiorum suspecto , sorte ducebantur ex numero praetorum qui praeessent$$ then ,  when corrupt practices were suspected in the voting ,  men were chosen by lot for the office out of the whole number of praetors
 neque id diu mansit , quia sors deerrabat ad parum idoneos$$ This did not last long ,  as the lot strayed away to unfit persons
 tum Claudius quaestores rursum imposuit , iisque , ne metu offensionum segnius consulerent , extra ordinem honores promisit$$ Claudius then again appointed quaestors ,  and that they might not be too lax in their duties from fear of offending ,  he promised them promotion out of the usual course
 sed deerat robur aetatis eum primum magistratum capessentibus igitur Nero praetura perfunctos et experientia probatos delegit$$ But what they lacked was the firmness of mature age ,  entering ,  as they did ,  on this office as their first step ,  and so Nero appointed ex-praetors of approved competency
 Damnatus isdem consulibus Vipsanius Laenas ob Sardiniam provinciam avare habitam$$ During the same consulship ,  Vipsanius Laenas was condemned for rapacity in his administration of the province of Sardinia
 absolutus Cestius Proculus repetundarum Cretensibus accusantibus$$ Cestius Proculus was acquitted of extortion ,  his accusers dropping the charge
 Clodius Quirinalis , quod praefectus remigum , qui Ravennae haberentur , velut infimam nationum Italiam luxuria saevitiaque adflictavisset , veneno damnationem anteiit$$ Clodius Quirinalis ,  having ,  when in command of the crews at Ravenna ,  caused grievous distress to Italy by his profligacy and cruelty ,  just as if it were the most contemptible of countries ,  forestalled his doom by poison
 Caninius Rebilus , ex primoribus peritia legum et pecuniae magnitudine , cruciatus aegrae senectae misso per venas sanguine effugit , haud creditus sufficere ad constantiam sumendae mortis , ob libidines muliebriter infamis$$ Caninius Rebilus ,  one of the first men in legal knowledge and vastness of wealth ,  escaped the miseries of an old age of broken health by letting the blood trickle from his veins ,  though men did not credit him with sufficient resolution for a self-inflicted death ,  because of his infamous effeminacy
 at Lucius Volusius egregia fama concessit , cui tres et nonaginta anni spatium vivendi praecipuaeque opes bonis artibus , inoffensa tot imperatorum amicitia fuit$$ Lucius Volusius on the other hand died with a glorious name There was his long life of ninety-three years ,  his conspicuous wealth ,  honourably acquired ,  and his wise avoidance of the malignity of so many emperors
 Nerone iterum Lucius Pisone consulibus pauca memoria digna evenere , nisi cui libeat laudandis fundamentis et trabibus , quis molem amphitheatri apud campum Martis Caesar exstruxerat , volumina implere , cum ex dignitate populi Romani repertum sit res inlustres annalibus , talia diurnis urbis actis mandare$$ During Nero's second consulship with Lucius Piso for his colleague ,  little occurred deserving mention ,  unless one were to take pleasure in filling volumes with the praise of the foundations and timber work on which the emperor piled the immense amphitheatre in the Field of Mars But we have learnt that it suits the dignity of the Roman people to reserve history for great achievements ,  and to leave such details to the city's daily register
 ceterum coloniae Capua atque Nuceria additis veteranis firmatae sunt , plebeique congiarium quadrigeni nummi viritim dati , et sestertium quadringenties aerario inlatum est ad retinendam populi fidem$$ I may mention that the colonies of Nuceria and Capua were strengthened by an addition of veterans to every member of the city populace four hundred sesterces were given ,  and forty million paid into the exchequer to maintain the credit of the citizens
 vectigal quoque quintae et vicesimae venalium mancipiorum remissum , specie magis quam vi , quia , cum venditor pendere iuberetur , in partem pretii emptoribus adcrescebat$$ A tax also of four per cent on the sale of slaves was remitted ,  an apparent more than a real boon ,  for as the seller was ordered to pay it ,  purchasers found that it was added as part of the price
 et edixit Caesar , ne quis magistratus aut procurator in provincia , quam obtineret , spectaculum gladiatorum aut ferarum aut quod aliud ludicrum ederet$$ The emperor by an edict forbade any magistrate or procurator in the government of a province to exhibit a show of gladiators ,  or of wild beasts ,  or indeed any other public entertainment
 nam ante non minus tali largitione quam corripiendis pecuniis subiectos adfligebant , dum , quae libidine deliquerant , ambitu propugnant$$ for hitherto our subjects had been as much oppressed by such bribery as by actual extortion ,  while governors sought to screen by corruption the guilty deeds of arbitrary caprice

 longa huic Pomponiae aetas et continua tristitia fuit$$ This Pomponia lived a long life of unbroken melancholy
 nam post Iuliam Drusi filiam dolo Messalinae interfectam per quadraginta annos non cultu nisi lugubri , non animo nisi maesto egit$$ After the murder of Julia ,  Drusus's daughter ,  by Messalina's treachery ,  for forty years she wore only the attire of a mourner ,  with a heart ever sorrowful

 Cossutianum Capitonem Cilices detulerant , maculosum foedumque et idem ius audaciae in provincia ratum , quod in urbe exercuerat sed pervicaci accusatione conflictatus postremo defensionem omisit ac lege repetundarum damnatus est$$ Cossutianus Capito was accused by the people of Cilicia he was a man stained with the foulest guilt ,  and had actually imagined that his audacious wickedness had the same rights in a province as he had claimed for it at Rome But he had to confront a determined prosecution ,  and at last abandoned his defence

 Eius anni principio mollibus adhuc initiis prolatatum inter Parthos Romanosque de obtinenda Armenia bellum acriter sumitur , quia nec Vologaeses sinebat fratrem Tiridaten dati a se regni expertem esse aut alienae id potentiae donum habere , et Corbulo dignum magnitudine populi Romani rebatur parta olim a Lucullo Pompeioque recipere$$ Early in this year a war between Parthia and Rome about the possession of Armenia ,  which ,  feebly begun ,  had hitherto dragged on ,  was vigorously resumed For Vologeses would not allow his brother Tiridates to be deprived of a kingdom which he had himself given him ,  or to hold it as a gift from a foreign power ,  and Corbulo too thought it due to the grandeur of Rome that he should recover what Lucullus and Pompeius had formerly won
 ad hoc Armenii ambigua fide utraque arma invitabant , situ terrarum , similitudine morum Parthis propiores conubiisque permixti ac libertate ignota illuc magis ad servitium inclinantes$$ Besides ,  the Armenians in the fluctuations of their allegiance sought the armed protection of both empires ,  though by their country's position ,  by resemblance of manners ,  and by the ties of intermarriage ,  they were more connected with the Parthians ,  to whose subjection ,  in their ignorance of freedom ,  they rather inclined
 Interim Corbulo legionibus intra castra habitis , donec ver adolesceret , dispositisque per idoneos locos cohortibus auxiliariis , ne pugnam priores auderent praedicit$$ Meanwhile Corbulo kept his legions within the camp till spring weather was fairly established ,  and having stationed his auxiliary infantry at suitable points ,  he directed them not to begin an engagement

 et damno eius exterriti qui subsidium ferre debuerant , sua quisque in castra trepida fuga rediere$$ Panic-stricken by his disaster ,  those who ought to have given him support returned in precipitate flight to their respective encampments
 quod graviter Corbulo accepit increpitumque Paccium et praefectos militesque tendere extra vallum iussit$$ Corbulo heard of this with displeasure he sharply censured Paccius ,  the officers and soldiers ,  and ordered them to have their quarters outside the lines
 inque ea contumelia detenti nec nisi precibus universi exercitus exsoluti sunt$$ There they were kept in disgrace ,  and were released only on the intercession of the whole army
 At Tiridates super proprias clientelas ope Vologaesi fratris adiutus , non furtim iam , sed palam bello infensare Armeniam , quosque fidos nobis rebatur , depopulari , et si copiae contra ducerentur , eludere hucque et illuc volitans plura fama quam pugna exterrere$$ Tiridates meantime who ,  besides his own dependencies ,  had the powerful aid of his brother Vologeses ,  ravaged Armenia ,  not in stealthy raids as before ,  but in open war ,  plundering all whom he thought loyal to Rome ,  while he eluded an action with any force which was brought against him ,  and thus flying hither and thither ,  he spread panic more widely by rumour than by arms
 igitur Corbulo , quaesito diu proelio frustra habitus et exemplo hostium circumferre bellum coactus , dispertit vires , ut legati praefectique diversos locos pariter invaderent$$ So Corbulo ,  frustrated in his prolonged efforts to bring on an engagement and compelled ,  like the enemy ,  to carry hostilities everywhere ,  divided his army ,  so that his generals and officers might attack several points simultaneously
 simul regem Antiochum monet proximas sibi praefecturas petere nam Pharasmanes interfecto filio Radamisto quasi proditore , quo fidem in nos testaretur , vetus adversus Armenios odium promptius exercebat$$ He at the same time instructed king Antiochus to hasten to the provinces on his frontier ,  as Pharasmanes ,  after having slain his son Rhadamistus as a traitor to prove his loyalty to us ,  was following up more keenly than ever his old feud with the Armenians
 tuncque primum inlecti Moschi , gens ante alias socia Romanis , avia Armeniae incursavit$$ Then ,  for the first time ,  we won the friendship of the Moschi ,  a nation which became pre-eminently attached to Rome ,  and they overran the wilds of Armenia
 ita consilia Tiridati in contrarium vertebant , mittebatque oratores , qui suo Parthorumque nomine expostularent , cur datis nuper obsidibus redintegrataque amicitia quae novis quoque beneficiis locum aperiret , vetere Armeniae possessione depelleretur$$ Thus the intended plans of Tiridates were wholly reversed ,  and he sent envoys to ask on behalf of himself and of the Parthians ,  why ,  when hostages had lately been given and a friendship renewed which might open up a way to further acts of good will ,  he was thus driven from Armenia ,  his ancient possession
 ideo nondum ipsum Volgaesen commotum , quia causa quam vi agere mallent$$ As yet ,  he said ,  Vologeses had not bestirred himself ,  simply because they preferred negotiation to violence
 sin perstaretur in bello , non defore Arsacidis virtutem fortunamque saepius iam clade Romana expertam$$ Should however war be persisted in ,  the Arsacids would not want the courage and good fortune which had already been proved more than once by disaster to Rome
 ad ea Corbulo , satis comperto Volgaesen defectione Hyrcaniae attineri , suadet Tiridati precibus Caesarem adgredi posse illi regnum stabile et res incruentas contingere , si omissa spe longinqua et sera praesentem potioremque sequeretur$$ Corbulo in reply ,  when he was certain that Vologeses was detained by the revolt of Hyrcania ,  advised Tiridates to address a petition to the emperor ,  assuring him that he might reign securely and without bloodshed by relinquishing a prospect in the remote future for the sake of one more solid within his reach
 Placitum dehinc , qui commeantibus in vicem nuntiis nihil in summam pacis proficiebatur , colloquio ipsorum tempus locumque destinari$$ As no progress was made towards a final settlement of peace by the interchange of messages ,  it was at last decided to fix a time and a place for an interview between the leaders
 mille equitum praesidium Tiridates adfore sibi dicebat$$ A thousand troopers ,  Tiridates said ,  would be his escort
 quantum Corbuloni cuiusque generis militum adsisteret , non statuere , dum positis loricis et galeis in faciem pacis veniretur$$ what force of every kind was to be with Corbulo ,  he did not prescribe ,  provided they came in peaceful fashion ,  without breastplates and helmets
 cuicumque mortalium , nedum veteri et provido duci , barbarae astutiae patuissent ideo artum inde numerum finiri et hinc maiorem offerri , ut dolus pararetur$$ Any human being ,  to say nothing of an old and wary general ,  would have seen through the barbarian's cunning ,  which assigned a limited number on one side and offered a larger on the other ,  expressly with a treacherous intent
 nam equiti sagittarum usu exercito si detecta corpora obicerentur , nihil profuturam multitudinem$$ for ,  were they to be exposed to a cavalry trained in the use of arrows ,  with the person undefended ,  numbers would be unavailing
 dissimulato tamen intellectu rectius de iis , quae in publicum consulerentur , totis exercitibus coram dissertaturos respondit locumque delegit , cuius pars altera colles erant clementer adsurgentes accipiendis peditum ordinibus , pars in planitiem porrigebatur ad explicandas equitum turmas$$ Corbulo however ,  pretending not to understand this ,  replied that they would do better to discuss matters requiring consideration for their common good ,  in the presence of the entire armies ,  and he selected a place partly consisting of gently sloping hills ,  suited for ranks of infantry ,  partly ,  of a spreading plain where troops of cavalry could manoeuvre
 dieque pacto prior Corbulo socias cohortes et auxilia regum pro cornibus , medio sextam legionem constituit , cui accita per noctem aliis ex castris tria milia tertianorum permiscuerat , una cum aquila , quasi eadem legio spectaretur$$ On the appointed day ,  arriving first ,  he posted his allied infantry with the king's auxiliaries on the wings ,  the sixth legion in the centre ,  with which he had united three thousand men of the third ,  brought up in the night from another camp ,  with one eagle ,  so as to look like a single legion
 Tiridates vergente iam die procul adstitit , unde videri magis quam audiri posset$$ Tiridates towards evening showed himself at some distance whence he could be seen rather than heard
 ita sine congressu dux Romanus abscedere militem sua quemque in castra iubet$$ And so the Roman general ,  without any conference ,  ordered his troops to retire to their respective camps
 Rex sive fraudem suspectans , quia plura simul in loca ibatur , sive ut commeatus nostros Pontico mari et Trapezunte oppido adventantes interciperet , propere discedit$$ The king either suspecting a stratagem from these simultaneous movements in different directions ,  or intending to cut off our supplies as they were coming up from the sea of Pontus and the town of Trapezus ,  hastily withdrew
 sed neque commeatibus vim facere potuit , quia per montes ducebantur praesidiis nostris insessos , et Corbulo , ne inritum bellum traheretur utque Armenios ad sua defendenda cogeret , exscindere parat castella , sibique quod validissimum in ea praefectura , cognomento Volandum , sumit$$ He could not however make any attack on the supplies ,  as they were brought over mountains in the occupation of our forces Corbulo ,  that war might not be uselessly protracted ,  and also to compel the Armenians to defend their possessions ,  prepared to destroy their fortresses ,  himself undertaking the assault on the strongest of all in that province named Volandum
 minora Cornelio Flacco legato et Insteio Capitoni castrorum praefecto mandat$$ The weaker he assigned to Cornelius Flaccus ,  his lieutenant ,  and to Insteius Capito ,  his camp-prefect
 tum , circumspectis munimentis et quae expugnationi idonea provisis , hortatur milites , ut hostem vagum neque paci aut proelio paratum , sed perfidiam et ignaviam fuga confitentem exuerent sedibus gloriaeque pariter et praedae consulerent$$ Having then surveyed the defences and provided everything suitable for storming them ,  he exhorted his soldiers to strip of his home this vagabond foe who was preparing neither for peace nor for war ,  but who confessed his treachery and cowardice by flight ,  and so to secure alike glory and spoil
 tum quadripertito exercitu hos in testudinem conglobatos subruendo vallo inducit , alios scalas moenibus admovere , multos tormentis faces et hastas incutere iubet$$ Then forming his army into four divisions ,  he led one in the dense array of the testudo close up to the rampart ,  to undermine it ,  while others were ordered to apply scaling ladders to the walls ,  and many more were to discharge brands and javelins from engines
 libritoribus funditoribusque attributus locus , unde eminus glandes torquerent , ne qua pars subsidium laborantibus ferret pari undique metu$$ The slingers and artillerymen had a position assigned them from which to hurl their missiles at a distance ,  so that ,  with equal tumult everywhere ,  no support might be given from any point to such as were pressed
 tantus inde ardor certantis exercitus fuit , ut intra tertiam diei partem nudati propugnatoribus muri , obices portarum subversi , capta escensu munimenta omnesque puberes trucidati sint , nullo milite amisso , paucis admodum vulneratis$$ So impetuous were the efforts of the army that within a third part of one day the walls were stripped of their defenders ,  the barriers of the gates overthrown ,  the fortifications scaled and captured ,  and all the adult inhabitants massacred ,  without the loss of a soldier and with but very few wounded
 et imbelle vulgus sub corona venundatum , reliqua praeda victoribus cessit$$ The nonmilitary population were sold by auction
 pari fortuna legatus ac praefectus usi sunt , tribusque una die castellis expugnatis cetera terrore et alia sponte incolarum in deditionem veniebant$$ the rest of the booty fell to the conquerors Corbulo's lieutenant and camp-prefect met with similar success
 unde orta fiducia caput gentis Artaxata adgrediendi$$ three forts were stormed by them in one day ,  and the remainder ,  some from panic ,  others by the consent of the occupants ,  capitulated
 nec tamen proximo itinere ductae legiones , qua si amnem Araxen , qui moenia adluit , ponte transgrederentur , sub ictum dabantur$$ This inspired them with confidence to attack the capital of the country ,  Artaxata
 procul et latioribus vadis transiere$$ The legions however were not marched by the nearest route ,  for should they cross the river Avaxes which washes the city's walls by a bridge ,  they would be within missile-range
 Et Corbulo castra in loco metatus , an expeditis legionibus nocte Artaxata pergeret obsidioque circumdaret agitavit , concessisse illuc Tiridaten ratus$$ Corbulo then encamped on the spot ,  and considered whether he should push on his legions without their baggage to Artaxata and blockade the city ,  on which ,  he supposed ,  Tiridates had fallen back
 dein postquam exploratores attulere longinquum regis iter et Medi an Albani peterentur incertum , lucem opperitur , praemissaque levis armatura , quae muros interim ambiret oppugnationemque eminus inciperet$$ When his scouts reported that the king had undertaken a long march ,  and that it was doubtful whether Media or Albania was its destination ,  he waited for daylight ,  and then sent on his light-armed troops ,  which were meanwhile to hover round the walls and begin the attack from a distance
 sed oppidani portis sponte patefactis se suaque Romanis permisere$$ The inhabitants however opened the gates of their own accord ,  and surrendered themselves and their property to the Romans
 quod salutem ipsis tulit$$ This saved their lives
 Artaxatis ignis immissus deletaque et solo aequata sunt , qui nec teneri poterant sine valido praesidio ob magnitudinem moenium , nec id nobis virium erat , quod firmando praesidio et capessendo bello divideretur , vel , si integra et incustodita relinquerentur , nulla in eo utilitas aut gloria , quod capta essent$$ the city was fired ,  demolished and levelled to the ground ,  as it could not be held without a strong garrison from the extent of the walls ,  and we had not sufficient force to be divided between adequately garrisoning it and carrying on the war If again the place were left untouched and unguarded ,  no advantage or glory would accrue from its capture
 adicitur miraculum velut numine oblatum$$ Then too there was a wonderful occurrence ,  almost a divine interposition
 nam cuncta extra tectis hactenus sole inlustria fuere repente quod moenibus cingebatur ita atra nube coopertum fulgoribusque discretum est , ut quasi infensantibus deis exitio tradi crederetur$$ While the whole space outside the town ,  up to its buildings ,  was bright with sunlight ,  the enclosure within the walls was suddenly shrouded in a black cloud ,  seamed with lightning-flashes ,  and thus the city was thought to be given up to destruction ,  as if heaven was wroth against it
 Ob haec consalutatus imperator Nero , et senatus consulto supplicationes habitae , statuaeque et arcus et continui consulatus principi , utque inter festos referretur dies , quo patrata victoria , quo nuntiata , quo relatum de ea esset , aliaque in eandem formam decernuntur , adeo modum egressa , ut Gaius Cassius de ceteris honoribus adsensus , si pro benignitate fortunae dis grates agerentur , ne totum quidem annum supplicationibus sufficere disseruerit , eoque oportere dividi sacros et negotiosos dies , quis divina colerent et humana non impedirent$$ For all this Nero was unanimously saluted emperor ,  and by the Senate's decree a thanksgiving was held statues also ,  arches and successive consulships were voted to him ,  and among the holy days were to be included the day on which the victory was won ,  that on which it was announced ,  and that on which the motion was brought forward Other proposals too of a like kind were carried ,  on a scale so extravagant ,  that Caius Cassius ,  after having assented to the rest of the honours ,  argued that if the gods were to be thanked for the bountiful favours of fortune ,  even a whole year would not suffice for thanksgivings ,  and therefore there ought to be a classification of sacred and business-days ,  that so they might observe divine ordinances and yet not interfer with human affairs
 Variis deinde casibus iactatus et multorum odia meritus reus , haud tamen sine invidia Senecae damnatur$$ A man who had struggled with various calamities and earned the hate of many ,  was then impeached and condemned ,  but not without angry feelings towards Seneca
 is fuit Publius Suillius , imperitante Claudio terribilis ac venalis et mutatione temporum non quantum inimici cuperent demissus quique se nocentem videri quam supplicem mallet$$ This was Publius Suilius He had been terrible and venal ,  while Claudius reigned ,  and when times were changed ,  he was not so much humbled as his enemies wished ,  and was one who would rather seem a criminal than a suppliant
 eius opprimendi gratia repetitum credebatur senatus consultum poenaque Cinciae legis adversum eos , qui pretio causas oravissent$$ With the intent of crushing him ,  so men believed ,  a decree of the Senate was revived ,  along with the penalty of the Cincian law against persons who had pleaded for hire
 nec Suillius questu aut exprobratione abstinebat , praeter ferociam animi extrema senecta liber et Senecam increpans infensum amicis Claudii , sub quo iustissimum exilium pertulisset$$ Suilius spared not complaint or indignant remonstrance freespoken because of his extreme age as well as from his insolent temper ,  he taunted Seneca with his savage enmity against the friends of Claudius ,  under whose reign he had endured a most righteously deserved exile
 simul studiis inertibus et iuvenum imperitiae suetum livere iis , qui vividam et incorruptam eloquentiam tuendis civibus exercerent$$ The man ,  he said ,  familiar as he was only with profitless studies ,  and with the ignorance of boyhood ,  envied those who employed a lively and genuine eloquence in the defence of their fellow-citizens
 se quaestorem Germanici , illum domus eius adulterum fuisse$$ He had been Germanicus's quaestor ,  while Seneca had been a paramour in his house
 an gravius aestimandum sponte litigatoris praemium honestae operae adsequi quam corrumpere cubicula principum feminarum$$ Was it to be thought a worse offence to obtain a reward for honest service with the litigant's consent ,  than to pollute the chambers of the imperial ladies
 qua sapientia , quibus philosophorum praeceptis intra quadriennium regiae amicitiae ter milies sestertium paravisset$$ By what kind of wisdom or maxims of philosophy had Seneca within four years of royal favour amassed three hundred million sesterces
 Romae testamenta et orbos velut indagine eius capi , Italiam et provincias immenso faenore hauriri$$ At Rome the wills of the childless were ,  so to say ,  caught in his snare while Italy and the provinces were drained by a boundless usury
 at sibi labore quaesitam et modicam pecuniam esse$$ His own money ,  on the other hand ,  had been acquired by industry and was not excessive
 crimen , periculum , omnia potius toleraturum , quam veterem ac domi partam dignationem subitae felicitati submitteret$$ He would suffer prosecutions ,  perils ,  anything indeed rather than make an old and self-learned position of honour to bow before an upstart prosperity
 Nec deerant qui haec isdem verbis aut versa in deterius Senecae deferrent$$ Persons were not wanting to report all this to Seneca ,  in the exact words ,  or with a worse sense put on it
 repertique accusatores direptos socios , cum Suillius provinciam Asiam regeret , ac publicae pecuniae peculatum detulerunt$$ Accusers were also found who alleged that our allies had been plundered ,  when Suilius governed the province of Asia ,  and that there had been embezzlement of public monies
 mox , quia inquisitionem annuam impetraverant , brevius visum sub urbana crimina incipi , quorum obvii testes erant$$ Then ,  as an entire year had been granted to them for inquiries ,  it seemed a shorter plan to begin with his crimes at Rome ,  the witnesses of which were on the spot
 ii acerbitate accusationis Quintus Pomponium ad necessitatem belli civilis detrusum , Iuliam Drusi filiam Sabinamque Poppaeam ad mortem actas et Valerium Asiaticum , Lusium Saturninum , Cornelium Lupum circumventos , iam equitum Romanorum agmina damnata omnemque Claudii saevitiam Suillio obiectabant$$ These men charged Suilius with having driven Quintus Pomponius by a relentless prosecution into the extremity of civil war ,  with having forced Julia ,  Drusus's daughter ,  and Sabina Poppaea to suicide ,  with having treacherously ruined Valerius Asiaticus ,  Lusius Saturninus and Cornelius Lupus ,  in fact ,  with the wholesale conviction of troops of Roman knights ,  and with all the cruelty of Claudius
 ille nihil ex his sponte susceptum , sed principi paruisse defendebat , donec eam orationem Caesar cohibuit , compertum sibi referens ex commentariis patris sui nullam cuiusquam accusationem ab eo coactam$$ His defence was that of all this he had done nothing on his own responsibility but had simply obeyed the emperor ,  till Nero stopped such pleadings ,  by stating that he had ascertained from his father's notebooks that he had never compelled the prosecution of a single person
 tum iussa Messalinae praetendi et labare defensio$$ Suilius then sheltered himself under Messalina's orders ,  and the defence began to collapse
 cur enim neminem alium delectum , qui saevienti impudicae vocem praeberet$$ Why ,  it was asked ,  was no one else chosen to put his tongue at the service of that savage harlot
 puniendos rerum atrocium ministros , ubi pretia scelerum adepti scelera ipsa aliis delegent$$ We must punish the instruments of atrocious acts ,  when ,  having gained the rewards of wickedness ,  they impute the wickedness to others
 igitur adempta bonorum parte (nam filio et nepti pars concedebatur eximebanturque etiam quae testamento matris aut aviae acceperant) in insulas Baleares pellitur , non in ipso discrimine , non post damnationem fractus animo$$ And so ,  with the loss of half his property ,  his son and granddaughter being allowed to retain the other half ,  and what they had inherited under their mother's or grandmother's will being also exempted from confiscation ,  Suilius was banished to the Balearic isles
 ferebaturque copiosa et molli vita secretum illud toleravisse$$ Neither in the crisis of his peril nor after his condemnation did he quail in spirit
 filium eius Nerullinum adgressis accusatoribus per invidiam patris et crimina repetundarum , intercessit princeps tamquam satis expleta ultione$$ Rumour said that he supported that lonely exile by a life of ease and plenty When the accusers attacked his son Nerullinus on the strength of men's hatred of the father and of some charges of extortion ,  the emperor interposed ,  as if implying that vengeange was fully satisfied

 Otho sive amore incautus laudare formam elegantiamque uxoris apud principem , sive ut accenderet ac , si eadem femina potirentur , id quoque vinculum potentiam ei adiceret$$ Otho now began to praise his wife's beauty and accomplishments to the emperor ,  either from a lover's thoughtlessness or to inflame Nero's passion ,  in the hope of adding to his own influence by the further tie which would arise out of possession of the same woman

Thrasea contra , rationem poscentibus amicis , non praesentium ignarum respondebat eius modi consulta corrigere , sed patrum honori dare , ut manifestum fieret magnarum rerum curam non dissimulaturos , qui animum etiam levissimis adverterent$$ But if the highest affairs were passed by and ignored ,  how much more ought there to be no meddling with things wholly insignificant Thrasea in reply ,  when his friends asked an explanation ,  said that it was not in ignorance of Rome's actual condition that he sought to correct such decrees ,  but that he was giving what was due to the honour of the senators ,  in making it evident that those who attended even to the merest trifles ,  would not disguise their responsibility for important affairs
 Eodem anno crebris populi flagitationibus , immodestiam publicanorum arguentis , dubitavit Nero , an cuncta vectigalia omitti iuberet idque pulcherrimum donum generi mortalium daret$$ That same year ,  repeated demands on the part of the people ,  who denounced the excessive greed of the revenue collectors ,  made Nero doubt whether he should not order the repeal of all indirect taxes ,  and so confer a most splendid boon on the human race
 sed impetum eius , multum prius laudata magnitudine animi , attinuere seniores , dissolutionem imperii docendo , si fructus , quibus res publica sustineretur , deminuerentur$$ But this sudden impulse was checked by the senators ,  who ,  having first heartily praised the grandeur of his conception ,  pointed out that the dissolution of the empire must ensue if the revenues which supported the State were to be diminished
 quippe sublatis portoriis sequens , ut tributorum abolitio expostularetur$$ for as soon as the customs were swept away ,  there would follow a demand for the abolition of the direct taxes
 plerasque vectigalium societates a consulibus et tribunis plebis constitutas acri etiam tum populi Romani libertate reliqua mox ita provisa , ut ratio quaestuum et necessitas erogationum inter se congruerent$$ Many companies for the collection of the indirect taxes had been formed by consuls and tribunes ,  when the freedom of the Roman people was still in its vigour ,  and arrangements were subsequently made to insure an exact correspondence between the amount of income and the necessary disbursements
 temperandas plane publicanorum cupidines , ne per tot annos sine querela tolerata novis acerbitatibus ad invidiam verterent$$ Certainly some restraint ,  they admitted ,  must be put on the cupidity of the revenue collectors ,  that they might not by new oppressions bring into odium what for so many years had been endured without a complaint
 Ergo edixit princeps , ut leges cuiusque publici , occultae ad id tempus , proscriberentur$$ Accordingly the emperor issued an edict that the regulations about every branch of the public revenue ,  which had hitherto been kept secret ,  should be published
 omissas petitiones non ultra annum resumerent$$ that claims which had been dropped should not be revived after a year
 Romae praetor , per provincias qui pro praetore aut consule essent iura adversus publicanos extra ordinem redderent$$ that the praetor at Rome ,  the propraetor or proconsul in the provinces ,  should give judicial precedence to all cases against the collectors
 militibus immunitas servaretur , nisi in iis , quae veno exercerent aliaque admodum aequa , quae brevi servata , dein frustra habita sunt$$ that the soldiers should retain their immunities except when they traded for profit ,  with other very equitable arrangements ,  which for a short time were maintained and were subsequently disregarded
 manet tamen abolitio quadragesimae quinquagesimaeque et quae alia exactionibus inlicitis nomina publicani invenerant$$ However ,  the repeal of the two per cent and two-and-a-half per cent taxes remains in force ,  as well as that of others bearing names invented by the collectors to cover their illegal exactions
 temperata apud transmarinas provincias frumenti subvectio , et , ne censibus negotiatorum naves adscriberentur tributumque pro illis penderent , constitutum$$ In our transmarine provinces the conveyance of corn was rendered less costly ,  and it was decided that merchant ships should not be assessed with their owner's property ,  and that no tax should be paid on them
 Quietae ad id tempus res in Germania fuerant , ingenio ducum , qui pervulgatis triumphi insignibus maius ex eo decus sperabant , si pacem continuavissent$$ Up to this time everything had been quiet in Germany ,  from the temper of the generals ,  who ,  now that triumphal decorations had been vulgarised ,  hoped for greater glory by the maintenance of peace
 Paulinus Pompeius et Lucius Vetus ea tempestate exercitui praeerant$$ Paulinus Pompeius and Lucius Vetus were then in command of the army
 ne tamen segnem militem attinerent , ille inchoatum ante tres et sexaginta annos a Druso aggerem coercendo Rheno absolvit , Vetus Mosellam atque Ararim facta inter utrumque fossa conectere parabat , ut copiae per mare , dein Rhodano et Arare subvectae per eam fossam , mox fluvio Mosella in Rhenum , exim Oceanum decurrerent , sublatisque itineris difficultatibus navigabilia inter se Occidentis Septentrionisque litora fierent$$ Still ,  to avoid keeping the soldiers in idleness ,  the first completed the embankment begun sixty-three years before by Drusus to confine the waters of the Rhine ,  while Vetus prepared to connect the Moselle and the Arar by a canal ,  so that troops crossing the sea and then conveyed on the Rhone and Arar might sail by this canal into the Moselle and the Rhine ,  and thence to the ocean Thus the difficulties of the route being removed ,  there would be communication for ships between the shores of the west and of the north
 invidit operi Aelius Gracilis Belgicae legatus , deterrendo Veterem , ne legiones alienae provinciae inferret studiaque Galliarum adfectaret , formidolosum id imperatori dictitans , quo plerumque prohibentur conatus honesti$$ Aelius Gracilis ,  the governor of Belgica ,  discouraged the work by seeking to deter Vetus from bringing his legions into another man's province ,  and so drawing to himself the attachment of Gaul This result he repeatedly said would excite the fears of the emperor ,  an assertion by which meritorious undertakings are often hindered
 Ceterum continuo exercituum otio fama incessit ereptum ius legatis ducendi in hostem$$ Meantime ,  from the continued inaction of our armies ,  a rumour prevailed that the commanders had been deprived of the right of leading them against the enemy
 eoque Frisii iuventutem saltibus aut paludibus , imbellem aetatem per lacus admovere ripae agrosque vacuos et militum usui sepositos insedere , auctore Verrito et Malorige , qui nationem eam regebant , in quantum Germani regnantur$$ Thereupon the Frisii moved up their youth to the forests and swamps ,  and their non-fighting population ,  over the lakes ,  to the river-bank ,  and established themselves in unoccupied lands ,  reserved for the use of our soldiers ,  under the leadership of Verritus and Malorix ,  the kings of the tribe ,  as far as Germans are under kings
 iamque fixerant domos , semina arvis intulerant utque patrium solum exercebant , cum Dubius Avitus , accepta a Paulino provincia , minitando vim Romanam , nisi abscederent Frisii veteres in locos aut novam sedem a Caesare impetrarent , perpulit Verritum et Malorigem preces suscipere$$ Already they had settled themselves in houses ,  had sown the fields ,  and were cultivating the soil as if it had been their ancestors' ,  when Dubius Avitus ,  who had succeeded Paulinus in the province ,  by threatening them with a Roman attack if they did not retire into their old country or obtain a new territory from the emperor ,  constrained Verritus and Malorix to become suppliants
 profectique Romam , dum aliis curis intentum Neronem opperiuntur , inter ea , quae barbaris ostentantur , intravere Pompei theatrum , quo magnitudinem populi viserent$$ They went to Rome ,  and while they waited for Nero ,  who was intent on other engagements ,  among the sights shown to the barbarians they were admitted into Pompey's theatre ,  where they might behold the vastness of the Roman people
 illic per otium (neque enim ludicris ignari oblectabantur) dum consessum caveae , discrimina ordinum , quis eques , ubi senatus , percunctantur , advertere quosdam cultu externo in sedibus senatorum$$ There at their leisure (for in the entertainment ,  ignorant as they were ,  they found no amusement) they asked questions about the crowd on the benches ,  about the distinctions of classes ,  who were the knights ,  where was the Senate ,  till they observed some persons in a foreign dress on the seats of the senators
 et quinam forent rogitantes , postquam audiverant earum gentium legatis id honoris datum , quae virtute et amicitia Romana praecellerent , nullos mortalium armis aut fide ante Germanos esse exclamant degrediunturque et inter patres considunt$$ Having asked who they were ,  when they were told that this honour was granted to envoys from those nations which were distinguished for their bravery and their friendship to Rome ,  they exclaimed that no men on earth surpassed the Germans in arms or in loyalty
 quod comiter a visentibus exceptum , quasi impetus antiqui et bona aemulatione$$ Then they went down and took their seat among the senators
 Nero civitate Romana ambos donavit , Frisios decedere agris iussit$$ The spectators hailed the act goodnaturedly ,  as due to the impulsiveness of a primitive people and to an honourable rivalry
 atque illis aspernantibus auxiliaris eques repente immissus necessitatem attulit , captis caesisve qui pervicacius restiterant$$ Nero gave both of them the Roman franchise ,  and ordered the Frisii to withdraw from the territory in question
 Eosdem agros Ampsivarii occupavere , validior gens non modo sua copia , sed adiacentium populorum miseratione , qui pulsi a Chaucis et sedis inopes tutum exilium orabant$$ Of this same territory ,  the Ampsivarii now possessed themselves ,  a tribe more powerful not only from their numbers ,  but from having the sympathy of the neighbouring peoples ,  as they had been expelled by the Chauci and had to beg ,  as homeless outcasts ,  a secure exile
 aderatque iis clarus per illas gentes et nobis quoque fidus nomine Boiocalus , vinctum se rebellione Cherusca iussu Arminii referens , mox Tiberio et Germanico ducibus stipendia meruisse , et quinquaginta annorum obsequio id quoque adiungere , quod gentem suam dicioni nostrae subiceret$$ Their cause was pleaded by a man ,  famous among those nations and loyal to Rome ,  Boiocalus by name ,  who reminded us that on the Cheruscan revolt he had been imprisoned by the order of Arminius ,  that afterwards he had served under the leadership of Tiberius and of Germanicus ,  and that to a fifty years' obedience he was adding the merit of subjecting his tribe to our dominion
 quotam partem campi iacere , in quam pecora et armenta militum aliquando transmitterentur! servarent sane receptus gregibus inter hominum famem , modo ne vastitatem et solitudinem mallent quam amicos populos$$ What an extent of plain ,  he would say ,  lies open into which the flocks and herds of the Roman soldiers may some day be sent! Let them by all means keep retreats for their cattle ,  while men are starving only let them not prefer a waste and a solitude to friendly nations
 Chamavorum quondam ea arva , mox Tubantum et post Usiporum fuisse$$ Once these fields belonged to the Chamavi
 sicuti caelum deis , ita terras generi mortalium datas$$ then to the Tubantes
 quaeque vacuae , eas publicas esse$$ after them to the Usipii
 solum inde suspiciens et cetera sidera vocans quasi coram interrogabat , vellentne contueri inane solum$$ As heaven is for the gods ,  so the earth has been given to mankind ,  and lands uninhabited are common to all
 potius mare superfunderent adversus terrarum ereptores$$ Then looking up to the sun and invoking the other heavenly bodies ,  he asked them ,  as though standing in their presence ,  whether they wished to behold an empty soil
 Et commotus his Avitus$$ Avitus was impressed by this language and said that people must submit to the rule of their betters
 patienda meliorum imperia id dis , quos implorarent , placitum , ut arbitrium penes Romanos maneret , quid darent quid adimerent , neque alios iudices quam se ipsos paterentur$$ that the gods to whom they appealed ,  had willed that the decision as to what should be given or taken from them ,  was to rest with the Romans ,  who would allow none but themselves to be judges
 haec an in publicum Ampsivariis respondit , ipsi Boiocalo ob memoriam amicitiae daturum agros$$ This was his public answer to the Ampsivarii to Boiocalus his reply was that in remembrance of past friendship he would cede the lands in question
 quod ille ut proditionis pretium aspernatus addidit deesse nobis terra ubi vivamus , in qua moriamur , non potest$$ Boiocalus spurned the offer as the price of treason ,  adding ,  We may lack a land to live in
 atque ita infensis utrimque animis discessum$$ we cannot lack one to die in
 illi Bructeros , Tencteros , ulteriores etiam nationes socias bello vocabant$$ And so they parted with mutual exasperation
 Avitus scripto ad Curtilium Manciam superioris exercitum legatum , ut Rhenum transgressus arma a tergo ostenderet , ipse legiones in agrum Tencterum induxit , excidium minitans , ni causam suam dissociarent igitur absistentibus his pari metu exterriti Bructeri$$ The Ampsivarii now called on the Bructeri ,  the Tencteri ,  and yet more distant tribes to be their allies in war Avitus ,  having written to Curtilius Mancia ,  commander of the Upper army ,  asking him to cross the Rhine and display his troops in the enemy's rear ,  himself led his legions into the territory of the Tencteri ,  and threatened them with extermination unless they dissociated themselves from the cause
 et ceteris quoque aliena pericula deserentibus sola Ampsivariorum gens retro ad Usipos et Tubantes concessit$$ When upon this the Tencteri stood aloof ,  the Bructeri were cowed by a like terror
 quorum terris exacti cum Chattos , dein Cheruscos petissent , errore longo hospites , egeni , hostes in alieno quod iuventutis erat caeduntur , imbellis aetas in praedam divisa est$$ And so ,  as the rest too were for averting perils which did not concern them ,  the Ampsivarian tribe in its isolation retreated to the Usipii and Tubantes Driven out of these countries ,  they sought refuge with the Chatti and then with the Cherusci ,  and after long wanderings ,  as destitute outcasts ,  received now as friends now as foes ,  their entire youth were slain in a strange land ,  and all who could not fight ,  were apportioned as booty
 Eadem aestate inter Hermunduros Chattosque certatum magno proelio , dum flumen gignendo sale fecundum et conterminum vi trahunt , super libidinem cuncta armis agendi religione insita , eos maxime locos propinquare caelo precesque mortalium a deis nusquam propius audiri$$ The same summer a great battle was fought between the Hermunduri and the Chatti ,  both forcibly claiming a river which produced salt in plenty ,  and bounded their territories They had not only a passion for settling every question by arms ,  but also a deep-rooted superstition that such localities are specially near to heaven ,  and that mortal prayers are nowhere more attentively heard by the gods
 inde indulgentia numinum illo in amne illisque silvis salem provenire , non ut alias apud gentes eluvie maris arescente , sed unda super ardentem arborum struem fusa ex contrariis inter se elementis , igne atque aquis , concretum$$ It is ,  they think ,  through the bounty of divine power ,  that in that river and in those forests salt is produced ,  not ,  as in other countries ,  by the drying up of an overflow of the sea ,  but by the combination of two opposite elements ,  fire and water ,  when the latter had been poured over a burning pile of wood
 sed bellum hermunduris prosperum , Chattis exitiosius fuit , quia victores diversam aciem marti ac Mercurio sacravere , quo voto equi viri , cuncta viva occidioni dantur$$ The war was a success for the Hermunduri ,  and the more disastrous to the Chatti because they had devoted ,  in the event of victory ,  the enemy's army to Mars and Mercury ,  a vow which consigns horses ,  men ,  everything indeed on the vanquished side to destruction
 et minae quidem hostiles in ipsos vertebant$$ And so the hostile threat recoiled on themselves
 sed civitas Ubiorum socia nobis malo improviso adflicta est$$ Meanwhile ,  a state in alliance with us ,  that of the Ubii ,  suffered grievously from an unexpected calamity
 nam ignes terra editi villas arva vicos passim corripiebant ferebanturque in ipsa conditae nuper coloniae moenia$$ Fires suddenly bursting from the earth seized everywhere on country houses ,  crops ,  and villages ,  and were rushing on to the very walls of the newly founded colony
 neque exstingui poterant , non si imbres caderent , non si fluvialibus aquis aut quo alio humore , donec inopia remedii et ira cladis agrestes quidam eminus saxa iacere , dein residentibus flammis propius suggressi ictu fustium aliisque verberibus ut feras absterrebant$$ Nor could they be extinguished by the fall of rain ,  or by river-water ,  or by any other moisture ,  till some countrymen ,  in despair of a remedy and in fury at the disaster ,  flung stones from a distance ,  and then ,  approaching nearer ,  as the flames began to sink ,  tried to scare them away ,  like so many wild beasts ,  with the blows of clubs and other weapons
 postremo tegmina corpori derepta iniciunt , quanto magis profana et usu polluta , tanto magis oppressura ignes$$ At last they stript off their clothes and threw them on the fire ,  which they were the more likely to quench ,  the more they had been soiled by common use
 Gaio Vipstano Gaius Fonteio consulibus diu meditatum scelus non ultra Nero distulit , vetustate imperii coalita audacia et flagrantior in dies amore Poppaeae , quae sibi matrimonium et discidium Octaviae incolumi Agrippina haud sperans crebris criminationibus , aliquando per facetias incusare principem et pupillum vocare , qui iussis alienis obnoxius non modo imperii , sed libertatis etiam indigeret$$ In the year of the consulship of Caius Vipstanus and Caius Fonteius ,  Nero deferred no more a long meditated crime Length of power had matured his daring ,  and his passion for Poppaea daily grew more ardent As the woman had no hope of marriage for herself or of Octavia's divorce while Agrippina lived ,  she would reproach the emperor with incessant vituperation and sometimes call him in jest a mere ward who was under the rule of others ,  and was so far from having empire that he had not even his liberty
 cur enim differri nuptias suas$$ Why ,  she asked ,  was her marriage put off
 formam scilicet displicere et triumphales avos , an fecunditatem et verum animum$$ Was it ,  forsooth ,  her beauty and her ancestors ,  with their triumphal honours ,  that failed to please ,  or her being a mother ,  and her sincere heart
 timeri ne uxor saltem iniurias patrum , iram populi adversus superbiam avaritiamque matris aperiat$$ No the fear was that as a wife at least she would divulge the wrongs of the Senate ,  and the wrath of the people at the arrogance and rapacity of his mother
 quod si nurum Agrippina non nisi filio infestam ferre posset , redderetur ipsa Othonis coniugio$$ If the only daughter-in-law Agrippina could bear was one who wished evil to her son ,  let her be restored to her union with Otho
 ituram quoque terrarum , ubi audiret potius contumelias imperatoris quam viseret periculis eius immixta$$ She would go anywhere in the world ,  where she might hear of the insults heaped on the emperor ,  rather than witness them ,  and be also involved in his perils
 haec atque talia lacrimis et arte adulterae penetrantia nemo prohibebat , cupientibus cunctis infringi potentiam matris et credente nullo usque ad caedem eius duratura filii odia$$ These and the like complaints ,  rendered impressive by tears and by the cunning of an adulteress ,  no one checked ,  as all longed to see the mother's power broken ,  while not a person believed that the son's hatred would steel his heart to her murder
 Tradit Cluvius ardore retinendae Agrippinam potentiae eo usque provectam , ut medio diei , cum id temporis Nero per vinum et epulas incalesceret , offerret se saepius temulento comptam in incesto paratam iamque lasciva oscula et praenuntias flagitii blanditias adnotantibus proximis , Senecam contra muliebris inlecebras subsidium a femina petivisse , immissamque Acten libertam , quae simul suo periculo et infamia Neronis anxia deferret pervulgatum esse incestum gloriante matre , nec toleraturos milites profani principis imperium$$ Cluvius relates that Agrippina in her eagerness to retain her influence went so far that more than once at midday ,  when Nero ,  even at that hour ,  was flushed with wine and feasting ,  she presented herself attractively attired to her half intoxicated son and offered him her person ,  and that when kinsfolk observed wanton kisses and caresses ,  portending infamy ,  it was Seneca who sought a female's aid against a woman's fascinations ,  and hurried in Acte ,  the freed-girl ,  who alarmed at her own peril and at Nero's disgrace ,  told him that the incest was notorious ,  as his mother boasted of it ,  and that the soldiers would never endure the rule of an impious sovereign
 Fabius Rusticus non Agrippinae sed Neroni cupitum id memorat eiusdemque libertae astu disiectum$$ Fabius Rusticus tells us that it was not Agrippina ,  but Nero ,  who lusted for the crime ,  and that it was frustrated by the adroitness of that same freed-girl
 sed quae Cluvius , eadem ceteri quoque auctores prodidere , et fama huc inclinat , seu concepit animo tantum immanitatis Agrippina , seu credibilior novae libidinis meditatio in ea visa est , quae puellaribus annis stuprum cum Marcus Lepido spe dominationis admiserat , pari cupidine usque ad libita Pallantis provoluta et exercita ad omne flagitium patrui nuptiis$$ Cluvius's account ,  however ,  is also that of all other authors ,  and popular belief inclines to it ,  whether it was that Agrippina really conceived such a monstrous wickedness in her heart ,  or perhaps because the thought of a strange passion seemed comparatively credible in a woman ,  who in her girlish years had allowed herself to be seduced by Lepidus in the hope of winning power ,  had stooped with a like ambition to the lust of Pallas ,  and had trained herself for every infamy by her marriage with her uncle
 Igitur Nero vitare secretos eius congressus , abscedentem in hortos aut Tusculanum vel Antiatem in agrum laudare , quod otium capesseret$$ Nero accordingly avoided secret interviews with her ,  and when she withdrew to her gardens or to her estates at Tusculum and Antium ,  he praised her for courting repose
 postremo , ubicumque haberetur , praegravem ratus interficere constituit , hactenus consultans , veneno an ferro vel qua alia vi$$ At last ,  convinced that she would be too formidable ,  wherever she might dwell ,  he resolved to destroy her ,  merely deliberating whether it was to be accomplished by poison ,  or by the sword ,  or by any other violent means
 placuitque primo venenum sed inter epulas principis si daretur , referri ad casum non poterat tali iam Britannici exitio$$ Poison at first seemed best ,  but ,  were it to be administered at the imperial table ,  the result could not be referred to chance after the recent circumstances of the death of Britannicus
 et ministros temptare arduum videbatur mulieris usu scelerum adversus insidias intentae atque ipsa praesumendo remedia munierat corpus$$ Again ,  to tamper with the servants of a woman who ,  from her familiarity with crime ,  was on her guard against treachery ,  appeared to be extremely difficult ,  and then ,  too ,  she had fortified her constitution by the use of antidotes
 ferrum et caedes quonam modo occultaretur , nemo reperiebat et ne quis illi tanto facinori delectus iussa sperneret metuebat$$ How again the dagger and its work were to be kept secret ,  no one could suggest ,  and it was feared too that whoever might be chosen to execute such a crime would spurn the order
 obtulit ingenium Anicetus libertus , classi apud Misenum praefectus et pueritiae Neronis educator ac mutuis odiis Agrippinae invisus$$ An ingenious suggestion was offered by Anicetus ,  a freedman ,  commander of the fleet at Misenum ,  who had been tutor to Nero in boyhood and had a hatred of Agrippina which she reciprocated
 ergo navem posse componi docet , cuius pars ipso in mari per artem soluta effunderet ignaram$$ He explained that a vessel could be constructed ,  from which a part might by a contrivance be detached ,  when out at sea ,  so as to plunge her unawares into the water
 nihil tam capax fortuitorum quam mare et si naufragio intercepta sit , quem adeo iniquum , ut sceleri adsignet , quod venti et fluctus deliquerint$$ Nothing ,  he said ,  allowed of accidents so much as the sea ,  and should she be overtaken by shipwreck ,  who would be so unfair as to impute to crime an offence committed by the winds and waves
 additurum principem defunctae templum et aras et cetera ostentandae pietati$$ The emperor would add the honour of a temple and of shrines to the deceased lady ,  with every other display of filial affection
 Noctem sideribus inlustrem et placido mari quietam quasi convincendum ad scelus dii praebuere$$ A night of brilliant starlight with the calm of a tranquil sea was granted by heaven ,  seemingly ,  to convict the crime
 nec multum erat progressa navis , duobus e numero familiarium Agrippinam comitantibus , ex quis Crepereius Gallus haud procul gubernaculis adstabat , Acerronia super pedes cubitantis reclinis paenitentiam filii et recuperatam matris gratiam per gaudium memorabat , cum dato signo ruere tectum loci multo plumbo grave , pressusque Crepereius et statim exanimatus est$$ The vessel had not gone far ,  Agrippina having with her two of her intimate attendants ,  one of whom ,  Crepereius Gallus ,  stood near the helm ,  while Acerronia ,  reclining at Agrippina's feet as she reposed herself ,  spoke joyfully of her son's repentance and of the recovery of the mother's influence ,  when at a given signal the ceiling of the place ,  which was loaded with a quantity of lead ,  fell in ,  and Crepereius was crushed and instantly killed
 Agrippina et Acerronia eminentibus lecti parietibus ac forte validioribus , quam ut oneri cederent , protectae sunt$$ Agrippina and Acerronia were protected by the projecting sides of the couch ,  which happened to be too strong to yield under the weight
 nec dissolutio navigii sequebatur , turbatis omnibus et quod plerique ignari etiam conscios impediebant$$ But this was not followed by the breaking up of the vessel
 visum dehinc remigibus unum in latus inclinare atque ita navem submergere$$ for all were bewildered ,  and those too ,  who were in the plot ,  were hindered by the unconscious majority
 sed neque ipsis promptus in rem subitam consensus , et alii contra nitentes dedere facultatem lenioris in mare iactus verum Acerronia , imprudentia dum se Agrippinam esse utque subveniretur matri principis clamitat , contis et remis et quae fors obtulerat navalibus telis conficitur Agrippina silens eoque minus agnita (unum tamen vulnus umero excepit) nando , deinde occursu lenunculorum Lucrinum in lacum vecta villae suae infertur$$ The crew then thought it best to throw the vessel on one side and so sink it ,  but they could not themselves promptly unite to face the emergency ,  and others ,  by counteracting the attempt ,  gave an opportunity of a gentler fall into the sea Acerronia ,  however ,  thoughtlessly exclaiming that she was Agrippina ,  and imploring help for the emperor's mother ,  was despatched with poles and oars ,  and such naval implements as chance offered Agrippina was silent and was thus the less recognized
 Illic reputans ideo se fallacibus litteris accitam et honore praecipuo habitam , quodque litus iuxta , non ventis acta , non saxis impulsa navis summa sui parte veluti terrestre machinamentum concidisset , observans etiam Acerroniae necem , simul suum vulnus adspiciens , solum insidiarum remedium esse sensit , si non intellegerentur$$ There she reflected how for this very purpose she had been invited by a lying letter and treated with conspicuous honour ,  how also it was near the shore ,  not from being driven by winds or dashed on rocks ,  that the vessel had in its upper part collapsed ,  like a mechanism anything but nautical She pondered too the death of Acerronia she looked at her own wound ,  and saw that her only safeguard against treachery was to ignore it
 misitque libertum Agermum , qui nuntiaret filio benignitate deum et fortuna eius evasisse gravem casum$$ Then she sent her freedman Agerinus to tell her son how by heaven's favour and his good fortune she had escaped a terrible disaster
 orare ut quamvis periculo matris exterritus visendi curam differret sibi ad praesens quiete opus$$ that she begged him ,  alarmed ,  as he might be ,  by his mother's peril ,  to put off the duty of a visit ,  as for the present she needed repose
 atque interim securitate simulata medicamina vulneri et fomenta corpori adhibet$$ Meanwhile ,  pretending that she felt secure ,  she applied remedies to her wound ,  and fomentations to her person
 testamentum Acerroniae requiri bonaque obsignari iubet , id tantum non per simulationem$$ She then ordered search to be made for the will of Acerronia ,  and her property to be sealed ,  in this alone throwing off disguise
 Interim vulgato Agrippinae periculo , quasi casu evenisset , ut quisque acceperat , decurrere ad litus$$ Meantime ,  Agrippina's peril being universally known and taken to be an accidental occurrence ,  everybody ,  the moment he heard of it ,  hurried down to the beach
 hi molium obiectus , hi proximas scaphas scandere$$ Some climbed projecting piers
 alii , quantum corpus sinebat , vadere in mare$$ some the nearest vessels
 quidam manus protendere$$ others ,  as far as their stature allowed ,  went into the sea
 questibus votis clamore diversa rogitantium aut incerta respondentium omnis ora compleri$$ some ,  again ,  stood with outstretched arms ,  while the whole shore rung with wailings ,  with prayers and cries ,  as different questions were asked and uncertain answers given
 adfluere ingens multitudo cum luminibus , atque ubi incolumem esse pernotuit , ut ad gratandum sese expedire , donec adspectu armati et minitantis agminis deiecti sunt$$ A vast multitude streamed to the spot with torches ,  and as soon as all knew that she was safe ,  they at once prepared to wish her joy ,  till the sight of an armed and threatening force scared them away
 Anicetus villam statione circumdat refractaque ianua obvios servorum abripit , donec ad fores cubiculi veniret$$ Anicetus then surrounded the house with a guard ,  and having burst open the gates ,  dragged off the slaves who met him ,  till he came to the door of her chamber ,  where a few still stood ,  after the rest had fled in terror at the attack
 cui pauci adstabant , ceteris terrore inrumpentium exterritis cubiculo modicum lumen inerat et ancillarum una , magis ac magis anxia Agrippina , quod nemo a filio ac ne Agermus quidem$$ A small lamp was in the room ,  and one slave-girl with Agrippina ,  who grew more and more anxious ,  as no messenger came from her son ,  not even Agerinus ,  while the appearance of the shore was changed ,  a solitude one moment ,  then sudden bustle and tokens of the worst catastrophe
 aliam fore laetae rei faciem$$ As the girl rose to depart ,  she exclaimed ,  Do you too forsake me
 nunc solitudinem ac repentinos strepitus et extremi mali indicia$$ and looking round saw Anicetus ,  who had with him the captain of the trireme ,  Herculeius ,  and Obaritus ,  a centurion of marines
 abeunte dehinc ancilla , tu quoque me deseris$$ If ,  said she ,  you have come to see me ,  take back word that I have recovered ,  but if you are here to do a crime ,  I believe nothing about my son

 oratorum ac vatum victorias incitamentum ingeniis adlaturas nec cuiquam iudici grave aures studiis honestis et voluptatibus concessis impertire$$ The victories won by orators and poets would furnish a stimulus to genius ,  and it could not be a burden for any judge to bestow his attention on graceful pursuits or on legitimate recreations
 laetitiae magis quam lasciviae dari paucas totius quinquennii noctes , quibus tanta luce ignium nihil inlicitum occultari queat$$ It was to mirth rather than to profligacy that a few nights every five years were devoted ,  and in these amid such a blaze of illumination no lawless conduct could be concealed

 quippe in coloniam Camulodunum recens deducti pellebant domibus , exturbabant agris , captivos , servos appellando , foventibus impotentiam veteranorum militibus similitudine vitae et spe eiusdem licentiae$$ It was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense For these new settlers in the colony of Camulodunum drove people out of their houses ,  ejected them from their farms ,  called them captives and slaves ,  and the lawlessness of the veterans was encouraged by the soldiers ,  who lived a similar life and hoped for similar licence

 Boudicca curru filias prae se vehens , ut quamque nationem accesserat , solitum quidem Britannis feminarum ductu bellare testabatur , sed tunc non ut tantis maioribus ortam regnum et opes , verum ut unam e vulgo libertatem amissam , confectum verberibus corpus , contrectatam filiarum pudicitiam ulcisci$$ Boudicea ,  with her daughters before her in a chariot ,  went up to tribe after tribe ,  protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women But now ,  she said ,  it is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry ,  but as one of the people that I am avenging lost freedom ,  my scourged body ,  the outraged chastity of my daughters

 sed nihil aeque quam fames adfligebat serendis frugibus incuriosos , et omni aetate ad bellum versa , dum nostros commeatus sibi destinant$$ Nothing however distressed the enemy so much as famine ,  for they had been careless about sowing corn ,  people of every age having gone to the war ,  while they reckoned on our supplies as their own
 gentesque praeferoces tardius ad pacem inclinabant , quia Iulius Classicianus , successor Cato missus et Suetonio discors , bonum publicum privatis simultatibus impediebat disperseratque novum legatum opperiendum esse , sine hostili ira et superbia victoris clementer deditis consulturum$$ Nations ,  too ,  so high-spirited inclined the more slowly to peace ,  because Julius Classicanus ,  who had been sent as successor to Catus and was at variance with Suetonius ,  let private animosities interfere with the public interest ,  and had spread an idea that they ought to wait for a new governor who ,  having neither the anger of an enemy nor the pride of a conqueror ,  would deal mercifully with those who had surrendered
 simul in urbem mandabat , nullum proeliorum finem exspectarent , nisi succederetur Suetonio , cuius adversa pravitati ipsius , prospera ad fortunam referebat$$ At the same time he stated in a despatch to Rome that no cessation of fighting must be expected ,  unless Suetonius were superseded ,  attributing that general's disasters to perverseness and his successes to good luck

 sed hostibus inrisui fuit , apud quos flagrante etiam tum libertate nondum cognita libertinorum potentia erat mirabanturque , quod dux et exercitus tanti belli confector servitiis oboedirent$$ But to the enemy he was a laughing-stock ,  for they still retained some of the fire of liberty ,  knowing nothing yet of the power of freedmen ,  and so they marvelled to see a general and an army who had finished such a war cringing to slaves
 cuncta tamen id imperatorem in mollius relata$$ Everything ,  however ,  was softened down for the emperor's ears ,  and Suetonius was retained in the government
 detentusque rebus gerundis Suetonius , quod paucas naves in litore remigiumque in iis amiserat , tamquam durante bello tradere exercitu Pertronio Turpiliano , qui iam consulatu abierat , iubetur$$ but as he subsequently lost a few vessels on the shore with the crews ,  he was ordered ,  as though the war continued ,  to hand over his army to Petronius Turpilianus ,  who had just resigned his consulship

 illi Antonium Primum et Asinium Marcellum sociaverant$$ These men had associated with them Antonius Primus and Asinius Marcellus
 Antonius audacia promptus , Marcellus Asinio Pollione proavo clarus neque morum spernendus habebatur , nisi quod paupertatem praecipuum malorum credebat$$ Antonius was a man of ready audacity Marcellus had the glory of being the great-grandson of Asinius Pollio ,  and bore a character far from contemptible ,  except that he thought poverty the greatest of all evils
 igitur Fabianus tabulas adhibitis iis quos memoravi et aliis minus inlustribus obsignat$$ So Fabianus ,  with the persons whom I have named and some others less distinguished ,  executed the will

 additur senatus consulto , qui talem operam emptitasset vendidissetve , perinde poena teneretur ac publico iudicio calumniae condemnatus$$ A clause was added to the Senate's decree ,  that whoever bought or sold such a service was to be just as liable to punishment as if he had been publicly convicted of false accusation

 ceterum cum vetere ex more familiam omnem , quae sub eodem tecto mansitaverat , ad supplicium agi oporteret , concursu plebis , quae tot innoxios protegebat , usque ad seditionem ventum est senatusque obsessus , in quo ipso erant studia nimiam severitatem aspernantium , pluribus nihil mutandum censentibus$$ Ancient custom required that the whole slave-establishment which had dwelt under the same roof should be dragged to execution ,  when a sudden gathering of the populace ,  which was for saving so many innocent lives ,  brought matters to actual insurrection Even in the Senate there was a strong feeling on the part of those who shrank from extreme rigour ,  though the majority were opposed to any innovation
 ex quis Gaius Cassius sententiae loco in hunc modum disseruit$$ Of these ,  Caius Cassius ,  in giving his vote ,  argued to the following effect

 simul quicquid hoc in nobis auctoritatis est , crebris contradictionibus destruendum non existimabam , ut maneret integrum , si quando res publica consiliis eguisset$$ At the same time I thought that any influence I possess ought not to be destroyed by incessant protests ,  wishing that it might remain unimpaired ,  should the State ever need my counsels
 quod hodie venit , consulari viro domi suae interfecto per insidias serviles , quas nemo prohibuit aut prodidit quamvis nondum concusso senatus consulto , quod supplicium toti familiae minitabatur$$ To-day this has come to pass ,  since an ex-consul has been murdered in his house by the treachery of slaves ,  which not one hindered or divulged ,  though the Senate's decree ,  which threatens the entire slave-establishment with execution ,  has been till now unshaken

 mox licentia habendi oblivionem attulit$$ Soon full freedom for their possession caused their oblivion
 Sed gravescentibus in dies publicis malis subsidia minuebantur , concessitque vita Burrus , incertum valetudine an veneno$$ But while the miseries of the State were daily growing worse ,  its supports were becoming weaker
 valetudo ex eo coniectabatur , quod in se tumescentibus paulatim faucibus et impedito meatu spiritum finiebat$$ Burrus died ,  whether from illness or from poison was a question It was supposed to be illness from the fact that from the gradual swelling of his throat inwardly and the closing up of the passage he ceased to breathe
 plures iussu Neronis , quasi remedium adhiberetur , inlitum palatum eius noxio medicamine adseverabant , et Burrum intellecto scelere , cum ad visendum eum princeps venisset , adspectum eius aversatum sciscitanti hactenus respondisse$$ Many positively asserted that by Nero's order his throat was smeared with some poisonous drug under the pretence of the application of a remedy ,  and that Burrus ,  who saw through the crime ,  when the emperor paid him a visit ,  recoiled with horror from his gaze ,  and merely replied to his question ,  I indeed am well
 ego me bene habeo civitati grande desiderium eius mansit per memoriam virtutis et successorum alterius segnem innocentiam , alterius flagrantissima flagitia adulteria$$ Rome felt for him a deep and lasting regret ,  because of the remembrance of his worth ,  because too of the merely passive virtue of one of his successors and the very flagrant iniquities of the other
 quippe Caesar duos praetoriis cohortibus imposuerat , Faenium Rufum ex vulgi favore , quia rem frumentariam sine quaestu tractabat , Ofonium Tigellinum , veterem impudicitiam atque infamiam in eo secutus$$ For the emperor had appointed two men to the command of the praetorian cohorts ,  Faenius Rufus ,  for a vulgar popularity ,  which he owed to his administration of the corn-supplies without profit to himself and Sofonius Tigellinus ,  whose inveterate shamelessness and infamy were an attraction to him
 atque illi pro cognitis moribus fuere , validior Tigellinus in animo principis et intimis libidinibus adsumptus , prospera populi et militum fama Rufus , quod apud Neronem adversum experiebatur$$ As might have been expected from their known characters ,  Tigellinus had the greater influence with the prince ,  and was the associate of his most secret profligacy ,  while Rufus enjoyed the favour of the people and of the soldiers ,  and this ,  he found ,  prejudiced him with Nero
 At Seneca criminantium non ignarus , prodentibus iis , quibus aliqua honesti cura , et familiaritatem eius magis aspernante Caesare , tempus sermoni orat et accepto ita incipit$$ Seneca ,  meanwhile ,  aware of these slanders ,  which were revealed to him by those who had some respect for merit ,  coupled with the fact that the emperor more and more shunned his intimacy ,  besought the opportunity of an interview
 quartus decimus annus est , Caesar , ex quo spei tuae admotus sum , octavus , ut imperium obtines$$ This was granted ,  and he spoke as follows 
 medio temporis tantum honorum atque opum in me cumulasti , ut nihil felicitati meae desit nisi moderatio eius , utar magnis exemplis , nec meae fortunae , sed tuae$$ It is fourteen years ago ,  Caesar ,  that I was first associated with your prospects ,  and eight years since you have been emperor In the interval ,  you have heaped on me such honours and riches that nothing is wanting to my happiness but a right use of it
 abavus tuus Augustus Marco Agrippae Mytilenese secretum , Gaius Maecenati urbe in ipsa velut peregrinum otium permisit$$ I will refer to great examples taken not from my own but from your position
 quorum alter bellorum socius , alter Romae pluribus laboribus iactatus ampla quidem sed pro ingentibus meritis , praemia acceperant$$ Your great-grandfather Augustus granted to Marcus Agrippa the calm repose of Mitylene ,  to Caius Maecenas what was nearly equivalent to a foreign retreat in the capital itself
 ego quid aliud munificentiae tuae adhibere potui quam studia , ut sic dixerim , in umbra educata , et quibus claritudo venit , quod iuventae tuae rudimentis adfuisse videor , grande huius rei pretium at tu gratiam immensam innumeram pecuniam circumdedisti , adeo ut plerumque intra me ipse volvam$$ One of these men shared his wars the other struggled with many laborious duties at Rome both received awards which were indeed splendid ,  but only proportioned to their great merits For myself ,  what other recompense had I for your munificence ,  than a culture nursed ,  so to speak ,  in the shade of retirement ,  and to which a glory attaches itself ,  because I thus seem to have helped on the early training of your youth ,  an ample reward for the service
 egone , equestri et provinciali loco ortus , proceribus civitatis adnumeror inter nobiles et longa decora praeferentes novitas mea enituit$$ You on the other hand have surrounded me with vast influence and boundless wealth ,  so that I often think within myself ,  Am I ,  who am but of an equestrian and provincial family ,  numbered among the chief men of Rome

 tales hortos exstruit et per haec suburbana incedit et tantis agrorum spatiis , tam lato faenore exuberat$$ Where is the mind once content with a humble lot Is this the man who is building up his garden terraces ,  who paces grandly through these suburban parks ,  and revels in the affluence of such broad lands and such widely-spread investments
 una defensio occurrit , quod muneribus tuis obniti non debui$$ Only one apology occurs to me ,  that it would not have been right in me to have thwarted your bounty
 Ad quae Nero sic ferme respondit$$ Nero's reply was substantially this 
 quod meditatae orationi tuae statim occurram , id primum tui muneris habeo , qui me non tantum praevisa , sed subita expedire docuisti$$ My being able to meet your elaborate speech with an instant rejoinder is ,  I consider ,  primarily your gift ,  for you taught me how to express myself not only after reflection but at a moment's notice
 abavus meus Augustus Agrippae et Maecenati usurpare otium post labores concessit , sed in ea ipse aetate , cuius auctoritas tueretur quicquid illud et qualecumque tribuisset$$ My great-grandfather Augustus allowed Agrippa and Maecenas to enjoy rest after their labours ,  but he did it at an age carrying with it an authority sufficient to justify any boon ,  of any sort ,  he might have bestowed
 ac tamen neutrum datis a se praemiis exuit bello et periculis meruerant$$ But neither of them did he strip of the rewards he had given
 in iis enim iuventa Augusti versata est$$ It was by war and its perils they had earned them
 nec mihi tela et manus tuae defuissent in armis agenti$$ for in these the youth of Augustus was spent
 sed quod praesens condicio poscebat , ratione consilio praeceptis pueritiam , dein iuventam meam fovisti$$ And if I had passed my years in arms ,  your sword and right hand would not have failed me

 unde etiam rubori mihi est , quod praecipuus caritate nondum omnes fortuna antecellis$$ I am ashamed to quote the names of freedmen who parade a greater wealth
 Verum et tibi valida aetas rebusque et fructui rerum sufficiens , et nos prima imperii spatia ingredimur , nisi forte aut te Vitellio ter consuli aut me Claudio postponis , et quantum Volusio longa parsimonia quaesivit , tantum in te mea liberalitas explere non potest$$ Yours too is a still vigorous manhood ,  quite equal to the labours of business and to the fruit of those labours and ,  as for myself ,  I am but treading the threshold of empire But perhaps you count yourself inferior to Vitellius ,  thrice a consul ,  and me to Claudius Such wealth as long thrift has procured for Volusius ,  my bounty ,  you think ,  cannot fully make up to you
 quin , si qua in parte lubricum adulescentiae nostrae declinat , revocas ornatumque robur subsidio impensius regis$$ Why not rather ,  if the frailty of my youth goes in any respect astray ,  call me back and guide yet more zealously with your help the manhood which you have instructed
 non tua moderatio si reddideris pecuniam , nec quies , si reliqueris principem , sed mea avaritia , meae crudelitatis metus in ore omnium versabitur$$ It will not be your moderation ,  if you restore me your wealth ,  not your love of quiet ,  if you forsake your emperor ,  but my avarice ,  the fear of my cruelty ,  which will be in all men's mouths
 quod si maxime continentia tua laudetur , non tamen sapienti viro decorum fuerit , unde amico infamiam paret , inde gloriam sibi recipere$$ Even if your self-control were praised to the utmost ,  still it would not be seemly in a wise man to get glory for himself in the very act of bringing disgrace on his friend
 his adicit complexum et oscula , factus natura et consuetudine exercitus velare odium fallacibus blanditiis$$ To these words the emperor added embraces and kisses for he was formed by nature and trained by habit to veil his hatred under delusive flattery
 Seneca , qui finis omnium cum dominante sermonum , grates agit$$ Seneca thanked him ,  the usual end of an interview with a despot
 sed instituta prioris potentiae commutat , prohibet coetus salutantium , vitat comitantes , rarus per urbem , quasi valetudine infensa aut sapientiae studiis domi attineretur$$ But he entirely altered the practices of his former greatness he kept the crowds of his visitors at a distance ,  avoided trains of followers ,  seldom appeared in Rome ,  as though weak health or philosophical studies detained him at home
 Perculso Seneca promptum fuit Rufum Faenium imminuere Agrippinae amicitiam in eo criminantibus$$ When Seneca had fallen ,  it was easy to shake the position of Faenius Rufus by making Agrippina's friendship a charge against him
 validiorque in dies Tigellinus et malas artes , quibus solis pollebat , gratiores ratus , si principem societate scelerum obstringeret , metus eius rimatur compertoque Plautum et Sullam maxime timeri , Plautum in Asiam , Sullam in Galliam Narbonensem nuper amotos , nobilitatem eorum et propinquos huic Orientis , illi Germaniae exercitus commemorat$$ Tigellinus ,  who was daily becoming more powerful and who thought that the wicked schemings which alone gave him strength ,  would be better liked if he could secure the emperor's complicity in guilt ,  dived into Nero's most secret apprehensions ,  and ,  as soon as he had ascertained that Plautus and Sulla were the men he most dreaded ,  Plautus having been lately sent away to Asia ,  Sulla to Gallia Narbonensis ,  he spoke much of their noble rank and of their respective proximity to the armies of the East and of Germany
 non se , ut Burrum , diversas spes , sed solam incolumitatem Neronis spectare$$ I have no eye ,  he said ,  like Burrus ,  to two conflicting aims ,  but only to Nero's safety ,  which is at least secured against treachery in Rome by my presence
 cui caveri utcumque ab urbanis insidiis praesenti opera$$ As for distant commotions ,  how can they be checked
 longinquos motus quonam modo comprimi posse erectas Gallias ad nomen dictatorium , nec minus suspensos Asiae populos claritudine avi Drusi$$ Gaul is roused at the name of the great dictator ,  and I distrust no less the nations of Asia ,  because of the renown of such a grandfather as Drusus
 Sullam inopem , unde praecipuam audaciam , et simulatione segnitiae , dum temeritati locum reperiret$$ Sulla is poor ,  and hence comes his surpassing audacity he shams apathy ,  while he is seeking an opening for his reckless ambition
 Plautum magnis opibus ne fingere quidem cupidinem otii , sed veterum Romanorum imitamenta praeferre , adsumpta etiam Stoicorum adrogantia sectaque , quae turbidos et negotiorum adpetentes faciat$$ Plautus again ,  with his great wealth ,  does not so much as affect a love of repose ,  but he flaunts before us his imitations of the old Romans ,  and assumes the self-consciousness of the Stoics along with a philosophy ,  which makes men restless ,  and eager for a busy life
 nec ultra mora$$ There was not a moment's delay
 Sulla sexto die pervectis Massiliam percussoribus ante metum et rumorem interficitur , cum epulandi causa discumberet$$ Sulla ,  six days afterwards ,  was murdered by assassins brought over to Massilia ,  while he was reclining at the dinner-table ,  before he feared or heard of his danger
 relatum caput eius inlusit Nero tamquam praematura canitie deforme$$ The head was taken to Rome ,  and Nero scoffed at its premature grey hairs as if they were a disfigurement
 Plauto parari necem non perinde occultum fuit , quia pluribus salus eius curabatur , et spatium itineris ac maris tempusque interiectum moverat famam vulgoque fingebant petitum ab eo Corbulonem , magnis tum exercitibus praesidentem et , clari atque insontes si interficerentur , praecipuum ad pericula$$ It was less of a secret that there was a design to murder Plautus ,  as his life was dear to many The distance too by land and sea ,  and the interval of time ,  had given rise to rumours ,  and the popular story was that he had tampered with Corbulo ,  who was then at the head of great armies ,  and would be a special mark for danger ,  if illustrious and innocent men were to be destroyed
 quin et Asiam favore iuvenis arma cepisse , nec milites ad scelus missos aut numero validos aut animo promptos , postquam iussa efficere nequiverint , ad spes novas transisse$$ Again Asia ,  it was said ,  from its partiality for the young man ,  had taken up arms ,  and the soldiers sent to do the crime ,  not being sufficient in number or decided in purpose ,  and ,  finding themselves unable to execute their orders ,  had gone over to the new cause

 nullum interim subsidium aspernandum$$ Meantime no resource was to be rejected
 si sexaginta milites (tot enim adveniebant) propulisset , dum refertur nuntius Neroni , dum manus alia permeat , multa secutura , quae adusque bellum evalescerent$$ If he did but repel sixty soldiers (this was the number on the way) ,  while tidings were being carried back to Nero ,  while another force was on its march ,  many events would follow which would ripen into war
 denique aut salutem tali consilio quaeri , aut nihil gravius audenti quam ignavo patiendum esse$$ Finally ,  by this plan he either secured safety ,  or he would suffer nothing worse by daring than by cowardice
 Sed Plautum ea non movere , sive nullam opem providebat inermis et exul , seu taedio ambiguae spei , an amore coniugis et liberorum , quibus placabiliorem fore principem rebatur nulla sollicitudine turbatum$$ But all this had no effect on Plautus Either he saw no resource before him ,  an unarmed exile as he was ,  or he was weary of an uncertain hope ,  or was swayed by his love of his wife and of his children ,  to whom he thought the emperor ,  if harassed by no anxiety ,  would be more merciful
 sunt qui alios a socero nuntios venisse ferant , tamquam nihil atrox immineret doctoresque sapientiae , Coeranum Graeci , Musonium Tusci generis , constantiam opperiendae mortis pro incerta et trepida vita suassisse$$ Some say that another message came to him from his father-in-law ,  representing that no dreadful peril hung over him ,  and that two teachers of philosophy ,  Coeranus from Greece and Musonius from Etruria ,  advised him to await death with firmness rather than lead a precarious and anxious life
 repertus est certe per medium diei nudus exercitando corpori$$ At all events ,  he was surprised at midday ,  when stripped for exercise

 cuius adspectu (ipsa principis verba referam) cur , inquit , Nero * * * et posito metu nuptias Poppaeae ob eius modi terrores dilatas maturare parat Octaviamque coniugem amoliri , quamvis modeste ageret , nomine patris et studiis populi gravem$$ At its sight the emperor exclaimed (I give his very words) ,  Why would you have been a Nero Then casting off all fear he prepared to hurry on his marriage with Poppaea ,  hitherto deferred because of such alarms as I have described ,  and to divorce his wife Octavia ,  notwithstanding her virtuous life ,  because her father's name and the people's affection for her made her an offence to him
 sed ad senatum litteras misit de caede Sullae Plautique haud confessus , verum utriusque turbidum ingenium esse , et sibi incolumitatem rei publicae magna cura haberi$$ He wrote ,  however ,  a letter to the Senate ,  confessing nothing about the murders of Sulla and Plautus ,  but merely hinting that both had a restless temper ,  and that he gave the most anxious thought to the safety of the State
 decretae eo nomine supplicationes , utque Sulla et Plautus senatu moverentur , gravioribus iam ludibriis quam malis$$ On this pretext a thanksgiving was decreed ,  and also the expulsion from the Senate of Sulla and Plautus ,  more grievous ,  however ,  as a farce than as an actual calamity

 non alia exul visentium oculos maiore misericordia adfecit$$ Then he confined her in the island of Pandataria
 meminerant adhuc quidam Agrippinae a Tiberio , recentior Iuliae memoria obversabatur a Claudio pulsae sed illis robur aetatis adfuerat$$ No exile ever filled the eyes of beholders with tears of greater compassion Some still remembered Agrippina ,  banished by Tiberius ,  and the yet fresher memory of Julia ,  whom Claudius exiled ,  was present to men's thoughts

 huic primum nuptiarum dies loco funeris fuit , deductae in domum , in qua nihil nisi luctuosum haberet , erepto per venenum patre et statim fratre$$ For Octavia ,  from the first ,  her marriage-day was a kind of funeral ,  brought ,  as she was ,  into a house where she had nothing but scenes of mourning ,  her father and ,  an instant afterwards ,  her brother ,  having been snatched from her by poison

 prohibent Romani et pacem numquam ipsis prospere lacessitam nunc quoque in exitium suum abrumpunt$$ The Romans thwart me ,  and though they have never with success to themselves disturbed the peace between us ,  they are now again breaking it to their own destruction
 non ibo infitias$$ I will not attempt to deny one thing

 vestra quidem vis et gloria in integro est , addita modestiae fama , quae neque summis mortalium spernenda est et a dis aestimatur$$ Assuredly your strength and renown are at their height ,  and you have in addition the repute of obedience ,  which the greatest of mortals must not despise ,  and which the gods highly esteem
 simul diademate caput Tiridatis evinxit , promptam equitum manum , quae regem ex more sectatur , Monaesi nobili viro tradidit , adiectis Adiabenorum auxiliis , mandavitque Tigranen Armenia exturbare , dum ipse positis adversus Hyrcanos discordiis vires intimas molemque belli ciet , provinciis Romanis minitans$$ As he spoke ,  he encircled Tiridates' brow with a diadem ,  and to Moneses ,  a noble ,  he entrusted a highly efficient body of cavalry ,  which was the king's customary escort ,  giving him also some auxiliaries from the Adiabeni ,  and orders that Tigranes was to be driven out of Armenia He would himself abandon his feud with the Hyrcanians ,  and raise his own national force in all its warlike strength by way of menace to the Roman provinces
 Quae ubi Corbuloni certis nuntiis audita sunt , legiones duas cum Verulano Severo et Vettio Bolano subsidium Tigrani mittit , occulto praecepto , compositius cuncta quam festinantius agerent quippe bellum habere quam gerere malebat , scripseratque Caesari proprio duce opus esse , qui Armeniam defenderet Syriam ingruente Vologaese acriore in discrimine esse$$ When Corbulo had heard all this from messengers he could trust ,  he sent two legions under Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the support of Tigranes ,  with secret instructions that they were to conduct all their operations with deliberation rather than despatch ,  as he would prefer to sustain rather than to make war And indeed he had written to the emperor that a general was wanted specially for the defence of Armenia ,  and that Syria ,  threatened as it was by Vologeses ,  was in yet more imminent peril
 atque interim reliquas legiones pro ripa Euphratis locat , tumultuariam provincialium manum armat , hostiles ingressus praesidiis intercipit$$ Meanwhile he posted his remaining legions on the bank of the Euphrates ,  armed a hastily collected force of provincials ,  and occupied with troops the enemy's approaches

 occupaverat Tigranocertam , urbem copia defensorum et magnitudine moenium validam$$ He had ,  in fact ,  occupied Tigranocerta ,  a city strong from the multitude of its defenders and the vastness of its fortifications
 ad hoc Nicephorius amnis haud spernenda latitudine partem murorum ambit , et ducta ingens fossa , qua fluvio diffidebatur$$ In addition ,  the river Nicephorius ,  the breadth of which is far from contemptible ,  circled a portion of its walls ,  and a wide fosse was drawn where they distrusted the protection of the stream
 inerantque milites et provisi ante commeatus , quorum subvectu pauci avidius progressi et repentinis hostibus circumventi ira magis quam metu ceteros accenderant$$ There were some soldiers too ,  and supplies previously provided In the conveyance of these a few men had hurried on too eagerly ,  and ,  having been surprised by a sudden attack from the enemy ,  had inspired their comrades with rage rather than fear
 sed Partho ad exsequendas obsidiones nulla comminus audacia$$ But the Parthian has not the daring in close combat needed for a successful siege

 Corbulo tamen , quamvis secundis rebus suis , moderandum fortunae ratus misit ad Vologaesen , qui expostularent vim provinciae inlatam socium amicumque regem , cohortes Romanas circumsederi$$ Corbulo ,  however ,  notwithstanding his successes thought he must use his good fortune with moderation ,  and sent Vologeses a message of remonstrance against the violence done to a Roman province ,  and the blockade of an allied and friendly king and of Roman cohorts
 omitteret potius obsidionem , aut se quoque in agro hostili castra positurum$$ He had better give up the siege ,  or he ,  Corbulo too would encamp in his territory ,  as on hostile ground
 Casperius centurio in eam legationem delectus apud oppidum Nisibin , septem et triginta milibus passuum a Tigranocerta distantem , adit regem et mandata ferociter edidit$$ Casperius ,  a centurion selected for this mission ,  had an interview with the king at the town Nisibis ,  thirty-seven miles distant from Tigranocerta ,  and with fearless spirit announced his message
 Vologaesi vetus et penitus infixum erat arma romana vitandi , nec praesentia prospere fluebant$$ With Vologeses it was an old and deep conviction that he should shun the arms of Rome
 inritum obsidium , tutus manu et copiis Tigranes , fugati qui expugnationem sumpserant , missae in Armeniam legiones , et alia pro Syria paratae ultro inrumpere$$ Nor was the present going smoothly with him The seige was a failure Tigranes was safe with his troops and supplies those who had undertaken the storming of the place had been routed
 sibi imbecillum equitem pabuli inopia nam exorta vi locustarum aberat quicquid herbidum aut frondosum$$ legions had been sent into Armenia ,  and other legions were ready to rush to the attack on behalf of Syria ,  while his own cavalry was crippled by want of food
 igitur metu abstruso mitiora obtendens , missurum ad imperatorem Romanum legatos super petenda Armenia et firmanda pace respondet Monaesen omittere Tigranocertam iubet , ipse retro concedit$$ A host of locusts ,  suddenly appearing ,  had devoured every blade of grass and every leaf And so ,  hiding his fear and presenting a more conciliatory attitude ,  he replied that he would send envoys to the Roman emperor for the possession of Armenia and the conclusion of a lasting peace
 Interim Corbulo numquam neglectam Euphratis ripam crebrioribus praesidiis insedit$$ Meanwhile Corbulo occupied the bank of the Euphrates ,  which he had never neglected ,  with troops at closer intervals
 et ne ponti iniciendo impedimentum hostiles turmae adferrent (iam enim subiectis magna specie volitabant) , naves magnitudine praestantes et conexas trabibus ac turribus auctas agit per amnem catapultisque et balistis proturbat barbaros , in quos saxa et hastae longius permeabant , quam ut contrario sagittarum iactu adaequarentur$$ That he might have no hindrance in throwing a bridge over it from the enemy's cavalry ,  which was already scouring the adjoining plains with a formidable display ,  he launched on the river some vessels of remarkable size ,  linked together by beams ,  with towers rising from their decks ,  and with catapults and balistas he drove off the barbarians
 dein pons continuatus collesque adversi per socias cohortes , post legionum castris occupantur , tanta celeritate et ostentatione virium , ut Parthi omisso paratu invadendae Syriae spem omnem in Armeniam verterent , ubi Paetus imminentium nescius quintam legionem procul in Ponto habebat , reliquas promiscis militum commeatibus infirmaverat , donec adventare Vologaesen magno et infenso agmine auditum$$ The stones and spears penetrated their host at a range beyond the reach of the opposing volleys of arrows The bridge was then completed ,  and the hills facing us were occupied by our auxiliary infantry ,  then ,  by the entrenchments of the legions ,  with such rapidity and such a display of force that the Parthians ,  giving up their preparations for the invasion of Syria ,  concentrated all their hopes on Armenia
 Accitur legio duodecima , et unde famam aucti exercitus speraverat , prodita infrequentia$$ Paetus ,  ignorant of the impending danger ,  was keeping the 5th legion at a distance in Pontus
 qua tamen retineri castra et eludi Parthus tractu belli poterat , si Paeto aut in suis aut in alienis consiliis constantia fuisset$$ the rest he had weakened by indiscriminate furloughs ,  till it was heard that Vologeses was approaching with a powerful force bent on war
 verum ubi a viris militaribus adversus urgentes casus firmatus erat , rursus , ne alienae sententiae indigens videretur , in diversa ac deteriora transibat$$ He summoned the 12th legion ,  and then was discovered the numerical feebleness of the source from which he had hoped for the repute of an augmented army
 et tunc relictis hibernis non fossam neque vallum sibi , sed corpora et arma in hostem data clamitans , duxit legiones quasi proelio certaturus$$ Yet even thus the camp might have been held ,  and the Parthian foe baffled ,  by protracting the war ,  had Paetus stood firm either by his own counsels or by those of others
 deinde amisso centurione et paucis militibus , quos visendis hostium copiis praemiserat , trepidus remeavit$$ But though military men had put him on his guard against imminent disasters ,  still ,  not wishing to seem to need the advice of others ,  he would fall back on some quite different and inferior plan
 et quia minus acriter Vologaeses institerat , vana rursus fiducia tria milia delicti peditis proximo Tauri iugo imposuit , quo transitum regis arcerent$$ So now ,  leaving his winter quarters ,  and exclaiming that not the fosse or the rampart ,  but the men's bodies and weapons were given him for facing the foe ,  he led out his legions ,  as if he meant to fight a battle
 alares quoque Pannonios , robur equitatus , in parte campi locat$$ Then ,  after losing a centurion and a few soldiers whom he had sent on in advance to reconnoitre the enemy's forces ,  he returned in alarm
 coniux ac filius castello , cui Arsamosata nomen est , abditi , data in praesidium cohorte ac disperso milite , qui in uno habitus vagum hostem promptius sustentavisset aegre compulsum ferunt , ut instantem Corbuloni fateretur$$ And ,  as Vologeses had not pressed his advantage with much vigour ,  Paetus once again ,  with vain confidence ,  posted 3000 chosen infantry on the adjacent ridge of the taurus ,  in order to bar the king's passage He also stationed some Pannonian troopers ,  the flower of his cavalry ,  in a part of the plain
 nec a Corbulone properatum , quo gliscentibus periculis etiam subsidii laus augeretur$$ His wife and son he removed to a fortress named Arsamosata ,  with a cohort for their defence ,  thus dispersing the troops which ,  if kept together ,  could easily have checked the desultory skirmishing of the enemy
 expediri tamen itineri singula milia ex tribus legionibus et alarios octingentos , parem numerum e cohortibus iussit$$ He could ,  it is said ,  scarcely be driven to confess to Corbulo how the enemy was pressing him
 At Vologaeses , quamvis obsessa a Paeto itinera hinc peditatu inde equite accepisset , nihil mutato consilio , sed vi ac minis alares exterruit , legionarios obtrivit , uno tantum centurione Tarquitio Crescente turrim , in qua praesidium agitabat , defendere auso factaque saepius eruptione et caesis , qui barbarorum propius suggrediebantur , donec ignium iactu circumveniretur$$ Vologeses meanwhile ,  though he had heard that the roads were blocked by Paetus ,  here with infantry ,  there with cavalry ,  did not alter his plan ,  but drove off the latter by the menace of an attack ,  and crushed the legionaires ,  only one centurion of whom ,  Tarquitius Crescens ,  dared to defend a tower in which he was keeping guard He had often sallied out ,  and cut to pieces such of the barbarians as came close up to the walls ,  till he was overwhelmed with volleys of firebrands
 peditum si quis integer , longinqua et avia , vulnerati castra repetivere , virtutem regis , saevitiam et copias gentium , cuncta metu extollentes , facili credulitate eorum , qui eadem pavebant$$ Every foot soldier still unwounded fled to remote wilds ,  and those who were disabled ,  returned to the camp ,  exaggerating in their terror the king's valour ,  and the warlike strength of his tribes ,  everything in short ,  to the simple credulity of those who trembled with like fear
 ne dux quidem obniti adversis , sed cuncta militiae munia deseruerat , missis iterum ad Corbulonem precibus , veniret propere , signa et aquilas et nomen reliquum infelicis exercitus tueretur$$ Even the general did not struggle against his reverses He had indeed wholly abandoned all the duties of a soldier ,  and had again sent an entreaty to Corbulo ,  that he would come with speed to save the standards and eagles ,  and the name yet left to the unfortunate army
 se fidem interim , donec vita suppeditet , retenturos$$ they meantime ,  he said ,  would hold to their fidelity while life lasted
 Ille interritus et parte copiarum apud Syriam relicta , ut munimenta Euphrati imposita retinerentur , qua proximum et commeatibus non egenum , regionem Commagenam , exim Cappadociam , inde Armenios petivit$$ Corbulo ,  perfectly fearless ,  left half his army in Syria to retain the forts built on the Euphrates ,  and taking the nearest route ,  which also was not deficient in supplies ,  marched through the country of Commagene ,  then through Cappadocia ,  and thence into Armenia
 comitabantur exercitum praeter alia sueta bello magna vis camelorum onusta frumenti , ut simul hostem famemque depelleret$$ Beside the other usual accompaniments of war ,  his army was followed by a great number of camels laden with corn ,  to keep off famine as well as the enemy
 primum e perculsis Paccium primi pili centurionem obvium habuit , dein plerosque militum quos diversas fugae causas obtendentes redire ad signa et clementiam Paeti experiri monebat$$ The first he met of the defeated army was Paccius ,  a first-rank centurion ,  then many of the soldiers ,  whom ,  when they pleaded various excuses for flight ,  he advised to return to their standards and throw themselves on the mercy of Paetus
 se nisi victoribus immitem esse$$ For himself ,  he said ,  he had no forgiveness but for the victorious
 simul suas legiones adire , hortari priorum admonere , novam gloriam ostendere$$ As he spoke ,  he went up to his legions ,  cheering them and reminding them of their past career ,  and pointing the way to new glory
 non vicos aut oppida Armeniorum , sed castra Romana duasque in iis legiones pretium laboris peti$$ It was not to villages or towns of Armenia ,  but to a Roman camp with two legions ,  a worthy recompense for their efforts ,  that they were bound
 si singulis manipularibus praecipua servati civis corona imperatoria manu tribueretur , quod illud et quantum decus , ubi par eorum numerus aspiceretur , qui adtulissent salutem et qui accepissent! his atque talibus in commune alacres (et erant quos pericula fratrum aut propinquorum propriis stimulis incenderent) continuum diu noctuque iter properabant$$ If each common soldier were to have bestowed on him by the emperor's hand the special honour of a crown for a rescued citizen ,  how wonderfully great the glory ,  when the numbers would be equal of those who had brought and of those had received deliverance Roused by these and like words into a common enthusiasm ,  and some too were filled with an ardour peculiarly their own by the perils of brothers and kinsfolk ,  they hurried on by day and night their uninterrupted march
 Eoque intentius Vologaeses premere obsessos , modo vallum legionum , modo castellum , quo imbellis aetas defendebatur , adpugnare , propius incedens quam mos Parthis , si ea temeritate hostem in proelium eliceret$$ All the more vigorously did Vologeses press the besieged ,  now attacking the legions' entrenchments ,  and now again the fortress ,  which guarded those whose years unfitted them for war He advanced closer than is the Parthian practice ,  seeking to lure the enemy to an engagement by such rashness
 at illi vix contuberniis extracti , nec aliud quam munimenta propugnabant , pars iussu ducis , et alii propria ignavia aut Corbulonem opperientes , ac vis si ingrueret , provisis exemplis Caudinae Numantinaeque pacis$$ They ,  however ,  could hardly be dragged out of their tents ,  and would merely defend their lives ,  some held back by the general's order ,  others by their own cowardice they seemed to be awaiting Corbulo ,  and should they be overpowered by force ,  they had before them the examples of Candium and Numantia
 neque eandem vim Samnitibus , Italico populo , aut Hispanis quam Parthis , Romani imperii aemulis validam quoque et laudatam antiquitatem , quotiens fortuna contra daret , saluti consuluisse$$ Neither the Samnites ,  Italian people as they were ,  nor the Carthaginians ,  the rivals of the Roman empire ,  were ,  it seemed ,  equally formidable ,  and even the men of old ,  with all their strength and glory ,  whenever fortune was adverse ,  had taken thought for safety
 qua desperatione exercitus dux subactus primas tamen litteras ad Vologaesen non supplices , sed in modum querentis composuit , quod pro Armeniis semper Romanae dicionis aut subiectis regi , quem imperator delegisset , hostilia faceret$$ The general ,  although he was overcome by the despair of his army ,  first wrote a letter to Vologeses ,  not a suppliant petition ,  but in a tone of remonstrance against the doing of hostile acts on behalf of the Armenians ,  who always had been under Roman dominion ,  or subject to a king chosen by the emperor
 pacem ex aequo utilem ne praesentia tantum spectaret$$ Peace ,  he reminded him ,  was equally for the interest of both ,  and it would be well for him not to look only at the present
 ipsum adversus duas legiones totis regni viribus advenisse at Romanis orbem terrarum reliquum , quo bellum iuvarent$$ He indeed had advanced with the whole strength of his kingdom against two legions ,  while the Romans had all the rest of the world with which to sustain the war
 Ad eo Vologaeses nihil pro causa , sed opperiendos sibi fratres Pacorum ac Tiridaten rescripsit illum locum tempusque consilio destinatum , quid de Armenia cernerent adiecisse deos dignum Arsacidarum , simul ut de legionibus Romanis statuerent$$ To this Vologeses replied nothing to the purpose ,  but merely that he must wait for his brothers Pacorus and Tiridates ,  that the place and time of their meeting had been fixed on as the occasion when they would decide about Armenia ,  and that heaven had granted them a further honour ,  well worthy of the Arsacids ,  the having to determine the fate of Roman legions
 missi posthac Paeto nuntii et regis conloquium petitum , qui Vasacen praefectum equitatus ire iussit$$ Messengers were then despatched by Paetus and an interview requested with the king ,  who ordered Vasaces ,  the commander of the cavalry ,  to go
 tum Paetus Lucullos , Pompeios et si qua Caesares obtinendae donandaeve Armeniae egerant , Vasaces imaginem retinendi largiendive penes nos , vim penes Parthos memorat$$ Thereupon Paetus dwelt on the memories of the Luculli and Pompeii ,  and of all that the Caesars had done in the way of holding or giving away Armenia ,  while Vasaces declared that we had the mere shadow of possession and of bestowing ,  but the Parthians ,  the reality of power
 et multum in vicem disceptato , Monobazus Adiabenus in diem posterum testis iis quae pepigissent adhibetur$$ After much arguing on both sides ,  Monobazus of the Adiabeni was called the next day to be a witness to the stipulations into which they had entered
 placuitque liberari obsidio legiones et decedere omnem militem finibus Armeniorum castellaque et commeatus Parthis tradi , quibus perpetratis copia Vologaesi fieret mittendi ad Neronem legatos$$ It was agreed that the legions should be released from the blockade ,  that all the troops should quit Armenian territory ,  and that the forts and supplies should be surrendered to the Parthians ,  and when all this had been completed ,  Vologeses was to have full permission to send envoys to Nero
 Interim flumini Arsaniae (is castra praefluebat) pontem imposuit , specie sibi illud iter expedientis , sed Parthi quasi documentum victoriae iusserant$$ Meanwhile Paetus threw a bridge over the river Arsanias ,  which flowed by the camp ,  apparently with the view of facilitating his march It was the Parthians ,  however ,  who had required this ,  as an evidence of their victory
 namque iis usui fuit , nostri per diversum iere$$ for the bridge was of use to them ,  while our men went a different way
 addidit rumor sub iugum missas legiones et alia ex rebus infaustis , quorum simulacrum ab Armeniis usurpatum est$$ Rumour added that the legions had been passed under the yoke ,  with other miserable disgraces ,  of which the Armenians had borrowed imitations
 namque et munimenta ingressi sunt , antequam agmen Romanum excederet , et circumstetere vias , captiva olim mancipia aut iumenta adgnoscentes abstrahentesque$$ For they not only entered our lines before the Roman army began to retire ,  but also stood about the camp streets ,  recognizing and dragging off slaves or beasts of burden which we had previously captured
 raptae etiam vestes , retenta arma , pavido milite et concedente , ne qua proelii causa existeret$$ They even seized clothes and detained weapons ,  for the soldiers were utterly cowed and gave up everything ,  so that no cause for fighting might arise
 Vologaeses armis et corporibus caesorum aggeratis , quo cladem nostram testaretur , visu fugientium legionum abstinuit$$ Vologeses having piled up the arms and bodies of the slain in order to attest our defeat ,  refrained from gazing on the fugitive legions
 fama moderationis quaerebatur , postquam superbiam expleverat$$ He sought a character for moderation after he had glutted his pride
 flumen Arsaniam elephanto insidens , proximus quisque regem vi equorum perrupere , quia rumor incesserat pontem cessurum oneri dolo fabricantium$$ Seated himself on an elephant ,  he crossed the river Arsanias ,  while those next to his person rushed through it at the utmost speed of their horses
 sed qui ingredi ausi sunt , validum et fidum intellexere$$ for a rumour had gained ground that the bridge would give way ,  through the trickery of its builders
 Ducum inter se brevis sermo secutus est , hoc conquerente inritum laborem , potuisse bellum fuga Parthorum finiri ille integra utrique cuncta respondit converterent aquilas et iuncti invaderent Armeniam abscessu Vologaesis infirmatam$$ Then followed a short conversation between the generals While Corbulo complained that his efforts had been fruitless and that the war might have been ended with the flight of the Parthians ,  Paetus replied that for neither of them was anything lost ,  and urged that they should reverse the eagles ,  and with their united forces invade Armenia ,  much weakened ,  as it was ,  by the departure of Vologeses
 non ea imperatoris habere mandata Corbulo$$ Corbulo said that he had no such instructions from the emperor
 periculo legionum commotum e provincia egressum quando in incerto habeantur Parthorum conatus , Syriam repetiturum sic quoque optimam fortunam orandam , ut pedes confectus spatiis itinerum alacrem et facilitate camporum praevenientem equitem adsequeretur$$ it was the peril of the legions which had stirred him to leave his province ,  and ,  as there was uncertainty about the designs of the Parthians ,  he should return to Syria ,  and ,  even as it was ,  he must pray for fortune under her most favourable aspect in order that the infantry ,  wearied out with long marches ,  might keep pace with the enemy's untiring cavalry ,  certain to outstrip him on the plains ,  which facilitated their movements
 exim Paetus per Cappadociam hibernavit$$ Paetus then went into winter quarters in Cappadocia
 at Vologaesi ad Corbulonem missi nuntii , detraheret castella trans Euphraten amnemque , ut olim , medium faceret$$ Vologeses ,  however ,  sent a message to Corbulo ,  requiring him to remove the fortresses on the further bank of the Euphrates ,  and to leave the river to be ,  as formerly ,  the boundary between them
 ille Armeniam quoque diversis praesidiis vacuam fieri expostulabat$$ Corbulo also demanded the evacuation of Armenia by the garrisons posted throughout it
 et postremo concessit rex dirutaque quae Euphraten ultra communiverat Corbulo , et Armenii sine arbitro relicti sunt$$ At last the king yielded ,  all the positions fortified by Corbulo beyond the Euphrates were destroyed ,  and the Armenians too left without a master
 At Romae tropaea de Parthis arcusque medio Capitolini montis sistebantur , decreta ab senatu integro adhuc bello neque tum omissa , dum adspectui consulitur spreta conscientia$$ At Rome meanwhile trophies for the Parthian war ,  and arches were erected in the centre of the Capitoline hill these had been decreed by the Senate ,  while the war was yet undecided ,  and even now they were not given up ,  appearances being consulted ,  in disregard of known facts
 quin et dissimulandis rerum externarum curis Nero frumentum plebis vetustate corruptum in Tiberim iecit , quo securitatem annonae sustentaret$$ And to hide his anxious fears about foreign affairs ,  Nero threw the people's corn ,  which was so old as to be spoilt ,  into the Tiber ,  with the view of keeping up a sense of security about the supplies
 cuius pretio nihil additum est , quamvis ducentas ferme naves portu in ipso violentia tempestatis et centum alias Tiberi subvectas fortuitus ignis absumpsisset$$ There was no addition to the price ,  although about two hundred ships were destroyed in the very harbour by a violent storm ,  and one hundred more ,  which had sailed up the Tiber ,  by an accidental fire
 tres dein consulares , Lucius Pisonem , Ducenium Geminum , Pompeium Paulinum vectigalibus publicis praeposuit , cum insectatione priorum principum , qui gravitate sumptuum iustos reditus anteissent$$ Nero next appointed three ex-consuls ,  Lucius Piso ,  Ducennius Geminus ,  and Pompeius Paulinus ,  to the management of the public revenues ,  and inveighed at the same time against former emperors whose heavy expenditure had exceeded their legitimate income
 se annuum sexcenties sestertium rei publicae largiri$$ He himself ,  he said ,  made the state an annual present of sixty million sesterces
 Percrebuerat et tempestate pravus mos , cum propinquis comitiis aut sorte provinciarum plerique orbi fictis adoptionibus adsciscerent filios , praeturasque et provincias inter patres sortiti statim emitterent manu , quos adoptaverant$$ A very demoralizing custom had at this time become rife ,  of fictitious adoptions of children ,  on the eve of the elections or of the assignment of the provinces ,  by a number of childless persons ,  who ,  after obtaining along with real fathers praetorships and provinces ,  forthwith dismissed from paternal control the sons whom they had adopted
 igitur qui filios genuerant magna cum invidia senatum adeunt , ius naturae , labores educandi adversus fraudem et artes et brevitatem adoptionis enumerant$$ An appeal was made to the Senate under a keen sense of wrong Parents pleaded natural rights and the anxieties of nurture against fraudulent evasions and the brief ceremony of adoption
 satis pretii esse orbis , quod multa securitate , nullis oneribus gratiam honores , cuncta prompta et obvia haberent$$ It was ,  they argued ,  sufficient reward for the childless to have influence and distinction ,  everything ,  in short ,  easy and open to them ,  without a care and without a burden
 sibi promissa legum diu exspectata in ludibrium verti , quando quis sine sollicitudine parens , sine luctu orbus longa patrum vota repente adaequaret factum ex eo senatus consultum , ne simulata adoptio in ulla parte muneris publici iuvaret ac ne usurpandis quidem hereditatibus prodesset$$ For themselves ,  they found that the promises held out by the laws ,  for which they had long waited ,  were turned into mockery ,  when one who knew nothing of a parent's solicitude or of the sorrows of bereavement could rise in a moment to the level of a father's long deferred hopes On this ,  a decree of the Senate was passed that a fictitious adoption should be of no avail in any department of the public service ,  or even hold good for acquiring an inheritance
 Exim Claudius Timarchus Cretensis reus agitur , ceteris criminibus , ut solent praevalidi provincialium et opibus nimiis ad iniurias minorum elati$$ Next came the prosecution of Claudius Timarchus of Crete ,  on such charges as often fall on very influential provincials ,  whom immense wealth has emboldened to the oppression of the weak
 una vox eius usque ad contumeliam senatus penetraverat , quod dictitasset in sua potestate situm , an proconsulibus , qui Cretam obtinuissent , grates agerentur$$ But one speech of his had gone to the extremity of a gross insult to the Senate for he had repeatedly declared that it was in his power to decide whether the proconsuls who had governed Crete should receive the thanks of the province
 quam occasionem Paetus Thrasea ad bonum publicum vertens , postquam de reo censuerat provincia Creta depellendum , haec addidit$$ Paetus Thrasea ,  turning the occasion to public advantage ,  after having stated his opinion that the accused ought to be expelled from Crete ,  further spoke as follows 
 usu probatum est , patres conscripti , leges egregias , exempla honesta apud bonos ex delictis aliorum gigni$$ It is found by experience ,  Senators ,  that admirable laws and right precedents among the good have their origin in the misdeeds of others
 sic oratorum licentia Cinciam rogationem , candidatorum ambitus Iulias leges , magistratuum avaritia Calpurnia scita pepererunt$$ Thus the license of advocates resulted in the Cincian bill the corrupt practices of candidates ,  in the Julian laws
 nam culpa quam poena tempore prior , emendari quam peccare posterius est$$ the rapacity of magistrates ,  in the Calpurnian enactments
 ergo adversus novam provincialium superbiam dignum fide constantiaque Romana capiamus consilium , quo tutelae sociorum nihil derogetur , nobis opinio decedat , qualis quisque habeatur , alibi quam in civium iudicio esse$$ For ,  in point of time ,  guilt comes before punishment ,  and correction follows after delinquency And therefore ,  to meet the new insolence of provincials ,  let us adopt a measure worthy of Roman good faith and resolution ,  whereby our allies may lose nothing of our protection ,  while public opinion may cease to say of us ,  that the estimate of a man's character is to found anywhere rather than in the judgment of our citizens
 Olim quidem non modo praetor aut consul , sed privati etiam mittebantur , qui provincias viserent et quid de cuiusque obsequio videretur referrent , trepidabantque gentes de aestimatione singulorum$$ Formerly ,  it was not only a praetor or a consul ,  but private persons also ,  who were sent to inspect the provinces ,  and to report what they thought about each man's loyalty And nations were timidly sensitive to the opinion of individuals
 at nunc colimus externos et adulamur , et quo modo ad nutum alicuius grates , ita promptius accusatio decernitur$$ But now we court foreigners and flatter them ,  and just as there is a vote of thanks at any one's pleasure ,  so even more eagerly is a prosecution decided on
 decernaturque et maneat provincialibus potentiam suam tali modo ostentandi sed laus falsa et precibus expressa perinde cohibeatur quam malitia , quam crudelitas$$ Well let it be decided on ,  and let the provincials retain the right of showing their power in this fashion ,  but as for false praise which has been extorted by entreaties ,  let it be as much checked as fraud or tyranny
 plura saepe peccantur , dum demeremur quam dum offendimus$$ More faults are often committed ,  while we are trying to oblige than while we are giving offence
 quaedam immo virtutes odio sunt , severitas obstinata , invictus adversum gratiam animus$$ Nay ,  some virtues are actually hated inflexible strictness ,  for example ,  and a temper proof against partiality
 inde initia magistratuum nostrorum meliora ferme et finis inclinat , dum in modum candidatorum suffragia conquirimus$$ Consequently ,  our magistrates' early career is generally better than its close ,  which deteriorates ,  when we are anxiously seeking votes ,  like candidates
 quae si arceantur , aequalibus atque constantius provinciae regentur$$ If such practices are stopped ,  our provinces will be ruled more equitably and more steadily
 nam ut metu repetundarum infracta avaritia est , ita vetita gratiarum actione ambitio cohibebitur$$ For as the dread of a charge of extortion has been a check to rapacity ,  so ,  by prohibiting the vote of thanks ,  will the pursuit of popularity be restrained
 Magno adsensu celebrata sententia non tamen senatus consultum perfici potuit abnuentibus consulibus ea de re relatum$$ This opinion was hailed with great unanimity ,  but the Senate's resolution could not be finally passed ,  as the consuls decided that there had been no formal motion on the subject
 mox auctore principe sanxere , ne quis ad concilium sociorum referret agendas apud senatum pro praetoribus prove consulibus grates , neu quis ea legatione fungeretur$$ Then ,  at the emperor's suggestion ,  they decreed that no one was to propose to any council of our allies that a vote of thanks ought to be given in the Senate to propraetors or proconsuls ,  and that no one was to discharge such a mission
 Isdem consulibus gymnasium ictu fulminibus conflagravit , effigies in eo Neronis ad informe aes liquefacta$$ During the same consulship a gymnasium was wholly consumed by a stroke of lightning ,  and a statue of Nero within it was melted down to a shapeless mass of bronze

 locus puerperio colonia Antium fuit , ubi ipse generatus erat$$ The place of her confinement was the colony of Antium ,  where the emperor himself was born
 iam senatus uterum Poppaeae commendaverat dis votaque publice susceperat , quae multiplicata exsolutaque$$ Already had the Senate commended Poppaea's safety to the gods ,  and had made vows in the State's name ,  which were repeated again and again and duly discharged
 et additae supplicationes templumque fecunditatis et certamen ad exemplar Actiacae religionis decretum , utque Fortunarum effigies aureae in solio Capitolini Iovis locarentur , ludicrum circense , ut Iuliae genti apud Bovillas , ita Claudiae Domitiaeque apud Antium ederetur$$ To these was added a public thanksgiving ,  and a temple was decreed to the goddess of fecundity ,  as well as games and contests after the type of the ceremonies commemorative of Actium ,  and golden images of the two Fortunes were to be set up on the throne of Jupiter of the Capitol Shows too of the circus were to be exhibited in honour of the Claudian and Domitian families at Antium ,  like those at Bovillae in commemoration of the Julii
 quae fluxa fuere , quartum intra mensem defuncta infante$$ Transient distinctions all of them ,  as within four months the infant died
 rursusque exortae adulationes censentium honorem divae et pulvinar aedemque et sacerdotem$$ Again there was an outburst of flattery ,  men voting the honours of deification ,  of a shrine ,  a temple ,  and a priest
 atque ipse ut laetitiae , it maeroris immodicus egit$$ The emperor ,  too ,  was as excessive in his grief as he had been in his joy
 adnotatum est , omni senatu Antium sub recentem partum effuso , Thraseam prohibitum immoto animo praenuntiam imminentis caedis contumeliam excepisse$$ It was observed that when all the Senate rushed out to Antium to honour the recent birth ,  Thrasea was forbidden to go ,  and received with fearless spirit an affront which foreboded his doom
 secutam dehinc vocem Caesaris ferunt , qua reconciliatum se Thraseae apud Senecam iactaverit , ac Senecam Caesari gratulatum$$ Then followed ,  as rumour says ,  an expression from the emperor ,  in which he boasted to Seneca of his reconciliation with Thrasea ,  on which Seneca congratulated him
 unde gloria egregiis viris et pericula gliscebant$$ And now henceforth the glory and the peril of these illustrious men grew greater
 As Paetuss despatch contradicted this letter from Vologeses and implied that matters were unchanged , the centurion who had arrived with the envoys was questioned as to the state of Armenia He replied that all the Romans had quitted it$$ Inter quae veris principio legati Parthorum mandata regis Vologaesis litterasque in eandem formam attulere 
 Then was perceived the mockery of the barbarians in petitioning for what they had wrested from us , and Nero consulted with the chief men of the State whether they should accept a dangerous war or a disgraceful peace There was no hesitation about war Corbulo , who had known our soldiers and the enemy for so many years , was appointed to conduct it , that there might be no more blunders through any other officers incapacity$$  se priora et totiens iactata super obtineneda Armenia nunc omittere ,  quoniam dii ,  quamvis potentium populorum arbitri ,  possessionem Parthis non sine ignominia Romana tradidissent
 for people were utterly disgusted with Paetus So the envoys were sent back without an answer , but with some presents , in order to inspire a hope that Tiridates would not make the same request in vain , if only he presented his petition in person$$ nuper clausum Tigranen ,  post Paetum legionesque ,  cum opprimere posset ,  incolumes dimisisse
 The administration of Syria was intrusted to Caius Itius , and the military forces to Corbulo , to which was added the fifteenth legion , under the leadership of Marius Celsus , from Pannonia$$ satis adprobatam vim datum et lenitatis experimentum
 Written orders were sent to the tetrarchs , the tributaries , kings , prefects and procurators , and all the praetors who governed the neighbouring provinces , to obey Corbulos commands , as his powers were enlarged on much the same scale as that which the Roman people had granted to Cneius Pompeius on the eve of his war against the Pirates$$ nec recusaturum Tiridaten accipiendo diademati in urbem venire ,  nisi sacerdotii religione attineretur 
 When Paetus returned and dreaded something worse , the emperor thought it enough to reproach him with a jest , to the effect that he pardoned him at once , lest one so ready to take fright might sink under prolonged suspense$$  iturum ad signa et effigies principis ,  ubi legionibus coram regnum auspicaretur
 Talibus Vologaesis litteris , qui Paetus diversa tamquam rebus integris scribebat , interrogatus centurio , qui cum legatis advenerat , quo in statu Armenia esset , omnes inde Romanos excessisse respondit$$ Inter quae veris principio legati Parthorum mandata regis Vologaesis litterasque in eandem formam attulere

 tum lustratum rite exercitum ad contionem vocat orditurque magnifica de auspiciis imperatoris rebusque a se gestis , adversa in inscitiam Paeti declinans , multa acutoritate , quae viro militari pro facundia erat$$ Then ,  after the due lustration of his army ,  he called them together for an harangue ,  and began with grand allusions to the imperial auspices ,  and to his own achievements ,  while he attributed their disasters to the incapacity of Paetus He spoke with much impressiveness ,  which in him ,  as a military man ,  was as good as eloquence
 Mox iter Lucius Lucullo quondam penetratum , apertis quae vetustas obsaepserat , pergit$$ He then pursued the route opened up in former days by Lucius Lucullus ,  clearing away the obstructions of long years
 et venientes Tiridatis Bologaesisque de pace legatos haud aspernatus , adiungit iis centuriones cum mandatis non immitibus$$ Envoys who came to him from Tiridates and Vologeses about peace ,  he did not repulse ,  but sent back with them some centurions with a message anything but harsh

 multa Romanis secunda , quaedam Parthis evenisse , documento adversus superbiam$$ Many successes have fallen to the lot of Rome ,  some to that of Parthia ,  as a warning against pride
 proinde et Tiridati conducere intactum vastationibus regnum dono accipere , et Bologaesen melius societate Romana quam damnis mutuis genti Parthorum consulturum$$ Therefore ,  it is to the advantage of Tiridates to accept as a gift a kingdom yet unhurt by the ravages of war ,  and Vologeses will better consult the welfare of the Parthian people by an alliance with Rome than by mutual injuries

 illic veneratus deos , cum Vestae quoque templum inisset , repente cunctos per artus tremens , seu numine exterrente , seu facinorum recordatione numquam timore vacuus , deseruit inceptum , cunctas sibi curas amore patriae leviores dictitans$$ There he adored the gods then he entered also the temple of Vesta ,  and there feeling a sudden trembling throughout his limbs ,  either from terror inspired by the deity or because ,  from the remembrance of his crimes ,  he was never free from fear ,  he relinquished his purpose ,  repeatedly saying that all his plans were of less account than his love of his country
 vidisse maestos civium vultus , audire secretas querimonias , quod tantum itineris aditurus esset , cuius ne modicos quidem egressus tolerarent , sueti adversum fortuita adspectu principis refoveri$$ He had seen the sad countenances of the citizens ,  he heard their secret complainings at the prospect of his entering on so long a journey ,  when they could not bear so much as his brief excursions ,  accustomed as they were to cheer themselves under mischances by the sight of the emperor
 ergo ut in privatis necessitudinibus proxima pignora praevalerent , ita in re publica populum Romanum vim plurimam habere parendumque retinenti$$ Hence ,  as in private relationships the closest ties were the strongest ,  so the people of Rome had the most powerful claims and must be obeyed in their wish to retain him
 haec atque talia plebi volentia fuere , voluptatum cupidine et , quae praecipua cura est , rei frumentariae angustias , si abesset , metuenti$$ These and the like sentiments suited the people ,  who craved amusement ,  and feared ,  always their chief anxiety ,  scarcity of corn ,  should he be absent

 initium in ea parte circi ortum , quae Palatino Caelioque montibus contigua est , ubi per tabernas , quibus id mercimonium inerat , quo flamma alitur , simul coeptus ignis et statim validus ac vento citus longitudinem circi conripuit$$ It had its beginning in that part of the circus which adjoins the Palatine and Caelian hills ,  where ,  amid the shops containing inflammable wares ,  the conflagration both broke out and instantly became so fierce and so rapid from the wind that it seized in its grasp the entire length of the circus
 neque enim domus munimentis saeptae vel templa muris cincta aut quid aliud morae interiacebat$$ For here there were no houses fenced in by solid masonry ,  or temples surrounded by walls ,  or any other obstacle to interpose delay
 impetus pervagatum incendium plana primum , deinde in edita adsurgens et rursus inferiora populando anteiit remedia velocitate mali et obnoxia urbe artis itineribus hucque et illuc flexis atque enoribus vicis , qualis vetus Roman fuit$$ The blaze in its fury ran first through the level portions of the city ,  then rising to the hills ,  while it again devastated every place below them ,  it outstripped all preventive measures so rapid was the mischief and so completely at its mercy the city ,  with those narrow winding passages and irregular streets ,  which characterised old Rome
 ad hoc lamenta paventium feminarum , fessa aetate aut rudis pueritiae aetas , quique sibi quique aliis consulebat , dum trahunt invalidos aut opperiuntur , pars mora , pars festinans , cuncta impediebant$$ Added to this were the wailings of terror-stricken women ,  the feebleness of age ,  the helpless inexperience of childhood ,  the crowds who sought to save themselves or others ,  dragging out the infirm or waiting for them ,  and by their hurry in the one case ,  by their delay in the other ,  aggravating the confusion
 et saepe , dum in tergum respectant , lateribus aut fronte circumveniebantur , vel si in proxima evaserant , illis quoque igni correptis , etiam quae longinqua crediderant in eodem casu reperiebant$$ Often ,  while they looked behind them ,  they were intercepted by flames on their side or in their face Or if they reached a refuge close at hand ,  when this too was seized by the fire ,  they found that ,  even places ,  which they had imagined to be remote ,  were involved in the same calamity
 postremo , quid vitarent quid peterent ambigui , complere vias , sterni per agros quidam amissis omnibus fortunis , diurni quoque victus , alii caritate suorum , quos eripere nequiverant , quamvis patente effugio interiere$$ At last ,  doubting what they should avoid or whither betake themselves ,  they crowded the streets or flung themselves down in the fields ,  while some who had lost their all ,  even their very daily bread ,  and others out of love for their kinsfolk ,  whom they had been unable to rescue ,  perished ,  though escape was open to them
 nec quisquam defendere audebat , crebris multorum minis restinguere prohibentium , et quia alii palam facies iaciebant atque esse sibi auctorem vociferabantur , sive ut raptus licentius exercerent seu iussu$$ And no one dared to stop the mischief ,  because of incessant menaces from a number of persons who forbade the extinguishing of the flames ,  because again others openly hurled brands ,  and kept shouting that there was one who gave them authority ,  either seeking to plunder more freely ,  or obeying orders
 Sexto demum die apud imas Esquilias finis incendio factus , prorutis per immensum aedificiis , ut continuae violentiae campus et velut vacuum caelum occurreret$$ At last ,  after five days ,  an end was put to the conflagration at the foot of the Esquiline hill ,  by the destruction of all buildings on a vast space ,  so that the violence of the fire was met by clear ground and an open sky
 necdum positus metus aut redierat plebi spes rursum grassatus ignis , patulis magis urbis locis$$ But before people had laid aside their fears ,  the flames returned ,  with no less fury this second time ,  and especially in the spacious districts of the city
 eoque strages hominum minor delubra deum et porticus amoenitati dicatae latius procidere$$ Consequently ,  though there was less loss of life ,  the temples of the gods ,  and the porticoes which were devoted to enjoyment ,  fell in a yet more widespread ruin
 plusque infamiae id incendium habuit , quia praediis Tigellini Aemilianis proruperat videbaturque Nero condendae urbis novae et cognomento suo appellandae gloriam quaerere$$ And to this conflagration there attached the greater infamy because it broke out on the Aemilian property of Tigellinus ,  and it seemed that Nero was aiming at the glory of founding a new city and calling it by his name
 quippe in regiones quattuordecim Romam dividitur , quarum quattuor integrae manebant , tres solo tenus deiectae , septem reliquis pauca tectorum vestigia supererant , lacera et semusta$$ Rome ,  indeed ,  is divided into fourteen districts ,  four of which remained uninjured ,  three were levelled to the ground ,  while in the other seven were left only a few shattered ,  half-burnt relics of houses
 Ceterum Nero usus est patriae ruinis exstruxitque domum , in qua haud proinde gemmae et aurum miraculo essent , solita pridem et luxu vulgata , quam arva et stagna et in modum solitudinem hinc silvae , inde aperta spatia et prospetus , magistris et machinatoribus Severo et Celere , quibus ingenium et audacia erat etiam , quae natura denegavisset , per artem temptare et viribus principis inludere$$ Nero meanwhile availed himself of his country's desolation ,  and erected a mansion in which the jewels and gold ,  long familiar objects ,  quite vulgarised by our extravagance ,  were not so marvellous as the fields and lakes ,  with woods on one side to resemble a wilderness ,  and ,  on the other ,  open spaces and extensive views The directors and contrivers of the work were Severus and Celer ,  who had the genius and the audacity to attempt by art even what nature had refused ,  and to fool away an emperor's resources
 namque ab lacu Averno navigabilem fossam usque ad ostia Tibernia depressuros promiserant squalenti litore aut per montes adversos neque enim aliud umidum gignendis aquis occirrit quam Pomptinae paludes$$ They had actually undertaken to sink a navigable canal from the lake Avernus to the mouths of the Tiber along a barren shore or through the face of hills ,  where one meets with no moisture which could supply water ,  except the Pomptine marshes
 cetera abrupta aut arentia , ac si perrumpi possent , intolerandus labor nec satis causae$$ The rest of the country is broken rock and perfectly dry Even if it could be cut through ,  the labour would be intolerable ,  and there would be no adequate result
 Nero tamen , ut erat incredibilium cupitor , effodere proxima Averno iuga conisus est , manentque vestigia inritae spei$$ Nero ,  however ,  with his love of the impossible ,  endeavoured to dig through the nearest hills to Avernus ,  and there still remain the traces of his disappointed hope
 Ceterum urbis quae domui supererant non , ut post Gallica incendia , nulla distinctione nec passim erecta , sed dimensis vicorum ordinibus et latis viarum spatiis cohibitaque aedificiorum altitudine ac patefactis areis additisque porticibus , quae frontem insularum protegerent$$ Of Rome meanwhile ,  so much as was left unoccupied by his mansion ,  was not built up ,  as it had been after its burning by the Gauls ,  without any regularity or in any fashion ,  but with rows of streets according to measurement ,  with broad thoroughfares ,  with a restriction on the height of houses ,  with open spaces ,  and the further addition of colonnades ,  as a protection to the frontage of the blocks of tenements
 eas proticus Nero sua pecunia exstructurum purgatasque areas dominis traditurum pollicitus est$$ These colonnades Nero promised to erect at his own expense ,  and to hand over the open spaces ,  when cleared of the debris ,  to the ground landlords
 addidit praemia pro cuiusque ordine et rei familiaris copiis , finivitque tempus , intra quod effectis domibus aut insulis apiscerentur$$ He also offered rewards proportioned to each person's position and property ,  and prescribed a period within which they were to obtain them on the completion of so many houses or blocks of building
 ruderi accipiendo Ostienses paludes destinabat , utique naves , quae frumentum Tiberi subvectavissent , onustae rudere decurrerent , aedificiaque ipsa certa sui parte sine trabibus saxo Gabino Albanove solidarentur , quod is lapis ignibus impervius est$$ He fixed on the marshes of Ostia for the reception of the rubbish ,  and arranged that the ships which had brought up corn by the Tiber ,  should sail down the river with cargoes of this rubbish The buildings themselves ,  to a certain height ,  were to be solidly constructed ,  without wooden beams ,  of stone from Gabii or Alba ,  that material being impervious to fire
 iam aqua privatorum licentia intercepta quo largior et pluribus locis in publicum flueret , custodes et subsidia reprimendis ignibus in propatulo quisque haberet$$ And to provide that the water which individual license had illegally appropriated ,  might flow in greater abundance in several places for the public use ,  officers were appointed ,  and everyone was to have in the open court the means of stopping a fire
 nec communione parietum , sed propriis quaeque muris ambirentur$$ Every building ,  too ,  was to be enclosed by its own proper wall ,  not by one common to others
 ea ex utilitate accepta decorem quoque novae urbi attulere$$ These changes which were liked for their utility ,  also added beauty to the new city
 erant tamen qui crederent veterem illam formam salubritati magis conduxisse , quoniam angustiae itinerum et altitudo tectorum non perinde solis vapore perrumperentur$$ Some ,  however ,  thought that its old arrangement had been more conducive to health ,  inasmuch as the narrow streets with the elevation of the roofs were not equally penetrated by the sun's heat ,  while now the open space ,  unsheltered by any shade ,  was scorched by a fiercer glow
 Et haec quidem humanis consiliis providebantur$$ Such indeed were the precautions of human wisdom
 mox petita a dis piacula aditique Sibyllae libri , ex quibus supplicatum Volcano et Cereri Proserpinaeque , ac propitiata Iuno per matronas , primum in Capitolio , deinde apud proximum mare , unde hausta aqua templum et simulacrum deae perspersum est$$ The next thing was to seek means of propitiating the gods ,  and recourse was had to the Sibylline books ,  by the direction of which prayers were offered to Vulcanus ,  Ceres ,  and Proserpina Juno ,  too ,  was entreated by the matrons ,  first ,  in the Capitol ,  then on the nearest part of the coast ,  whence water was procured to sprinkle the fane and image of the goddess
 et sellisternia ac pervigilia celebravere feminae , quibus mariti erant$$ And there were sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women
 Sed non ope humana , non largitionibus principis aut deum placamentis decedebat infamia , quin iussum incendium crederetur$$ But all human efforts ,  all the lavish gifts of the emperor ,  and the propitiations of the gods ,  did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order
 ergo abolendo rumori Nero subdidit reos et quaesitissimis poenis adfecit , quos per flagitia invisos vulgus Chrestianos appellabat$$ Consequently ,  to get rid of the report ,  Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations ,  called Christians by the populace
 auctor nominis eius Christus Tibero imperitante per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum supplicio adfectus erat repressaque in praesens exitiablilis superstitio rursum erumpebat , non modo per Iudaeam , originem eius mali , sed per urbem etiam , quo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt celebranturque$$ Christus ,  from whom the name had its origin ,  suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators ,  Pontius Pilatus ,  and a most mischievous superstition ,  thus checked for the moment ,  again broke out not only in Judaea ,  the first source of the evil ,  but even in Rome ,  where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular
 igitur primum correpti qui fatebantur , deinde indicio eorum multitudo ingens haud proinde in crimine incendii quam odio humani generis convicti sunt$$ Accordingly ,  an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty then ,  upon their information ,  an immense multitude was convicted ,  not so much of the crime of firing the city ,  as of hatred against mankind
 et pereuntibus addita ludibria , ut ferarum tergis contecti laniatu canum interirent aut crucibus adfixi aut flammandi atque , ubi defecisset dies , in usum nocturni luminis urerentur$$ Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths Covered with the skins of beasts ,  they were torn by dogs and perished ,  or were nailed to crosses ,  or were doomed to the flames and burnt ,  to serve as a nightly illumination ,  when daylight had expired
 hortos suos ei spectaculo Nero obtulerat , et circense ludicrum edebat , habitu aurigae permixtus plebi vel curriculo insistens$$ Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle ,  and was exhibiting a show in the circus ,  while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car
 unde quamquam adversus sontes et novissima exempla meritos miseratio oriebatur , tamquam non utilitate publica , sed in saevitiam unius absumerentur$$ Hence ,  even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment ,  there arose a feeling of compassion
 Interea conferendis pecuniis pervastata Italia , provinciae eversae sociique populi et quae civitatium liberae vocantur$$ Meanwhile Italy was thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money ,  the provinces were ruined ,  as also the allied nations and the free states ,  as they were called
 inque eam praedam etiam dii cessere , spoliatis in urbe templis egestoque auro , quod triumphis , quod votis omnis populi Romani aetas prospere aut in metu sacraverat$$ Even the gods fell victims to the plunder for the temples in Rome were despoiled and the gold carried off ,  which ,  for a triumph or a vow ,  the Roman people in every age had consecrated in their prosperity or their alarm
 enimvero per Asiam atque Achaiam non dona tantum , sed simulacra numinum abripiebatur , missis in eas provincias Acrato et Secundo Carrinate$$ Throughout Asia and Achaia not only votive gifts ,  but the images of deities were seized ,  Acratus and Secundus Carinas having been sent into those provinces
 ille libertus cuicumque flagitio promptus , hic Graeca doctrina ore tenus exercitus animum bonis artibus non imbuerat$$ The first was a freedman ready for any wickedness the latter ,  as far as speech went ,  was thoroughly trained in Greek learning ,  but he had not imbued his heart with sound principles
 ferebatur Seneca , quo invidiam sacrilegii a semet averteret , longinqui ruris secessum oravisse , et postquam non concedebatur , ficta valetudine , quasi aeger nervis , cubiculum non egressus$$ Seneca ,  it was said ,  to avert from himself the obloquy of sacrilege ,  begged for the seclusion of a remote rural retreat ,  and ,  when it was refused ,  feigning ill health ,  as though he had a nervous ailment ,  would not quit his chamber
 tradidere quidam venenum ei per libertum ipsius , cui nomen Cleonicus , paratum iussu Neronis vitatumque a Seneca proditione liberti seu propria formidine , dum per simplicem victum et agrestibus pomis , ac si sitis admoneret , profluente aqua vitam tolerat$$ According to some writers ,  poison was prepared for him at Nero's command by his own freedman ,  whose name was Cleonicus This Seneca avoided through the freedman's disclosure ,  or his own apprehension ,  while he used to support life on the very simple diet of wild fruits ,  with water from a running stream when thirst prompted
 Ergo dum scelera principis , et finem adesse imperio diligendumque , qui fessis rebus succurreret , inter se aut inter amicos iaciunt , adgregavere Claudium Senecionem , Cervarium Proculum , Vulcacium Araricum , Iulium Augurinum , Munatium Gratum , Antonium Natalem , Marcium Festum , equites Romanos$$ So ,  while they dropped hints among themselves or among their friends about the emperor's crimes ,  the approaching end of empire ,  and the importance of choosing some one to rescue the State in its distress ,  they associated with them Tullius Senecio ,  Cervarius Proculus ,  Vulcatius Araricus ,  Julius Augurinus ,  Munatius Gratus ,  Antonius Natalis ,  and Marcius Festus ,  all Roman knights
 ex quibus Senecio , e praecipua familiaritate Neronis , speciem amicitiae etiam tum retinens eo pluribus periculis conflictabatur$$ Of these Senecio ,  one of those who was specially intimate with Nero ,  still kept up a show of friendship ,  and had consequently to struggle with all the more dangers
 Natalis particeps ad omne secretum Pisoni erat$$ Natalis shared with Piso all his secret plans
 ceteris spes ex novis rebus petebatur$$ The rest built their hopes on revolution
 adscitae sunt super Subrium et Sulpicium , de quibus rettuli , militares manus Gavius silvanus et Statius Proxumus tribuni cohortium praetoriarum , Maximus Scaurus et Venetus Paulus centuriones$$ Besides Subrius and Sulpicius ,  whom I have already mentioned ,  they invited the aid of military strength ,  of Gavius Silvanus and Statius Proximus ,  tribunes of praetorian cohorts ,  and of two centurions ,  Maximus Scaurus and Venetus Paulus
 sed summum robur in Faenio Rufo praefecto videbatur , quem vita famaque laudatum per saevitiam impudicitiamque Tigellinus in animo principis anteibat , fatigabatque criminationibus ac saepe in metum adduxerat quasi adulterum Agrippinae et desiderio eius ultioni intentum$$ But their mainstay ,  it was thought ,  was Faenius Rufus ,  the commander of the guard ,  a man of esteemed life and character ,  to whom Tigellinus with his brutality and shamelessness was superior in the emperor's regard He harassed him with calumnies ,  and had often put him in terror by hinting that he had been Agrippina's paramour ,  and from sorrow at her loss was intent on vengeance
 igitur ubi coniuratis praefectum quoque praetorii in partes descendisse crebro ipsius sermone facta fides , promptius iam de tempore ac loco caedis agitabant$$ And so ,  when the conspirators were assured by his own repeated language that the commander of the praetorian guard had come over to their side ,  they once more eagerly discussed the time and place of the fatal deed
 et cepisse impetum Subrius Flavus ferebatur in scaena canentem Neronem adgrediendi , aut cum ardente domo per noctem huc illuc cursaret incustoditus$$ It was said that Subrius Flavus had formed a sudden resolution to attack Nero when singing on the stage ,  or when his house was in flames and he was running hither and thither ,  unattended ,  in the darkness
 hic occasio solitudinis , ibi ipsa frequentia tanti decoris testis pulcherrima animum exstimulaverunt , nisi impunitatis cupido retinuisset , magnis semper conatibus adversa$$ In the one case was the opportunity of solitude in the other ,  the very crowd which would witness so glorious a deed ,  had roused a singularly noble soul
 Interim cunctantibus prolatantibusque spem ac metum Epicharis quaedam , incertum quonam modo sciscitata (neque illi ante ulla rerum honestarum cura fuerat) , accendere et arguere coniuratos$$ Meanwhile ,  as they hesitated in prolonged suspense between hope and fear ,  a certain Epicharis (how she informed herself is uncertain ,  as she had never before had a thought of anything noble) began to stir and upbraid the conspirators
 ac postremum lentitudinis eorum pertaesa et in Campania agens primores classiariorum Misenensium labefacere et conscientia inligare conisa est tali initio$$ Wearied at last of their long delay ,  she endeavoured ,  when staying in Campania ,  to shake the loyalty of the officers of the fleet at Misenum ,  and to entangle them in a guilty complicity
 erat nauarchus in ea classe Volusius Proculus , occidendae matris Neroni inter ministros , non ex magnitudine sceleris provectus , ut rebatur$$ She began thus There was a captain in the fleet ,  Volusius Proculus ,  who had been one of Nero's instruments in his mother's murder ,  and had not ,  as he thought ,  been promoted in proportion to the greatness of his crime
 is mulieri olim cognitus , seu recens orta amicitia , dum merita erga Neronem sua et quam in inritum cecidissent aperit adicitque questus et destinationem vindictae , si facultas oreretur , spem dedit posse impelli et plures conciliare$$ Either ,  as an old acquaintance of the woman ,  or on the strength of a recent intimacy ,  he divulged to her his services to Nero and their barren result to himself ,  adding complaints ,  and his determination to have vengeance ,  should the chance arise
 nec leve auxilium in classe , crebras occasiones , quia Nero multo apud Puteolos et Misenum maris usu laetabatur$$ He thus inspired the hope that he could be persuaded ,  and could secure many others
 ergo Epicharis plura et omnia scelera principis orditur , neque sancti quidquam manere$$ No small help was to be found in the fleet ,  and there would be numerous opportunities ,  as Nero delighted in frequent enjoyment of the sea off Puteoli and Misenum
 sed provisum , quonam modo poenas eversae rei publicae daret$$ Epicharis accordingly said more ,  and began the history of all the emperor's crimes
 accingeretur modo navare operam et militum acerrimos ducere in partes , ac digna pretia exspectaret$$ The Senate ,  she affirmed ,  had no power left it
 nomina tamen coniuratorum reticuit$$ yet means had been provided whereby he might pay the penalty of having destroyed the State
 unde Proculi indicium inritum fuit , quamvis ea , quae audierat , ad Neronem detulisset$$ Only let Proculus gird himself to do his part and bring over to their side his bravest soldiers ,  and then look for an adequate recompense
 accita quippe Epicharis et cum indice composita nullis testibus innisum facile confutavit$$ The conspirators' names ,  however ,  she withheld
 sed ipsa in custodia retenta est , suspectante Nerone haud falsa esse etiam quae vera non probabantur$$ Consequently the information of Proculus was useless ,  even though he reported what he had heard to Nero
 Igitur coepta luce Milichus in hortos Servilianos pergit et cum foribus arceretur , magna et atrocia adferre dictitans deductusque ab ianitoribus ad libertum Neronis Epaphroditum , mox ab eo ad Neronem , urgens periculum , graves coniuratos et cetera , quae audiverat coniectaverat , docet telum quoque in necem eius paratum ostendit accirique reum iussit$$ Accordingly at daybreak Milichus went to the Servilian gardens ,  and ,  finding the doors shut against him ,  said again and again that he was the bearer of important and alarming news Upon this he was conducted by the gatekeepers to one of Nero's freedmen ,  Epaphroditus ,  and by him to Nero ,  whom he informed of the urgent danger ,  of the formidable conspiracy ,  and of all else which he had heard or inferred
 is raptus per milites et defensionem orsus , ferrum , cuius argueretur , olim religione patria cultum et in cubiculo habitum ac fraude liberti subreptum respondit tabulas testamenti saepius a se et incustodia dierum observatione signatas pecunias et libertates servis et ante dono datas , sed ideo tunc largius , quia tenui iam re familiari et instantibus creditoribus testamento diffideret enimvero liberales semper epulas struxisse , dum ageret vitam amoenam et duris iudicibus parum probatam fomenta vulneribus nulla iussu suo , sed quia cetera palam vana obiecisset , adiungere crimen , cuius se pariter indicem et testem faceret$$ He showed him too the weapon prepared for his destruction ,  and bade him summon the accused Scaevinus on being arrested by the soldiers began his defence with the reply that the dagger about which he was accused ,  had of old been regarded with a religious sentiment by his ancestors ,  that it had been kept in his chamber ,  and been stolen by a trick of his freedman He had often ,  he said ,  signed his will without heeding the observance of particular days ,  and had previously given presents of money as well as freedom to some of his slaves ,  only on this occasion he gave more freely ,  because ,  as his means were now impoverished and his creditors were pressing him ,  he distrusted the validity of his will
 adicit dictis constantiam incusat ultro intestabilem et consceleratum , tanta vocis ac vultus securitate , ut labaret indicium , nisi Milichum uxor admonuisset Antonium Natalem multa cum Scaevino ac secreta collocutum et esse utrosque Gaius Pisonis intimos$$ Certainly his table had always been profusely furnished ,  and his life luxurious ,  such as rigid censors would hardly approve As to the bandages for wounds ,  none had been prepared at his order ,  but as all the man's other charges were absurd ,  he added an accusation in which he might make himself alike informer and witness
 Ergo accitur Natalis , et diversi interrogantur , quisnam is sermo , qua de re fuisset tum exorta suspicio , quia non congruentia responderant , inditaque vincla et tormentorum adspectum ac minas non tulere$$ He backed up his words by an air of resolution Turning on his accuser ,  he denounced him as an infamous and depraved wretch ,  with so fearless a voice and look that the information was beginning to collapse ,  when Milichus was reminded by his wife that Antonious Natalis had had a long secret conversation with Scaevinus ,  and that both were Piso's intimate friends
 prior tamen Natalis , totius conspirationis magis gnarus , simul arguendi peritior , de Pisone primum fatetur , deinde adicit Annaeum Senecam , sive internuntius inter eum Pisonemque fuit , sive ut Neronis gratiam pararet , qui infensus Senecae omnes ad eum opprimendum artes conquirebat tum cognito Natalis indicio Scaevinus quoque pari imbecillitate , an cuncta iam patefacta credens nec ullum silentii emolumentum , edidit ceteros ex quibus Lucanus Quintianusque et Senecio diu abnuere$$ Natalis was therefore summoned ,  and they were separately asked what the conversation was ,  and what was its subject Then a suspicion arose because their answers did not agree ,  and they were both put in irons They could not endure the sight and the threat of torture Natalis however ,  taking the initiative ,  knowing as he did more of the whole conspiracy ,  and being also more practised in accusing ,  first confessed about Piso ,  next added the name of Annaeus Seneca ,  either as having been a messenger between him and Piso ,  or to win the favour of Nero ,  who hated Seneca and sought every means for his ruin Then Scaevinus too ,  when he knew the disclosure of Natalis ,  with like pusillanimity ,  or under the impression that everything now divulged ,  and that there could be no advantage in silence ,  revealed the other conspirators
 post promissa impunitate corrupti , quo tarditatem excusarent , Lucanus Aciliam matrem suam , Quintianus Glitium Gallum , Senecio Annium Pollionem , amicorum praecipuos , nominavere$$ Of these ,  Lucanus ,  Quintianus ,  and Senecio long persisted in denial after a time ,  when bribed by the promise of impunity ,  anxious to excuse their reluctance ,  Lucanus named his mother Atilla ,  Quintianus and Senecio ,  their chief friends ,  respectively ,  Glitius Gallus and Annius Pollio
 Atque interim Nero recordatus Volusii Proculi indico Epicharin attineri ratusque muliebre corpus impar dolori tormentis dilacerari iubet$$ Nero ,  meanwhile ,  remembering that Epicharis was in custody on the information of Volusius Proculus ,  and assuming that a woman's frame must be unequal to the agony ,  ordered her to be torn on the rack
 at illam non verbera , non ignes , non ira eo acrius torquentium , ne a femina spernerentur , pervicere , quin obiecta denegaret$$ But neither the scourge nor fire ,  nor the fury of the men as they increased the torture that they might not be a woman's scorn ,  overcame her positive denial of the charge
 sic primus quaestionis dies contemptus$$ Thus the first day's inquiry was futile
 postero cum ad eosdem cruciatus retraheretur gestamine sellae (nam dissolutis membris insistere nequibat) , vinclo fasciae , quam pectori detraxerat , in modum laquei ad arcum sellae restricto indidit cervicem et corporis pondere conisa tenuem iam spiritum expressit , clariore exemplo libertina mulier in tanta necessitate alienos ac prope ignotos protegendo , cum ingenui et viri et equites Romani senatoresque intacti tormentis carissima suorum quisque pignorum proderent$$ On the morrow ,  as she was being dragged back on a chair to the same torments (for with her limbs all dislocated she could not stand) ,  she tied a band ,  which she had stript off her bosom ,  in a sort of noose to the arched back of the chair ,  put her neck in it ,  and then straining with the whole weight of her body ,  wrung out of her frame its little remaining breath All the nobler was the example set by a freedwoman at such a crisis in screening strangers and those whom she hardly knew ,  when freeborn men ,  Roman knights ,  and senators ,  yet unscathed by torture ,  betrayed ,  every one ,  his dearest kinsfolk For even Lucanus and Senecio and Quintianus failed not to reveal their accomplices indiscriminately ,  and Nero was more and more alarmed ,  though he had fenced his person with a largely augmented guard
 Non enim omittebant Lucanus quoque et Senecio et Quintianus passim conscios edere , magis magisque pavido Nerone , quamquam multiplicatis excubiis semet saepsisset$$ Even Rome itself he put ,  so to say ,  under custody ,  garrisoning its walls with companies of soldiers and occupying with troops the coast and the river-banks
 quin et urbem per manipulos occupatis moenibus , insesso etiam mari et amne , velut in custodiam dedit volitabantque per fora , per domos , rura quoque et proxima municipiorum pedites equitesque , permixti Germanis , quibus fidebat princeps quasi externis$$ Incessantly were there flying through the public places ,  through private houses ,  country fields ,  and the neighbouring villages ,  horse and foot soldiers ,  mixed with Germans ,  whom the emperor trusted as being foreigners In long succession ,  troops of prisoners in chains were dragged along and stood at the gates of his gardens
 continua hinc et vincta agmina trahi ac foribus hortorum adiacere atque ubi dicendam ad causam introissent , non studia tantum erga coniuratos , sed fortuitus sermo et subiti occursus , si convivium , si spectaculum simul inissent , pro crimine accipi , cum super Neronis ac Tigellini saevas percunctationes Faenius quoque Rufus violenter urgueret , nondum ab indicibus nominatus et quo fidem inscitiae pararet , atrox adversus socios$$ When they entered to plead their cause ,  a smile of joy on any of the conspirators ,  a casual conversation ,  a sudden meeting ,  or the fact of having entered a banquet or a public show in company ,  was construed into a crime ,  while to the savage questionings of Nero and Tigellinus were added the violent menaces of Faenius Rufus ,  who had not yet been named by the informers ,  but who ,  to get the credit of complete ignorance ,  frowned fiercely on his accomplices
 idem Subrio Flavo adsistenti adnuentique , an inter ipsam cognitionem destringeret gladium caedemque patraret , renuit infregitque impetum iam manum ad capulum referentis$$ When Subius Flavus at his side asked him by a sign whether he should draw his sword in the middle of the trial and perpetrate the fatal deed ,  Rufus refused ,  and checked the man's impulse as he was putting his hand to his sword-hilt
 Fuere qui prodita coniuratione , dum auditur Milichus , dum dubitat Scaevinus , hortarentur Pisonem pergere in castra aut rostra escendere studiaque militum et populi temptare$$ Some there were who ,  as soon as the conspiracy was betrayed ,  urged Piso ,  while Milichus' story was being heard ,  and Scaevinus was hesitating ,  to go to the camp or mount the Rostra and test the feelings of the soldiers and of the people
 si conatibus eius conscii adgregarentur , secuturos etiam integros magnamque motae rei famam , quae plurimum in novis consiliis valeret$$ If ,  said they ,  your accomplices join your enterprise ,  those also who are yet undecided ,  will follow ,  and great will be the fame of the movement once started ,  and this in any new scheme is all-powerful
 nihil adversum haec Neroni provisum$$ Against it Nero has taken no precaution
 etaim fortes viros subitis terreri , nedum ille scaenicus , Tigellino scilicet cum paelicibus suis comitante , arma contra cieret$$ Even brave men are dismayed by sudden perils far less will that stageplayer ,  with Tigellinus forsooth and his concubines in his train ,  raise arms against you
 multa experiendo confieri , quae segnibus ardua videantur$$ Many things are accomplished on trial which cowards think arduous
 frustra silentium et fidem in tot consciorum animis et corporibus sperare$$ It is vain to expect secrecy and fidelity from the varying tempers and bodily constitutions of such a host of accomplices
 cruciatui aut praemio cuncta pervia esse$$ Torture or reward can overcome everything
 venturos qui ipsum quoque vincirent , postremo indigna nece adficerent$$ Men will soon come to put you also in chains and inflict on you an ignominious death
 quanto laudabilius periturum , dum amplectitur rem publicam , dum auxilia libertati invocat! miles potius deesset et plebes desereret , dum ipse maioribus , dum posteris , si vita praeriperetur , mortem adprobaret$$ How much more gloriously will you die while you cling to the State and invoke aid for liberty Rather let the soldiers fail ,  the people be traitors ,  provided that you ,  if prematurely robbed of life ,  justify your death to your ancestors and descendants
 immotus his et paululum in publico versatus , post domi secretus animum adversum suprema firmabat , donec manus militum adveniret , quos Nero tirones aut stipendiis recentes delegerat nam vetus miles timebatur tamquam favore imbutus$$ Unmoved by these considerations ,  Piso showed himself a few moments in public ,  then sought the retirement of his house ,  and there fortified his spirit against the worst ,  till a troop of soldiers arrived ,  raw recruits ,  or men recently enlisted ,  whom Nero had selected ,  because he was afraid of the veterans ,  imbued ,  though they were ,  with a liking for him
 obiit abruptis brachiorum venis$$ Piso expired by having the veins in his arms severed
 testamentum foedis adversus Neronem adulationibus amori uxoris dedit , quam degenerem et sola corporis forma commendatam amici matrimonio abstulerat$$ His will ,  full of loathsome flatteries of Nero ,  was a concession to his love of his wife ,  a base woman ,  with only a beautiful person to recommend her ,  whom he had taken away from her husband ,  one of his friends
 nomen mulieri Satria Galla , priori marito Domitius Silus$$ Her name was Atria Galla
 hic patientia , illa impudica Pisonis infamiam propagavere$$ that of her former husband ,  Domitius Silus
 Proximam necem Plautii Laterani consulis designati Nero adiungit , adeo propere , ut non complect liberos , non illud breve mortis arbitrium permitteret$$ In quick succession Nero added the murder of Plautius Lateranus ,  consul-elect ,  so promptly that he did not allow him to embrace his children or to have the brief choice of his own death
 raptus in locum servilibus poenis sepositum manu Statii tribuni trucidatur , plenus constantis silentii nec tribuno obiciens eandem conscientiam$$ He was dragged off to a place set apart for the execution of slaves ,  and butchered by the hand of the tribune Statius ,  maintaining a resolute silence ,  and not reproaching the tribune with complicity in the plot
 Sequitur caedes Annaei Senecae , laetissima principi , non quia coniurationis manifestum compererat , sed ut ferro grassaretur , quando venenum non processerat$$ Then followed the destruction of Annaeus Seneca ,  a special joy to the emperor ,  not because he had convicted him of the conspiracy ,  but anxious to accomplish with the sword what poison had failed to do
 solus quippe Natalis et hactenus prompsit , missum se ad aegrotum Senecam , uti viseret conquerereturque , cur Pisonem aditu arceret melius fore , si amicitiam familiari congressu exercuissent$$ It was ,  in fact ,  Natalis alone who divulged Seneca's name ,  to this extent ,  that he had been sent to Seneca when ailing ,  to see him and remonstrate with him for excluding Piso from his presence ,  when it would have been better to have kept up their friendship by familiar intercourse
 et respondisse Senecam sermone mutuos et crebra conloquia neutri conducere$$ that Seneca's reply was that mutual conversations and frequent interviews were to the advantage of neither ,  but still that his own life depended on Piso's safety
 ceterum salutem suam incolumitate Pisonis inniti haec ferre Gavius Silvanus tribunus praetoriae cohortis , et an dicta Natalis suaque responsa nosceret percunctari Senecam iubetur$$ Gavius Silvanus ,  tribune of a praetorian cohort ,  was ordered to report this to Seneca and to ask him whether he acknowledged what Natalis said and his own answer
 is forte an prudens ad eum diem ex Campania remeaverat quartumque apud lapidem suburbano rure substiterat$$ Either by chance or purposely Seneca had returned on that day from Campania ,  and had stopped at a countryhouse four miles from Rome
 illo propinqua vespera tribunus venit et villam globis militum saepsit tum ipsi cum Pompeia Paulina uxore et amicis duobus epulanti mandata imperatoris edidit$$ Thither the tribune came next evening ,  surrounded the house with troops of soldiers ,  and then made known the emperor's message to Seneca as he was at dinner with his wife ,  Pompeia Paulina ,  and two friends
 Seneca missum ad se Natalem conquestumque nomine Pisonis , quod a visendo eo prohiberetur , seque rationem valetudinis et amorem quietis excusavisse respondit$$ Seneca replied that Natalis had been sent to him and had complained to him in Piso's name because of his refusal to see Piso ,  upon which he excused himself on the ground of failing health and the desire of rest
 cur salutem privati hominis incolumitati suae anteferret , causam non habuisse$$ He had no reason ,  he said ,  for preferring the interest of any private citizen to his own safety ,  and he had no natural aptitude for flattery
 nec sibi promptum in adulationes ingenium$$ No one knew this better than Nero ,  who had oftener experienced Seneca's freespokenness than his servility
 idque nulli magis gnarum quam Neroni , qui saepius libertatem Senecae quam servitium expertus esset$$ When the tribune reported this answer in the presence of Poppaea and Tigellinus ,  the emperor's most confidential advisers in his moments of rage ,  he asked whether Seneca was meditating suicide
 ubi haec a tribuno relata sunit Poppaea et Tigellino coram , quod erat saevienti principi intimum consiliorum , interrogat an Seneca voluntariam mortem pararet$$ Upon this the tribune asserted that he saw no signs of fear ,  and perceived no sadness in his words or in his looks He was accordingly ordered to go back and to announce sentence of death
 tum tribunus nulla pavoris signa , nihil triste in verbis eius aut vultu deprensum confirmavit ergo regredi et indicere mortem iubetur tradit Fabius Rusticus non eo quo venerat intinere redisse tribunum , sed flexisse ad Faenium praefectum et expositis Caesaris iussis an obtemperaret interrogavisse , monitumque ab eo ut exsequeretur , fatali omnium ignavia$$ Fabius Rusticus tells us that he did not return the way he came ,  but went out of his course to Faenius ,  the commander of the guard ,  and having explained to him the emperor's orders ,  and asked whether he was to obey them ,  was by him admonished to carry them out ,  for a fatal spell of cowardice was on them all For this very Silvanus was one of the conspirators ,  and he was now abetting the crimes which he had united with them to avenge
 nam et Silvanus inter coniuratos erat augebatque scelera , in quorum ultionem consenserat$$ But he spared himself the anguish of a word or of a look ,  and merely sent in to Seneca one of his centurions ,  who was to announce to him his last doom
 Ubi haec atque talia velut in commune disseruit , complectitur uxorem , et paululum adversus praesentem fortitudinem mollitus rogat oratque temperaret dolori neu aeternum susciperet , sed in contemplatione vitae per virtutem actae desiderium mariti solaciis honestis toleraret$$ Having spoken these and like words ,  meant ,  so to say ,  for all ,  he embraced his wife then softening awhile from the stern resolution of the hour ,  he begged and implored her to spare herself the burden of perpetual sorrow ,  and ,  in the contemplation of a life virtuously spent ,  to endure a husband's loss with honourable consolations
 illa contra sibi quoque destinatam mortem adseverat manumque percussoris exposcit$$ She declared ,  in answer ,  that she too had decided to die ,  and claimed for herself the blow of the executioner
 tum Seneca gloriae eius non adversus , simul amore , ne sibi unice dilectam ad iniurias relinqueret , vitae inquit delenimenta monstraveram tibi , tu mortis decus mavis$$ There upon Seneca ,  not to thwart her noble ambition ,  from an affection too which would not leave behind him for insult one whom he dearly loved ,  replied 
 non invidebo exemplo$$  I have shown you ways of smoothing life
 sit huius tam fortis exitus constantia penes utrosque par , claritudinis plus in tuo fine$$ you prefer the glory of dying I will not grudge you such a noble example
 post quae eodem ictu brachia ferro exsolvunt$$ Let the fortitude of so courageous an end be alike in both of us ,  but let there be more in your decease to win fame
 Seneca , quoniam senile corpus et parco victu tenuatum lenta effugia sanguini praebebat , crurum quoque et poplitum venas abrumpit$$ Then by one and the same stroke they sundered with a dagger the arteries of their arms Seneca ,  as his aged frame ,  attenuated by frugal diet ,  allowed the blood to escape but slowly ,  severed also the veins of his legs and knees
 saevisque cruciatibus defessus , ne dolore suo animum uxoris infringeret atque ipse visendo eius tormenta ad impatientiam delaberetur , suadet in aliud cubiculum abscedere$$ Worn out by cruel anguish ,  afraid too that his sufferings might break his wife's spirit ,  and that ,  as he looked on her tortures ,  he might himself sink into irresolution ,  he persuaded her to retire into another chamber
 et novissimo quoque momento suppeditante eloquentia advocatis scriptoribus pleraque tradidit , quae in vulgus edita eius verbis invertere supersedeo$$ Even at the last moment his eloquence failed him not he summoned his secretaries ,  and dictated much to them which ,  as it has been published for all readers in his own words ,  I forbear to paraphrase
 Fama fuit Subrium Flavum cum centurionibus occulto consilio , neque tamen ignorante Seneca , destinavisse , ut post occisum opera Pisonis Neronem Piso quoque interficeretur tradereturque imperium Senecae , quasi insonti et claritudine virtutum ad summum fastigium delecto$$ There was a rumour that Sabrius Flavus had held a secret consultation with the centurions ,  and had planned ,  not without Seneca's knowledge ,  that when Nero had been slain by Piso's instrumentality ,  Piso also was to be murdered ,  and the empire handed over to Seneca ,  as a man singled out for his splendid virtues by all persons of integrity
 quin et verba Flavi vulgabantur , non referre dedecori , si citharoedus demoveretur et tragoedus succederet (quia ut Nero cithara , ita Piso tragico ornatu canebat)$$ Even a saying of Flavus was popularly current ,  that it mattered not as to the disgrace if a harp-player were removed and a tragic actor succeeded him For as Nero used to sing to the harp ,  so did Piso in the dress of a tragedian
 Ceterum militaris quoque conspiratio non ultra fefellit , accensis quoque indicibus ad prodendum Faenium Rufum , quem eundem conscium et inquisitorem non tolerabant$$ The soldiers' part too in the conspiracy no longer escaped discovery ,  some in their rage becoming informers to betray Faenius Rufus ,  whom they could not endure to be both an accomplice and a judge
 ergo instanti minitantique renidens Scaevinus neminem ait plura scire quam ipsum , hortaturque ultro redderet tam bono principi vicem$$ Accordingly Scaevinus ,  in answer to his browbeating and menaces ,  said with a smile that no one knew more than he did ,  and actually urged him to show gratitude to so good a prince
 non vox adversum ea Faenio , non silentium , sed verba sua praepediens et pavoris manifestus , ceterisque ac maxime Cervario Proculo equite Romano ad convincendum eum conisis , iussu imperatoris a Cassio milite , qui ob insigne corporis robur adstabat , corripitur vinciturque$$ Faenius could not meet this with either speech or silence Halting in his words and visibly terror-stricken ,  while the rest ,  especially Cervarius Proculus ,  a Roman knight ,  did their utmost to convict him ,  he was ,  at the emperor's bidding ,  seized and bound by Cassius ,  a soldier ,  who because of his well-known strength of limb was in attendance
 Mox eorundem indicio Subrius Flavus tribunus pervertitur , primo dissimilitudinem morum ad defensionem trahens , neque se armatum cum inermibus et effeminatis tantum facinus consociaturum$$ Shortly afterwards ,  the information of the same men proved fatal to Subrius Flavus At first he grounded his defence on his moral contrast to the others ,  implying that an armed soldier ,  like himself ,  would never have shared such an attempt with unarmed and effeminate associates
 dein , postquam urgebatur , confessionis gloriam amplexus interrogatusque a Nerone , quibus causis ad oblivionem sacramenti processisset , oderam te , inquit$$ Then ,  when he was pressed ,  he embraced the glory of a full confession Questioned by Nero as to the motives which had led him on to forget his oath of allegiance ,  I hated you ,  he replied
 nec quisquam tibi fidelior militum fuit , dum amari meruisti$$ yet not a soldier was more loyal to you while you deserved to be loved
 odisse coepi , postquam parricida matris et uxoris , auriga et histrio et incendiarius extitisti$$ I began to hate you when you became the murderer of your mother and your wife ,  a charioteer ,  an actor ,  and an incendiary
 ipsa rettuli verba , quia non , ut Senecae , vulgata erant , nec minus nosci decebat militaris viri sensus incomptos et validos$$ I have given the man's very words ,  because they were not ,  like those of Seneca ,  generally published ,  though the rough and vigorous sentiments of a soldier ought to be no less known
 nihil in illa coniuratione gravius auribus Neronis accidisse constitit , qui ut faciendis sceleribus promptus , ita audiendi quae faceret insolens erat$$ Throughout the conspiracy nothing ,  it was certain ,  fell with more terror on the ears of Nero ,  who was as unused to be told of the crimes he perpetrated as he was eager in their perpetration

 simul annuam pecuniam a Publius Anteio ministrari cognoscit$$ He thought there must be a meaning in the frequent messages and the consultations ,  and he learnt at the same time that an annual payment was furnished him by Publius Anteius

 quae composita credebantur de Crispino , quia interfectus erat , de Ceriale , ut interficeretur$$ It was thought that he had invented this about Crispinus ,  because the man had been already murdered

 Contra qui opperiendum domi censebant , de ipso Thrasea eadem , sed ludibria et contumelias imminere$$ Those ,  on the other hand ,  who thought that he ought to wait at home ,  though their opinion of him was the same ,  hinted that mockeries and insults were in store for him

 ut Neronem flagitiorum pudor caperet inrita spe agitari multoque magis timendum ne in coniugem , in filiam , in cetera pignora eius saeviret$$ It is with a vain hope we are aiming to touch Nero with shame for his abominations ,  and we have far more cause to fear that he will vent his fury on your wife ,  your household ,  on all others dear to you

 nemine nominatim compellato patres arguebat quod publica munia desererent eorumque exemplo equites Romani ad segnitiam verterentur$$ Without addressing any one by name ,  he censured the senators for neglecting their public duties ,  and drawing by their example the Roman knights into idleness
 etenim quid mirum e longinquis provinciis haud veniri , cum plerique adepti consulatum et sacerdotia hortorum potius amoenitati inservirent$$ For what wonder is it ,  he asked ,  that men do not come from remote provinces when many ,  after obtaining the consulate or some sacred office ,  give all their thoughts by choice to the beauty of their gardens

 contumacia inferiorum lenitatem imperitantis deminui$$ It is ,  he said ,  the stubbornness of inferiors which lessens the clemency of our ruler
 nimium mitis ad eam diem patres , qui Thraseam desciscentem , qui generum eius Helvidium Priscum in isdem furoribus , simul Paconium Agrippinum , paterni in principes odii heredem , et Curtium Montanum detestanda carmina factitantem eludere impune sinerent$$ We senators have hitherto been too lenient in allowing him to be mocked with impunity by Thrasea throwing off allegiance ,  by his son-in-law Helvidius Priscus indulging similar frenzies ,  by Paconius Agrippinus ,  the inheritor of his father's hatred towards emperors ,  and by Curtius Montanus ,  the habitual composer of abominable verses
 requirere se in senatu consularem , in votis sacerdotem , in iure iurando civem , nisi contra instituta et caerimonias maiorum proditorem palam et hostem Thrasea induisset$$ I miss the presence of an ex-consul in the Senate ,  of a priest when we offer our vows ,  of a citizen when we swear obedience ,  unless indeed ,  in defiance of the manners and rites of our ancestors ,  Thrasea has openly assumed the part of a traitor and an enemy
 denique agere senatorem et principis obtrectatores protegere solitus veniret , censeret quid corrigi aut mutari vellet$$ In a word ,  let the man ,  wont to act the senator and to screen those who disparage the prince ,  come among us
 facilius perlaturos singula increpantem quam nunc silentium perferrent omnia damnantis$$ let him propose any reform or change he may desire
 pacem illi per orbem terrae , an victorias sine damno exercituum displicere$$ We shall more readily endure his censure of details than we can now bear the silence by which he condemns everything

 abrumperet vitam ab ea civitate cuius caritatem olim , nunc et aspectum exuisset$$ To him the decrees of this house ,  the offices of State ,  the city of Rome seem as nothing
 Cum per haec atque talia Marcellus , ut erat torvus ac minax , voce vultu oculis ardesceret , non illa nota et celebritate periculorum sueta iam senatus maestitia , sed novus et altior pavor manus et tela militum cernentibus$$ While Marcellus ,  with the savage and menacing look he usually wore ,  spoke these and like words with rising fury in his voice ,  countenance ,  and eye ,  that familiar grief to which a thick succession of perils had habituated the Senate gave way to a new and profounder panic ,  as they saw the soldiers' hands on their weapons
 simul ipsius Thraseae venerabilis species obversabatur et erant qui Helvidium quoque miserarentur , innoxiae adfinitatis poenas daturum$$ At the same moment the venerable form of Thrasea rose before their imagination ,  and some there were who pitied Helvidius too ,  doomed as he was to suffer for an innocent alliance
 quid Agrippino obiectum nisi tristem patris fortunam , quando et ille perinde innocens Tiberii saevitia concidisset$$ What again ,  they asked ,  was the charge against Agrippinus except his father's sad fate ,  since he too ,  though guiltless as his son ,  fell beneath the cruelty of Tiberius

 Atque interim Ostorius Sabinus , Sorani accusator , ingreditur orditurque de amicitia Rubelli Plauti , quodque proconsulatum Asiae Soranus pro claritate sibi potius accommodatum quam ex utilitate communi egisset , alendo seditiones civitatium$$ And meanwhile Ostorius Sabinus ,  the accuser of Soranus ,  entered ,  and began by speaking of his friendship with Rubellius Plautus and of his proconsulate in Asia which he had ,  he said ,  adapted to his own glory rather than to the public welfare ,  by fostering seditious movements in the various states
 vetera haec sed recens et quo discrimini patris filiatn conectebat , quod pecuniam magis dilargita esset$$ These were bygones ,  but there was a fresh charge involving the daughter in the peril of the father ,  to the effect that she had lavished money on astrologers
 acciderat sane pietate Serviliae (id enim nomen puellae fuit) , quae caritate erga parentem , simul imprudentia aetatis , non tamen aliud consultaverat quam de incolumitate domus , et an placabilis Nero , an cognitio senatus nihil atrox adferret$$ This indeed had really occurred through the filial affection of Servilia (that was the girl's name) ,  who ,  out of love for her father and the thoughtlessness of youth ,  had consulted them ,  only however about the safety of her family ,  whether Nero could be appeased ,  and the trial before the Senate have no dreadful result
 igitur accita est in senatum , steteruntque diversi ante tribunal consulum grandis aevo parens , contra filia intra vicesimum aetatis annum , nuper marito Annio Pollione in exilium pulso viduata desolataque , ac ne patrem quidem intuens cuius onerasse pericula videbatur$$ She was accordingly summoned before the Senate ,  and there they stood facing one another before the consuls' tribunal ,  the aged parent ,  and opposite to him the daughter ,  in the twentieth year of her age ,  widowed and forlorn ,  her husband Annius Pollio having lately been driven into banishment ,  without so much as a glance at her father ,  whose peril she seemed to have aggravated
 Tum interrogante accusatore an cultus dotalis , an detractum cervici monile venum dedisset , quo pecuniam faciendis magicis sacris contraheret , primum strata humi longoque fletu et silentio , post altaria et aram complexa nullos inquit impios deos , nullas devotiones , nec aliud infelicibus precibus invocavi quam ut hunc optimum patrem tu , Caesar , vos , patres , servaretis incolumem$$ Then on the accuser asking her whether she had sold her bridal presents or stript her neck of its ornaments to raise money for the performance of magical rites ,  she at first flung herself on the ground and wept long in silence After awhile ,  clasping the altar steps and altar ,  she exclaimed ,  I have invoked no impious deities ,  no enchantments ,  nor aught else in my unhappy prayers ,  but only that thou ,  Caesar ,  and you ,  senators ,  might preserve unharmed this best of fathers
 sic gemmas et vestis et dignitatis insignia dedi , quo modo si sanguinems et vitam poposcissent$$ My jewels ,  my apparel ,  and the signs of my rank I gave up ,  as I would have given up my life-blood had they demanded it

 nulla mihi principis mentio nisi inter numina fuit$$ No mention was made by me of the emperor ,  except as one of the divinities
 nescit tamen miserrimus pater et , si crimen est , sola deliqui$$ But my most unhappy father knows nothing ,  and ,  if it is a crime ,  I alone am guilty
 Loquentis adhuc verba excipit Soranus proclamatque non illam in provinciam secum profectam , non Plauto per aetatem nosci potuisse , non criminibus mariti conexam$$ While she was yet speaking ,  Soranus caught up her words ,  and exclaimed that she had not gone with him into the province that ,  from her youth ,  she could not have been known to Plautus ,  and that she was not involved in the charges against her husband
 nimiae tantum pietatis ream separarent , atque ipse quamcumque sortem subiret$$ Treat separately ,  he said ,  the case of one who is guilty only of an exaggerated filial piety ,  and as for myself ,  let me undergo any fate
 simul in amplexus occurrentis filiae ruebat , nisi interiecti lictores utrisque obstitissent$$ He was rushing ,  as he spoke ,  into the embraces of his daughter who hurried towards him ,  but the lictors interposed and stopped them both
 mox datus testibus locus et quantum misericordiae saevitia accusationis permoverat , tantum irae Publius Egnatius testis concivit$$ Place was then given to the witnesses ,  and the appearance among them of Publius Egnatius provoked as much indignation as the cruelty of the prosecution had excited pity
 cliens hic Sorani et tunc emptus ad opprimendum amicum auctoritatem Stoicae sectae praeferebat , habitu et ore ad exprimendam imaginem honesti exercitus , ceterum animo perfidiosus , subdolus , avaritiam ac libidinem occultans$$ A client of Soranus ,  and now hired to ruin his friend ,  he professed the dignified character of a Stoic ,  and had trained himself in demeanour and language to exhibit an ideal of virtue In his heart ,  however ,  treacherous and cunning ,  he concealed greed and sensuality
 quae postquam pecunia reclusa sunt , dedit exemplum praecavendi , quo modo fraudibus involutos aut flagitiis commaculatos , sic specie bonarum artium falsos et amicitiae fallacis$$ As soon as money had brought these vices to light ,  he became an example ,  warning us to beware just as much of those who under the guise of virtuous tastes are false and deceitful in friendship ,  as of men wholly entangled in falsehoods and stained with every infamy
 Idem tamen dies et honestum exemplum tulit Cassii Asclepiodoti , qui magnitudine opum praecipuus inter Bithynos , quo obsequio florentem Soranum celebraverat , labantem non deseruit , exutusque omnibus fortunis et in exilium actus , aequitate deum erga bona malaque documenta$$ That same day brought with it a noble pattern in Cassius Asclepiodotus ,  whose vast wealth made him a foremost man in Bithynia He had honoured Soranus in his prosperity with a respect which he did not cast off in his fall ,  and he was now stript of all his property and driven into exile so impartially indifferent is heaven to examples of virtue and vice

 Tum ad Thraseam in hortis agentem quaestor consulis missus vesperascente iam die$$ Then ,  as evening approached ,  the consul's quaestor was sent to Thrasea ,  who was passing his time in his garden
 inlustrium virorum feminarumque coetus frequentis egerat , maxime intentus Demetrio Cynicae institutionis doctori , cum quo , ut coniectare erat intentione vultus et auditis , si qua clarius proloquebantur , de natura animae et dissociatione spiritus corporisque inquirebat , donec advenit Domitius Caecilianus ex intimis amicis et ei quid senatus censuisset exposuit$$ He had had a crowded gathering of distinguished men and women ,  giving special attention to Demetrius ,  a professor of the Cynic philosophy With him ,  as might be inferred from his earnest expression of face and from words heard when they raised their voices ,  he was speculating on the nature of the soul and on the separation of the spirit from the body ,  till Domitius Caecilianus ,  one of his intimate friends ,  came to him and told him in detail what the Senate had decided
 igitur flentis queritantisque qui aderant facessere propere Thrasea neu pericula sua miscere cum sorte damnati hortatur , Arriamque temptantem mariti suprema et exemplum Arriae matris sequi monet retinere vitam filiaeque communi subsidium unicum non adimere$$ When all who were present ,  wept and bitterly complained ,  Thrasea urged them to hasten their departure and not mingle their own perils with the fate of a doomed man Arria ,  too ,  who aspired to follow her husband's end and the example of Arria ,  her mother ,  he counselled to preserve her life ,  and not rob the daughter of their love of her only stay
 Tum progressus in porticum illic a quaestore reperitur , laetitiae propior , quia Helvidium generum suum Italia tantum arceri cognoverat$$ Then he went out into a colonnade ,  where he was found by the quaestor ,  joyful rather than otherwise ,  as he had learnt that Helvidius ,  his son-in-law ,  was merely excluded from Italy
 accepto dehinc senatus consulto Helvidium et Demetrium in cubiculum inducit porrectisque utriusque brachii venis , postquam cruorem effudit , humum super spargens , propius vocato quaestore libamus inquit Iovi liberatori specta , invenis$$ When he heard the Senate's decision ,  he led Helvidius and Demetrius into a chamber ,  and having laid bare the arteries of each arm ,  he let the blood flow freely ,  and ,  as he sprinkled it on the ground ,  he called the quaestor to his side and said ,  We pour out a libation to Jupiter the Deliverer
 et omen quidem dii prohibeant , ceterum in ea tempora natus es quibus firmare animum expediat constantibus exemplis$$ Behold ,  young man ,  and may the gods avert the omen ,  but you have been born into times in which it is well to fortify the spirit with examples of courage

 simul veritas pluribus modis infracta , primum inscitia rei publicae ut alienae , mox libidine adsentandi aut rursus odio adversus dominantis$$ Then too the truthfulness of history was impaired in many ways at first ,  through men's ignorance of public affairs ,  which were now wholly strange to them ,  then ,  through their passion for flattery ,  or ,  on the other hand ,  their hatred of their masters
 ita neutris cura posteritatis inter infensos vel obnoxios$$ And so between the enmity of the one and the servility of the other ,  neither had any regard for posterity
 sed ambitionem scriptoris facile averseris , obtrectatio et livor pronis auribus accipiuntur quippe adulationi foedum crimen servitutis , malignitati falsa species libertatis inest$$ But while we instinctively shrink from a writer's adulation ,  we lend a ready ear to detraction and spite ,  because flattery involves the shameful imputation of servility ,  whereas malignity wears the false appearance of honesty

 nec minus praemia delatorum invisa quam scelera , cum alii sacerdotia et consulatus ut spolia adepti , procurationes alii et interiorem potentiam , agerent verterent cuncta odio et terrore$$ Sacred rites were profaned there was profligacy in the highest ranks the sea was crowded with exiles ,  and its rocks polluted with bloody deeds In the capital there were yet worse horrors Nobility ,  wealth ,  the refusal or the acceptance of office ,  were grounds for accusation ,  and virtue ensured destruction
 corrupti in dominos servi , in patronos liberti$$ The rewards of the informers were no less odious than their crimes
 et quibus deerat inimicus per amicos oppressi$$ for while some seized on consulships and priestly offices ,  as their share of the spoil ,  others on procuratorships ,  and posts of more confidential authority ,  they robbed and ruined in every direction amid universal hatred and terror

 nec enim umquam atrocioribus populi Romani cladibus magisve iustis indiciis adprobatum est non esse curae deis securitatem nostram , esse ultionem$$ Never surely did more terrible calamities of the Roman People ,  or evidence more conclusive ,  prove that the Gods take no thought for our happiness ,  but only for our punishment
 Ceterum antequam destinata componam , repetendum videtur qualis status urbis , quae mens exercituum , quis habitus provinciarum , quid in toto terrarum orbe validum , quid aegrum fuerit , ut non modo casus eventusque rerum , qui plerumque fortuiti sunt , sed ratio etiam causaeque noscantur$$ I think it proper ,  however ,  before I commence my purposed work ,  to pass under review the condition of the capital ,  the temper of the armies ,  the attitude of the provinces ,  and the elements of weakness and strength which existed throughout the whole empire ,  that so we may become acquainted ,  not only with the vicissitudes and the issues of events ,  which are often matters of chance ,  but also with their relations and their causes
 finis Neronis ut laetus primo gaudentium impetu fuerat , ita varios motus animorum non modo in urbe apud patres aut populum aut urbanum militem , sed omnis legiones ducesque conciverat , evulgato imperii arcano posse principem alibi quam Romae fieri$$ Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy ,  yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome ,  among the Senators ,  the people ,  or the soldiery of the capital ,  it had also excited all the legions and their generals for now had been divulged that secret of the empire ,  that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome

 Miles urbanus longo Caesarum sacramento imbutus et ad destituendum Neronem arte magis et impulsu quam suo ingenio traductus , postquam neque dari donativum sub nomine Galbae promissum neque magnis meritis ac praemiis eundem in pace quem in bello locum praeventamque gratiam intellegit apud principem a legionibus factum , pronus ad novas res scelere insuper Nymphidii Sabini praefecti imperium sibi molientis agitatur$$ The soldiery of the capital ,  who were imbued with the spirit of an old allegiance to the Caesars ,  and who had been led to desert Nero by intrigues and influences from without rather than by their own feelings ,  were inclined for change ,  when they found that the donative promised in Galba's name was withheld ,  and reflected that for great services and great rewards there was not the same room in peace as in war ,  and that the favour of an emperor created by the legions must be already preoccupied They were further excited by the treason of Nymphidius Sabinus ,  their prefect ,  who himself aimed at the throne
 et Nymphidius quidem in ipso conatu oppressus , set quamvis capite defectionis ablato manebat plerisque militum conscientia , nec deerant sermones senium atque avaritiam Galbae increpantium$$ Nymphidius indeed perished in the attempt ,  but ,  though the head of the mutiny was thus removed ,  there yet remained in many of the soldiers the consciousness of guilt There were even men who talked in angry terms of the feebleness and avarice of Galba
 laudata olim et militari fama celebrata severitas eius angebat aspernantis veterem disciplinam atque ita quattuordecim annis a Nerone adsuefactos ut haud minus vitia principum amarent quam olim virtutes verebantur$$ The strictness once so commended ,  and celebrated in the praises of the army ,  was galling to troops who rebelled against the old discipline ,  and who had been accustomed by fourteen years' service under Nero to love the vices of their emperors ,  as much as they had once respected their virtues
 accessit Galbae vox pro re publica honesta , ipsi anceps , legi a se militem , non emi$$ To all this was added Galba's own expression ,  I choose my soldiers ,  I do not buy them ,  noble words for the commonwealth ,  but fraught with peril for himself

 introitus in urbem trucidatis tot milibus inermium militum infaustus omine atque ipsis etiam qui occiderant formidolosus$$ Both had perished without hearing or defence ,  like innocent men His entry into the capital ,  made after the slaughter of thousands of unarmed soldiers ,  was most ill-omened ,  and was terrible even to the executioners

 ingens novis rebus materia , ut non in unum aliquem prono favore ita audenti parata$$ Here there were vast materials for a revolution ,  without indeed a decided bias towards any one man ,  but ready to a daring hand
 Forte congruerat ut Clodii Macri et Fontei Capitonis caedes nuntiarentur$$ In this conjuncture it happened that tidings of the deaths of Fonteius Capito and Clodius Macer reached the capital
 Macrum in Africa haud dubie turbantem Trebonius Garutianus procurator iussu Galbae , Capitonem in Germania , cum similia coeptaret , Cornelius Aquinus et Fabius Valens legati legionum interfecerant antequam iuberentur$$ Macer was executed in Africa ,  where he was undoubtedly fomenting sedition ,  by Trebonius Garutianus the procurator ,  who acted on Galba's authority Capito fell in Germany ,  while he was making similar attempts ,  by the hands of Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens ,  legates of legions ,  who did not wait for an order
 fuere qui crederent Capitonem ut avaritia et libidine foedum ac maculosum ita cogitatione rerum novarum abstinuisse , sed a legatis bellum suadentibus , postquam impellere nequiverint , crimen ac dolum ultro compositum , et Galbam mobilitate ingenii , an ne altius scrutaretur , quoquo modo acta , quia mutari non poterant , comprobasse$$ There were however some who believed that Capito ,  though foully stained with avarice and profligacy ,  had yet abstained from all thought of revolution ,  that this was a treacherous accusation invented by the commanders themselves ,  who had urged him to take up arms ,  when they found themselves unable to prevail ,  and that Galba had approved of the deed ,  either from weakness of character ,  or to avoid investigation into the circumstances of acts which could not be altered
 ceterum utraque caedes sinistre accepta , et inviso semel principi seu bene seu male facta parem invidiam adferebant$$ Both executions ,  however ,  were unfavourably regarded indeed ,  when a ruler once becomes unpopular ,  all his acts ,  be they good or bad ,  tell against him
 venalia cuncta , praepotentes liberti , servorum manus subitis avidae et tamquamm apud senem festinantes , eademque novae aulae mala , aeque gravia , non aeque excusata$$ The freedmen in their excessive power were now putting up everything for sale the slaves caught with greedy hands at immediate gain ,  and ,  reflecting on their master's age ,  hastened to be rich
 ipsa aetas Galbae inrisui ac fastidio erat adsuetis iuventae Neronis et imperatores forma ac decore corporis , ut est mos vulgi , comparantibus$$ The new court had the same abuses as the old ,  abuses as grievous as ever ,  but not so readily excused Even the age of Galba caused ridicule and disgust among those whose associations were with the youth of Nero ,  and who were accustomed ,  as is the fashion of the vulgar ,  to value their emperors by the beauty and grace of their persons
 Et hic quidem Romae , tamquam in tanta multitudine , habitus animorum fuit$$ Such ,  as far as one can speak of so vast a multitude ,  was the state of feeling at Rome
 e provinciis Hispaniae praeerat Cluvius Rufus , vir facundus et pacis artibus , bellis inexpertus$$ Among the provinces ,  Spain was under the government of Cluvius Rufus ,  an eloquent man ,  who had all the accomplishments of civil life ,  but who was without experience in war

 Germanici exercitus , quod periculosissimum in tantis viribus , solliciti et irati , superbia recentis victoriae et metu tamquam alias partis fovissent$$ The armies of Germany were at once alarmed and angry ,  a most dangerous temper when allied with such strength while elated by their recent victory ,  they feared because they might seem to have supported an unsuccessful party
 tarde a Nerone desciverant , nec statim pro Galba Verginius$$ They had been slow to revolt from Nero ,  and Verginius had not immediately declared for Galba
 an imperare noluisset dubium delatum ei a milite imperium conveniebat$$ it was doubtful whether he had himself wished to be emperor ,  but all agreed that the empire had been offered to him by the soldiery
 Fonteium Capitonem occisum etiam qui queri non poterant , tamen indignabantur$$ Again ,  the execution of Capito was a subject of indignation ,  even with those who could not complain of its injustice
 dux deerat abducto Verginio per simulationem amicitiae$$ They had no leader ,  for Verginius had been withdrawn on the pretext of his friendship with the Emperor
 quem non remitti atque etiam reum esse tamquam suum crimen accipiebant$$ That he was not sent back ,  and that he was even impeached ,  they regarded as an accusation against themselves
 Aegyptum copiasque , quibus coerceretur , iam inde a divo Augusto equites Romani obtinent loco regum$$ Ever since the time of the Divine Augustus Roman Knights have ruled Egypt as kings ,  and the forces by which it has to be kept in subjection
 ita visum expedire , provinciam aditu difficilem , annonae fecundam , superstitione ac lascivia discordem et mobilem , insciam legum , ignaram magistratuum , domi retinere$$ It has been thought expedient thus to keep under home control a province so difficult of access ,  so productive of corn ,  ever distracted ,  excitable ,  and restless through the superstition and licentiousness of its inhabitants ,  knowing nothing of laws ,  and unused to civil rule

 hic fuit rerum Romanarum status , cum Servius Galba iterum Titus Vinius consules inchoavere annum sibi ultimum , rei publicae prope supremum$$ Such was the state of the Roman world ,  when Servius Galba ,  consul for the second time ,  with T Vinius for his colleague ,  entered upon a year ,  which was to be the last of their lives ,  and which well nigh brought the commonwealth to an end
 Paucis post kalendas Ianuarias diebus Pompei Propinqui procuratoris e Belgica litterae adferuntur , supeioris Germaniae legiones rupta sacramenti reverentia imperatorem alium flagitare et senatui ac populo Romano arbitrium eligendi permittere quo seditio mollius acciperetur$$ A few days after the 1st of January ,  there arrived from Belgica despatches of Pompeius Propinquus ,  the Procurator ,  to this effect that the legions of Upper Germany had broken through the obligation of their military oath ,  and were demanding another emperor ,  but conceded the power of choice to the Senate and people of Rome ,  in the hope that a more lenient view might be taken of their revolt
 maturavit ea res consilium Galbae iam pridem de adoptione secum et cum proximis agitantis$$ These tidings hastened the plans of Galba ,  who had been long debating the subject of adoption with himself and with his intimate friends
 non sane crebrior tota civitate sermo per illos mensis fuerat , primum licentia ac libidine talia loquendi , dein fessa iam aetate Galbae$$ There was indeed no more frequent subject of conversation during these months ,  at first because men had liberty and inclination to talk of such matters ,  afterwards because the feebleness of Galba was notorious
 paucis iudicium aut rei publicae amor multi stulta spe , prout quis amicus vel cliens , hunc vel illum ambitiosis rumoribus destinabant , etiam in Titi Vinii odium , qui in dies quanto potentior eodem actu invisior erat$$ Few had any discrimination or patriotism ,  many had foolish hopes for themselves ,  and spread interested reports ,  in which they named this or that person to whom they might be related as friend or dependant They were also moved by hatred of T Vinius ,  who grew daily more powerful ,  and in the same proportion more unpopular
 quippe hiantis in magna fortuna amicorum cupiditates ipsa Galbae facilitas intendebat , cum apud infirmum et credulum minore metu et maiore praemio peccaretur$$ The very easiness of Galba's temper stimulated the greedy cupidity which great advancement had excited in his friends ,  because with one so weak and so credulous wrong might be done with less risk and greater gain
 Potentia principatus divisa in Titum Vinium consulem Cornelium Laconem praetorii praefectum$$ The real power of the Empire was divided between T
 nec minor gratia Icelo Galbae liberto , quem anulis donatum equestri nomine Marcianum vocitabant$$ Vinius ,  the consul ,  and Cornelius Laco ,  prefect of the Praetorian Guard
 hi discordes et rebus minoribus sibi quisque tendentes , circa consilium eligendi successoris in duas factiones scindebantur$$ Icelus ,  a freedman of Galba ,  was in equal favour he had been presented with the rings of knighthood ,  and bore the Equestrian name of Martianus
 Vinius pro Marcus Othone , Laco atque Icelus consensu non tam unum aliquem fovebant quam alium$$ These men ,  being at variance ,  and in smaller matters pursuing their own aims ,  were divided in the affair of choosing a successor ,  into two opposing factions
 neque erat Galbae ignota Othonis ac Titi Vinii amicitia$$ T
 et rumoribus nihil silentio transmittentium , quia Vinio vidua filia , caelebs Otho , gener ac socer destinabantur$$ Vinius was for Marcus Otho ,  Laco and Icelus agreed ,  not indeed in supporting any particular individual ,  but in striving for some one else
 credo et rei publicae curam subisse , frustra a Nerone translatae si apud Othonem relinqueretur$$ Galba indeed was aware of the friendship between Vinius and Otho
 namque Otho pueritiam incuriose , adulescentiam petulanter egerat , gratus Neroni aemulatione luxus$$ the gossip of those who allow nothing to pass in silence had named them as father-in-law and son-in-law ,  for Vinius had a widowed daughter ,  and Otho was unmarried
 eoque Poppaeam Sabinam , principale scortum , ut apud conscium libidinum deposuerat , donec Octaviam uxorem amoliretur$$ I believe that he had also at heart some care for the commonwealth ,  in vain ,  he would think ,  rescued from Nero ,  if it was to be left with Otho
 mox suspectum in eadem Poppaea in provinciam Lusitaniam specie legationis seposuit$$ For Otho's had been a neglected boyhood and a riotous youth ,  and he had made himself agreeable to Nero by emulating his profligacy
 Otho comiter administrata provincia primus in partis transgressus nec segnis et , donec bellum fuit , inter praesentis splendidissimus , spem adoptionis statim conceptam acrius in dies rapiebat , faventibus plerisque militum , prona in eum aula Neronis ut similem$$ For this reason the Emperor had entrusted to him ,  as being the confidant of his amours ,  Poppaea Sabina ,  the imperial favourite ,  until he could rid himself of his wife Octavia Soon suspecting him with regard to this same Poppaea ,  he sent him out of the way to the province of Lusitania ,  ostensibly to be its governor
 Sed Galba post nuntios Germanicae seditionis , quamquam nihil adhuc de Vitellio certum , anxius quonam exercituum vis erumperet , ne urbano quidem militi confisus , quod remedium unicum rebatur , comitia imperii transigit$$ When Galba heard of the mutiny in Germany ,  though nothing was as yet known about Vitellius ,  he felt anxious as to the direction which the violence of the legions might take ,  while he could not trust even the soldiery of the capital He therefore resorted to what he supposed to be the only remedy ,  and held a council for the election of an emperor
 adhibitoque super Vinium ac Laconem Mario Celso consule designato ac Ducenio Gemino praefecto urbis , pauca praefatus de sua senectute , Pisonem Licinianum accersiri iubet , seu propria electione sive , ut quidam crediderunt , Lacone instante , cui apud Rubellium Plautum exercita cum Pisone amicitia$$ To this he summoned ,  besides Vinius and Laco ,  Marius Celsus ,  consul elect ,  and Ducennius Geminus ,  prefect of the city Having first said a few words about his advanced years ,  he ordered Piso Licinianus to be summoned It is uncertain whether he acted on his own free choice ,  or ,  as believed by some ,  under the influence of Laco ,  who through Rubellius Plautus had cultivated the friendship of Piso
 sed callide ut ignotum fovebat , et prospera de Pisone fama consilio eius fidem addiderat$$ But ,  cunningly enough ,  it was as a stranger that Laco supported him ,  and the high character of Piso gave weight to his advice
 Piso Marcus Crasso et Scribonia genitus , nobilis utrimque , vultu habituque moris antiqui et aestimatione recta severus , deterius interpretantibus tristior habebatur$$ Piso ,  who was the son of M Crassus and Scribonia ,  and thus of noble descent on both sides ,  was in look and manner a man of the old type Rightly judged ,  he seemed a stern man ,  morose to those who estimated him less favourably
 ea pars morum eius quo suspectior sollicitis adoptanti placebat$$ This point in his character pleased his adopted father in proportion as it raised the anxious suspicions of others
 Igitur Galba , adprehensa Pisonis manu , in hunc modum locutus fertur$$ We are told that Galba ,  taking hold of Piso's hand ,  spoke to this effect 
 si te privatus lege curiata apud pontifices , ut moris est , adoptarem , et mihi egregium erat Gnaeus Pompei et Marcus Crassi subolem in penatis meos adsciscere , et tibi insigne Sulpiciae ac Lutatiae decora nobilitati tuae adiecisse$$  If I were a private man ,  and were now adopting you by the Act of the Curiae before the Pontiffs ,  as our custom is ,  it would be a high honour to me to introduce into my family a descendant of Cn Pompeius and M
 nunc me deorum hominumque consensu ad imperium vocatum praeclara indoles tua et amor patriae impulit ut principatum , de quo maiores nostri armis certabant , bello adeptus quiescenti offeram , exemplo divi Augusti qui sororis filium Marcellum , dein generum Agrippam , mox nepotes sus , postremo Tiberium Neronem privignum in proximo sibi fastigio conlocavit$$ Crassus it would be a distinction to you to add to the nobility of your race the honours of the Sulpician and Lutatian houses As it is ,  I ,  who have been called to the throne by the unanimous consent of gods and men ,  am moved by your splendid endowments and by my own patriotism to offer to you ,  a man of peace ,  that power ,  for which our ancestors fought ,  and which I myself obtained by war
 sed Augustus in domo successorem quaesivit , ego in re publica , non quia propinquos aut socios belli non habeam , sed neque ipse imperium ambitione accepi , et iudicii mei documentum sit non meae tantum necessitudines , quas tibi postposui , sed et tuae$$ I am following the precedent of the Divine Augustus ,  who placed on an eminence next to his own ,  first his nephew Marcellus ,  then his son-in-law Agrippa ,  afterwards his grandsons ,  and finally Tiberius Nero ,  his stepson
 est tibi frater pari nobilitate , natu maior , dignus hac fortuna nisi tu potior esses ea aetas tua quae cupiditates adulescentiae iam effugerit , ea vita in qua nihil praeteritum excusandum habeas$$ But Augustus looked for a successor in his own family ,  I look for one in the state ,  not because I have no relatives or companions of my campaigns ,  but because it was not by any private favour that I myself received the imperial power
 fortunam adhuc tantum adversam tulisti$$ Let the principle of my choice be shown not only by my connections which I have set aside for you ,  but by your own
 secundae res acrioribus stimulis animos explorant , quia miseriae tolerantur , felicitate corrumpimur$$ You have a brother ,  noble as yourself ,  and older ,  who would be well worthy of this dignity ,  were you not worthier
 fidem , libertatem , amicitiam , praecipua humani animi bona , tu quidem eadem constantia retinebis , sed alii per obsequium imminuent$$ Your age is such as to be now free from the passions of youth ,  and such your life that in the past you have nothing to excuse
 inrumpet adulatio , blanditiae et pessimum veri adfectus venenum , sua cuique utilitas$$ Hitherto ,  you have only borne adversity
 etiam si ego ac tu simplicissime inter nos hodie loquimur , ceteri libentius cum fortuna nostra quam nobiscum$$ prosperity tries the heart with keener temptations
 nam suadere principi quod oporteat multi laboris , adsentatio erga quemcumque principem sine adfectu peragitur$$ for hardships may be endured ,  whereas we are spoiled by success
 Si immensum imperii corpus stare ac librari sine rectore posset , dignus eram a quo res publica inciperet$$ Could the vast frame of this empire have stood and preserved its balance without a directing spirit ,  I was not unworthy of inaugurating a republic
 nunc eo necessitatis iam pridem ventum est ut nec mea senectus conferre plus populo Romano possit quam bonum successorem , nec tua plus iuventa quam bonum principem$$ As it is ,  we have been long reduced to a position ,  in which my age confer no greater boon on the Roman people than a good successor ,  your youth no greater than a good emperor
 sub Tiberio et Gaio et Claudio unius familiae quasi hereditas fuimus$$ Under Tuberous ,  Chairs ,  and Claudius ,  we were ,  so to speak ,  the inheritance of a single family
 loco libertatis erit quod eligi coepimus$$ The choice which begins with us will be a substitute for freedom
 et finita Iuliorum Claudiorumque domo optimum quemque adoptio inveniet$$ Now that the family of the Julii and the Claudii has come to an end ,  adoption will discover the worthiest successor
 nam generari et nasci a principibus fortuitum , nec ultra aestimatur$$ To be begotten and born of a princely race is a mere accident ,  and is only valued as such
 adoptandi iudicium integrum et , si velis eligere , consensu monstratur$$ In adoption there is nothing that need bias the judgment ,  and if you wish to make a choice ,  an unanimous opinion points out the man
 sit ante oculos Nero quem longa Caesarum serie tumentem non Vindex cum inermi provincia aut ego cum una legione , sed sua immanitas , sua luxuria cervicibus publicis depulerunt$$ Let Nero be ever before your eyes ,  swollen with the pride of a long line of Caesars it was not Vindex with his unarmed province ,  it was not myself with my single legion ,  that shook his yoke from our necks
 neque erat adhuc damnati principis exemplum$$ It was his own profligacy ,  his own brutality ,  and that ,  though there had been before no precedent of an emperor condemned by his own people
 nos bello et ab aestimantibus adsciti cum invidia quamvis egregii erimus$$ We ,  who have been called to power by the issues of war ,  and by the deliberate judgment of others ,  shall incur unpopularity ,  however illustrious our character
 ne tamen territus fueris si duae legiones in hoc concussi orbis motu nondum quiescunt$$ Do not however be alarmed ,  if ,  after a movement which has shaken the world ,  two legions are not yet quiet
 ne ipse quidem ad securas res accessi , et audita adoptione desinam videri senex , quod nunc mihi unum obicitur$$ I did not myself succeed to a throne without anxiety
 Nero a pessimo quoque semper desiderabitur$$ and when men shall hear of your adoption I shall no longer be thought old ,  and this is the only objection which is now made against me
 mihi ac tibi providendum est ne etiam a bonis desideretur$$ Nero will always be regretted by the thoroughly depraved
 monere diutius neque temporis huius , et impletum est omne consilium si te bene elegi$$ it is for you and me to take care ,  that he be not regretted also by the good
 utilissimus idem ac brevissimus bonarum malarumque rerum dilectus est , cogitare quid aut volueris sub alio principe aut nolueris$$ To prolong such advice ,  suits not this occasion ,  and all my purpose is fulfilled if I have made a good choice in you
 neque enim hic , ut gentibus quae regnantur , certa dominorum domus et ceteri servi , sed imperaturus es hominibus qui , nec totam servitutem pati possunt nec totam libertatem$$ The most practical and the shortest method of distinguishing between good and bad measures ,  is to think what you yourself would or would not like under another emperor
 et Galba quidem haec ac talia , tamquam principem faceret , ceteri tamquam cum facto loquebantur$$ It is not here ,  as it is among nations despotically ruled ,  that there is a distinct governing family ,  while all the rest are slaves
 Pisonem ferunt statim intuentibus et mox coniectis in eum omnium oculis nullum turbati aut exultantis animi motum prodidisse$$ It is said of Piso that he betrayed no discomposure or excessive joy ,  either to the gaze to which he was immediately subjected ,  or afterwards when all eyes were turned upon him
 sermo erga patrem imperatoremque reverens , de se moderatus$$ His language to the Emperor ,  his father ,  was reverential
 nihil in vultu habituque mutatum , quasi imperare posset magis quam vellet$$ his language about himself was modest He shewed no change in look or manner
 consultatum inde , pro rostris an in senatu an in castris adoptio nuncuparetur iri in castra placuit$$ he seemed like one who had the power rather than the wish to rule It was next discussed whether the adoption should be publicly pronounced in front of the Rostra ,  in the Senate ,  or in the camp
 honorificum id militibus fore , quorum favorem ut largitione et ambitu male adquiri , ita per bonas artis haud spernendum$$ It was thought best to go to the camp This would be a compliment to the soldiery ,  and their favour ,  base as it was to purchase it by bribery or intrigue ,  was not to be despised if it could be obtained by honourable means
 circumsteterat interim Palatium publica expectatio , magni secreti impatiens et male coercitam famam supprimentes augebant$$ Meanwhile the expectant people had surrounded the palace ,  impatient to learn the great secret ,  and those who sought to stifle the ill-concealed rumour did but spread it the more
 Inde apud senatum non comptior Galbae , non longior quam apud militem sermo$$ Then followed Galba's speech in the Senate ,  which was as plain and brief as his speech to the soldiery
 Pisonis comis oratio$$ Piso delivered a graceful oration and was supported by the feeling of the Senate
 et patrum favor aderat$$ Many who wished him well ,  spoke with enthusiasm
 multi voluntate , effusius qui noluerant , medii ac plurimi obvio obsequio , privatas spes agitantes sine publica cura$$ those who had opposed him ,  in moderate terms the majority met him with an officious homage ,  having aims of their own and no thought for the state
 nec aliud sequenti quadriduo , quod medium inter adoptionem et caedem fuit , dictum a Pisone in publico factumve$$ Piso neither said nor did anything else in public in the following four days which intervened between his adoption and his death
 crebrioribus in dies Germanicae defectionis nuntiis et facili civitate ad accipienda credendaque omnia nova cum tristia sunt , censuerant patres mittendos ad Germanicum exercitum legatos$$ As tidings of the mutiny in Germany were arriving with daily increasing frequency ,  while the country was ready to receive and to credit all intelligence that had an unfavourable character ,  the Senate came to a resolution to send deputies to the German armies
 agitatum secreto num et Piso proficisceretur , maiore praetextu , illi auctoritatem senatus , hic dignationem Caesaris laturus$$ It was privately discussed whether Piso should go with them to give them a more imposing appearance they ,  it was said ,  would bring with them the authority of the Senate ,  he the majesty of the Caesar
 placebat et Laconem praetorii praefectum simul mitti$$ It was thought expedient to send with them Cornelius Laco ,  prefect of the Praetorian Guard ,  but he thwarted the design
 is consilio intercessit legati quoque (nam senatus electionem Galbae permiserat) foeda inconstantia nominati , excusati , substituti , ambitu remanendi aut eundi , ut quemque metus vel spes impulerat$$ In nominating ,  excusing ,  and changing the deputies ,  the Senate having entrusted the selection to Galba ,  the Emperor shewed a disgraceful want of firmness ,  yielding to individuals ,  who made interest to stay or to go ,  as their fears or their hopes prompted
 Interea Othonem , cui compositis rebus nulla spes , omne in turbido consilium , multa simul extimulabant , luxuria etiam principi onerosa , inopia vix privato toleranda , in Galbam ira , in Pisonem invidia$$ Otho ,  meanwhile ,  who had nothing to hope while the State was tranquil ,  and whose whole plans depended on revolution ,  was being roused to action by a combination of many motives ,  by a luxury that would have embarrassed even an emperor ,  by a poverty that a subject could hardly endure ,  by his rage against Galba ,  by his envy of Piso
 fingebat et metum quo magis concupisceret$$ He even pretended to fear to make himself keener in desire
 praegravem se Neroni fuisse , nec Lusitaniam rursus et alterius exilii honorem expectandum$$ I was ,  said he ,  too formidable to Nero ,  and I must not look for another Lusitania ,  another honourable exile
 suspectum semper invisumque dominanus qui proximus destinaretur$$ Rulers always suspect and hate the man who has been named for the succession
 nocuisse id sibi apud senem principem , magis nociturum apud iuvenem ingenio trucem et longo exilio efferatum$$ This has injured me with the aged Emperor ,  and will injure me yet more with a young man whose temper ,  naturally savage ,  has been rendered ferocious by prolonged exile
 occidi Othonem posse proinde agendum audendumque , dum Galbae auctoritas fluxa , Pisonis nondum coaluisset$$ How easy to put Otho to death! I must therefore do and dare now while Galba's authority is still unsettled ,  and before that of Piso is consolidated
 opportunos magnis conatibus transitus rerum , nec cunctatione opus , ubi perniciosior sit quies quam temeritas$$ Periods of transition suit great attempts ,  and delay is useless where inaction is more hurtful than temerity
 mortem omnibus ex natura aequalem oblivione apud posteros vel gloria distingui$$ Death ,  which nature ordains for all alike ,  yet admits of the distinction of being either forgotten ,  or remembered with honour by posterity
 ac si nocentem innocentemque idem exitus maneat , acrioris viri esse merito perire$$ and ,  if the same lot awaits the innocent and the guilty ,  the man of spirit will at least deserve his fate
 Non erat Othonis mollis et corpori similis animus$$ The soul of Otho was not effeminate like his person
 et intimi libertorum servorumque , corruptius quam in privata domo habiti , aulam Neronis et luxus , adulteria , matrimonia ceterasque regnorum libidines avido talium , si auderet , ut sua ostentantes , quiescenti ut aliena exprobrabant , urgentibus etiam mathematicis , dum novos motus et clarum Othoni annum observatione siderum adfirmant , genus hominum potentibus infidum , sperantibus fallax , quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur multos secreta Poppaeae mathematicos pessimum principalis matrimonii instrumentum , habuerant$$ His confidential freedmen and slaves ,  who enjoyed a license unknown in private families ,  brought the debaucheries of Nero's court ,  its intrigues ,  its easy marriages ,  and the other indulgences of despotic power ,  before a mind passionately fond of such things ,  dwelt upon them as his if he dared to seize them ,  and reproached the inaction that would leave them to others The astrologers also urged him to action ,  predicting from their observation of the heavens revolutions ,  and a year of glory for Otho This is a class of men ,  whom the powerful cannot trust ,  and who deceive the aspiring ,  a class which will always be proscribed in this country ,  and yet always retained
 e quibus Ptolemaeus Othoni in Hispania comes , cum superfuturum eum Neroni promisisset , postquam ex eventu fides , coniectura iam et rumore senium Galbae et iuventam Othonis computantium persuaserat fore ut in imperium adscisceretur$$ Many of these men were attached to the secret councils of Poppaea and were the vilest tools in the employ of the imperial household One of them ,  Ptolemaeus ,  had attended Otho in Spain ,  and had there foretold that his patron would survive Nero
 sed Otho tamquam peritia et monitu fatorum praedicta accipiebat , cupidine ingenii humani libentius obscura credendi$$ Gaining credit by the result ,  and arguing from his own conjectures and from the common talk of those who compared Galba's age with Otho's youth ,  he had persuaded the latter that he would be called to the throne
 nec deerat Ptolemaeus , iam et sceleris instinctor , ad quod facillime ab eius modi voto transitur$$ Otho however received the prediction as the words of wisdom and the intimation of destiny ,  with that inclination so natural to the human mind readily to believe in the mysterious
 Sed sceleris cogitatio incertum an repens$$ Nor did Ptolemaeus fail to play his part
 studia militum iam pridem spe successionis aut paratu facinoris adfectaverat , in itinere , in agmine , in stationibus vetustissimum quemque militum nomine vocans ac memoria Neroniani comitatus contubernalis appellando alios agnoscere , quosdam requirere et pecunia aut gratia iuvare , inserendo saepius querelas et ambiguos de Galba sermones quaeque alia turbamenta vulgi labores itinerum , inopia commeatuum , duritia imperii atrocius accipiebantur , cum Campaniae lacus et Achaiae urbes classibus adire soliti Pyrenaeum et Alpes et immensa viarum spatia aegre sub armis eniterentur$$ he now even prompted to crime ,  to which from such wishes it is easy to pass Whether indeed these thoughts of crime were suddenly conceived ,  is doubtful Otho had long been courting the affections of the soldiery ,  either in the hope of succeeding to the throne ,  or in preparation for some desperate act On the march ,  on parade ,  and in their quarters ,  he would address all the oldest soldiers by name ,  and in allusion to the progresses of Nero would call them his messmates Some he would recognise ,  he would inquire after others ,  and would help them with his money and interest He would often intersperse his conversation with complaints and insinuations against Galba and anything else that might excite the vulgar mind Laborious marches ,  a scanty commissariat ,  and the rigour of military discipline ,  were especially distasteful ,  when men ,  accustomed to sail to the lakes of Campania and the cities of Greece ,  had painfully to struggle under the weight of their arms over the Pyrenees ,  the Alps ,  and vast distances of road
 Flagrantibus iam militum animis velut faces addiderat Maevius Pudens , e proximis Tigellini$$ The minds of the soldiery were already on fire ,  when Maevius Pudens ,  a near relative of Tigellinus ,  added ,  so to speak ,  fuel to the flames
 is mobilissimum quemque ingenio aut pecuniae indigum et in novas cupiditates praecipitem adliciendo eo paulatim progressus est ut per speciem convivii , quotiens Galba apud Othonem epularetur , cohorti excubias agenti viritim centenos nummos divideret$$ In his endeavour to win over all who were particularly weak in character ,  or who wanted money and were ready to plunge into revolution ,  he gradually went so far as to distribute ,  whenever Galba dined with Otho ,  one hundred sesterces to each soldier of the cohort on duty ,  under pretext of treating them This ,  which we may almost call a public bounty ,  Otho followed up by presents more privately bestowed on individuals
 quam velut publicam largitionem Otho secretioribus apud singulos praemiis intendebat , adeo animosus corruptor ut Cocceio Proculo speculatori , de parte finium cum vicino ambigenti , universum vicini agrum sua pecunia emptum dono dederit , per socordiam praefecti , quem nota pariter et occulta fallebant$$ nay he bribed with such spirit ,  that ,  finding there was a dispute between Cocceius Proculus ,  a soldier of the bodyguard ,  and one of his neighbours ,  about some part of their boundaries ,  he purchased with his own money the neighbour's entire estate ,  and made a present of it to the soldier He took advantage of the lazy indifference of the Prefect ,  who overlooked alike notorious facts and secret practices
 Sed tum e libertis Onomastum futuro sceleri praefecit , a quo Barbium Proculum tesserarium speculatorum et Veturium optionem eorundem perductos , postquam vario sermone callidos audacisque cognovit , pretio et promissis onerat , data pecunia ad pertemptandos plurium animos$$ He then entrusted the conduct of his meditated treason to Onomastus ,  one of his freedmen ,  who brought over to his views Barbius Proculus ,  officer of the watchword to the bodyguard ,  and Veturius ,  a deputy centurion in the same force Having assured himself by various conversations with these men that they were cunning and bold ,  he loaded them with presents and promises ,  and furnished them with money with which to tempt the cupidity of others
 suscepere duo manipulares imperium populi Romani transferendum et transtulerunt$$ Thus two soldiers from the ranks undertook to transfer the Empire of Rome ,  and actually transferred it
 in conscientiam facinoris pauci adsciti suspensos ceterorum animos diversis artibus stimulant , primores militum per beneficia Nymphidii ut suspectos , vulgus et ceteros ira et desperatione dilati totiens donativi$$ Only a few were admitted to be accomplices in the plot ,  but they worked by various devices on the wavering minds of the remainder on the more distinguished soldiers ,  by hinting that the favours of Nymphidius had subjected them to suspicion on the vulgar herd ,  by the anger and despair with which the repeated postponement of the donative had inspired them
 erant quos memoria Neronis ac desiderium prioris licentiae accenderet$$ Some were fired by their recollections of Nero and their longing regrets for their old license
 in commune omnes metu mutandae militiae terrebantur$$ All felt a common alarm at the idea of having to serve elsewhere
 Infecit ea tabes legionum quoque et auxiliorum motas iam mentis , postquam vulgatum erat labare Germanici exercitus fidem$$ The contagion spread to the legions and the auxiliary troops ,  already excited by the news of the wavering loyalty of the army of Germany
 adeoque parata apud malos seditio , etiam apud integros dissimulatio fuit , ut postero iduum die redeuntem a cena Othonem rapturi fuerint , ni incerta noctis et tota urbe sparsa militum castra nec facilem inter temulentos consensum timuissent , non rei publicae cura , quam foedare principis sui sanguine sobrii parabant , sed ne per tenebras , ut quisque Pannonici vel Germanici exercitus militibus oblatus esset , ignorantibus plerisque , pro Othone destinaretur$$ So ripe were the disaffected for mutiny and so close the secrecy preserved by the loyal ,  that they would actually have seized Otho on the 14th of January ,  as he was returning from dinner ,  had they not been deterred by the risks of darkness ,  the inconvenient dispersion of the troops over the whole city ,  and the difficulty of concerted action among a half-intoxicated crowd It was no care for the state ,  which they deliberately meditated polluting with the blood of their Emperor it was a fear lest in the darkness of night any one who presented himself to the soldiers of the Pannonian or German army might be fixed on instead of Otho ,  whom few of them knew
 multa erumpentis seditionis indicia per conscios oppressa$$ Many symptoms of the approaching outburst were repressed by those who were in the secret
 quaedam apud Galbae auris praefectus Laco elusit , ignarus militarium animorum consiliique quamvis egregii , quod non ipse adferret , inimicus et adversus peritos pervicax$$ Some hints ,  which had reached Galba's ears ,  were turned into ridicule by Laco the prefect ,  who knew nothing of the temper of the soldiery ,  and who ,  inimical to all measures ,  however excellent ,  which he did not originate ,  obstinately thwarted men wiser than himself
 Octavo decimo kalendas Februarias sacrificanti pro aede Apollinis Galbae haruspex Vmbricius tristia exta et instantis insidias ac domesticum hostem praedicit , audiente Othone (nam proximus adstiterat) idque ut laetum e contrario et suis cogitationibus prosperum interpretante$$ On the 15th of January ,  as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of Apollo ,  the Haruspex Umbricius announced to him that the entrails had a sinister aspect ,  that treachery threatened him ,  that he had an enemy at home Otho heard ,  for he had taken his place close by ,  and interpreted it by contraries in a favourable sense ,  as promising success to his designs
 nec multo post libertus Onomastus nuntiat expectari eum ab architecto et redemptoribus , quae significatio coeuntium iam militum et paratae coniurationis convenerat$$ Not long after his freedman Onomastus informed him that the architect and the contractors were waiting for him It had been arranged thus to indicate that the soldiers were assembling ,  and that the preparations of the conspiracy were complete
 Otho , causam digressus requirentibus , cum emi sibi praedia vetustate suspecta eoque prius exploranda finxisset , innixus liberto per Tiberianam domum in Velabrum , inde ad miliarium aureum sub aedem Saturni pergit$$ To those who inquired the reason of his departure ,  Otho pretended that he was purchasing certain farm-buildings ,  which from their age he suspected to be unsound ,  and which had therefore to be first surveyed Leaning on his freedman's arm ,  he proceeded through the palace of Tiberius to the Velabrum ,  and thence to the golden milestone near the temple of Saturn
 ibi tres et viginti speculatores consalutatum imperatorem ac paucitate salutantium trepidum et sellae festinanter impositum strictis mucronibus rapiunt$$ There three and twenty soldiers of the body-guard saluted him as Emperor ,  and ,  while he trembled at their scanty number ,  put him hastily into a chair ,  drew their swords ,  and hurried him onwards
 totidem ferme milites in itinere adgregantur , alii conscientia , plerique miraculo , pars clamore et gladiis , pars silentio , animum ex eventu sumpturi$$ About as many more soldiers joined them on their way ,  some because they were in the plot ,  many from mere surprise some shouted and brandished their swords ,  others proceeded in silence ,  intending to let the issue determine their sentiments
 Stationem in castris agebat Iulius Martialis tribunus$$ Julius Martialis was the tribune on guard in the camp
 is magnitudine subiti sceleris , an corrupta latius castra et , si contra tenderet , exitium metuens , praebuit plerisque suspicionem conscientiae$$ Appalled by the enormity and suddenness of the crime ,  or perhaps fearing that the troops were very extensively corrupted and that it would be destruction to oppose them ,  he made many suspect him of complicity
 anteposuere ceteri quoque tribuni centurionesque praesentia dubiis et honestis , isque habitus animorum fuit ut pessimum facinus auderent pauci , plures vellent , omnes paterentur$$ The rest of the tribunes and centurions preferred immediate safety to danger and duty Such was the temper of men's minds ,  that ,  while there were few to venture on so atrocious a treason ,  many wished it done ,  and all were ready to acquiesce
 Ignarus interim Galba et sacris intentus fatigabat alieni iam imperii deos , cum adfertur rumor rapi in castra incertum quem senatorem , mox Othonem esse qui raperetur , simul ex tota urbe , ut quisque obvius fuerat , alii formidine augentes , quidam minora vero , ne tum quidem obliti adulationis$$ Meanwhile the unconscious Galba ,  busy with his sacrifice ,  was importuning the gods of an empire that was now another's A rumour reached him ,  that some senator unknown was being hurried into the camp before long it was affirmed that this senator was Otho At the same time came messengers from all parts of the city ,  where they had chanced to meet the procession ,  some exaggerating the danger ,  some ,  who could not even then forget to flatter ,  representing it as less than the reality
 igitur consultantibus placuit pertemptari animum cohortis , quae in Palatio stationem agebat , nec per ipsum Galbam , cuius integra auctoritas maioribus remediis servabatur$$ On deliberation it was determined to sound the feeling of the cohort on guard in the palace ,  but not through Galba in person ,  whose authority was to be kept unimpaired to meet greater emergencies
 Piso pro gradibus domus vocatos in hunc modum adlocutus est$$ They were accordingly collected before the steps of the palace ,  and Piso addressed them as follows 
 sextus dies agitur , commilitones , ex quo ignarus futuri , et sive optandum hoc nomen sive timendum erat , Caesar adscitus sum$$ Comrades ,  this is the sixth day since I became a Caesar by adoption ,  not knowing what was to happen ,  whether this title was to be desired ,  or dreaded
 quo domus nostrae aut rei publicae fato in vestra manu positum est , non quia meo nomine tristiorem casum paveam , ut qui adversas res expertus cum maxime discam ne secundas quidem minus discriminis habere$$ It rests with you to determine what will be the result to my family and to the state It is not that I dread on my own account the gloomier issue for I have known adversity ,  and I am learning at this very moment that prosperity is fully as dangerous
 patris et senatus et ipsius imperii vicem doleo , si nobis aut perire hodie necesse est aut , quod aeque apud bonos miserum est , occidere$$ It is the lot of my father ,  of the Senate ,  of the Empire itself ,  that I deplore ,  if we have either to fall this day ,  or to do what is equally abhorrent to the good ,  to put others to death
 solacium proximi motus habebamus incruentam urbem et res sine discordia translatas$$ In the late troubles we had this consolation ,  a capital unstained by bloodshed ,  and power transferred without strife
 provisum adoptione videbatur ut ne post Galbam quidem bello locus esset$$ It was thought that by my adoption provision was made against the possibility of war ,  even after Galba's death
 Dilapsis speculatoribus cetera cohors non aspernata contionantem , ut turbidis rebus evenit , forte magis et nullo adhuc consilio rapit signa quam , quod postea creditum est , insidiis et simulatione$$ The soldiers of the body-guard dispersed ,  but the rest of the cohort ,  who shewed no disrespect to the speaker ,  displayed their standards ,  acting ,  as often happens in a disturbance ,  on mere impulse and without any settled plan ,  rather than ,  as was afterwards believed ,  with treachery and an intention to deceive
 missus et Celsus Marius ad electos Illyrici exercitus , Vipsania in porticu tendentis$$ Celsus Marius was sent to the picked troops from the army of Illyricum ,  then encamped in the Portico of Vipsanius
 praeceptum Amullio Sereno et Domitio Sabino primipilaribus , ut Germanicos milites e Libertatis atrio accerserent$$ Instructions were also given to Amulius Serenus and Quintius Sabinus ,  centurions of the first rank ,  to bring up the German soldiers from the Hall of Liberty
 legioni classicae diffidebatur , infestae ob caedem commilitonum , quos primo statim introitu trucidaverat Galba$$ No confidence was placed in the legion levied from the fleet ,  which had been enraged by the massacre of their comrades ,  whom Galba had slaughtered immediately on his entry into the capital
 pergunt etiam in castra praetorianorum tribuni Cetrius Severus , Subrius Dexter , Pompeius Longinus , si incipiens adhuc et necdum adulta seditio melioribus consiliis flecteretur$$ Meanwhile Cetrius Severus ,  Subrius Dexter ,  and Pompeius Longinus ,  all three military tribunes ,  proceeded to the Praetorian camp ,  in the hope that a sedition ,  which was but just commencing ,  and not yet fully matured ,  might be swayed by better counsels
 tribunorum Subrium et Cetrium adorti milites minis , Longinum manibus coercent exarmantque , quia non ordine militiae , sed e Galbae amicis , fidus principi suo et desciscentibus suspectior erat$$ Two of these tribunes ,  Subrius and Cetrius ,  the soldiers assailed with menaces Longinus they seized and disarmed it was not his rank as an officer ,  but his friendship with Galba ,  that bound him to that Prince ,  and roused a stronger suspicion in the mutineers

 Illyrici exercitus electi Celsum infestis pilis proturbant$$ The Illyrian detachments drove Celsus away with a shower of javelins
 Germanica vexilla diu nutavere , invalidis adhuc corporibus et placatis animis , quod eos a Nerone Alexandriam praemissos atque inde rursus longa navigatione aegros impensiore cura Galba refovebat$$ The German veterans wavered long Their frames were still enfeebled by sickness ,  and their minds were favourably disposed towards Galba ,  who ,  finding them exhausted by their long return voyage from Alexandria ,  whither they had been sent on by Nero ,  had supplied their wants with a most unsparing attention
 Vniversa iam plebs Palatium implebat , mixtis servitiis et dissono clamore caedem Othonis et coniuratorum exitium poscentium ut si in circo aut theatro ludicrum aliquod postularent$$ The whole populace and the slaves with them were now crowding the palace ,  clamouring with discordant shouts for the death of Otho and the destruction of the conspirators ,  just as if they were demanding some spectacle in the circus or amphitheatre
 neque illis iudicium aut veritas , quippe eodem die diversa pari certamine postulaturis , sed tradito more quemcumque principem adulandi licentia adclamationum et studiis inanibus$$ They had not indeed any discrimination or sincerity ,  for on that same day they would raise with equal zeal a wholly different cry It was their traditional custom to flatter any ruler with reckless applause and meaningless zeal
 Interim Galbam duae sententiae distinebat$$ Meanwhile two suggestions were keeping Galba in doubt
 Titus Vinius manendum intra domum , opponenda servitia , firmandos aditus , non eundum ad iratos censebat$$ T Vinius thought that he should remain within the palace ,  array the slaves against the foe ,  secure the approaches ,  and not go out to the enraged soldiers
 daret malorum paenitentiae , daret bonorum consensui spatium$$ You should ,  he said ,  give the disaffected time to repent ,  the loyal time to unite
 scelera impetu , bona consilia mora valescere , denique eundi ultro , si ratio sit , eandem mox facultatem , regressum , si paeniteat , inaliena potestate$$ Crimes gain by hasty action ,  better counsels by delay At all events ,  you will still have the same facilities of going out ,  if need be ,  whereas ,  your retreat ,  should you repent of having gone ,  will be in the power of another
 Nec diutius Galba cunctatus speciosiora suadentibus accessit$$ Without further delay Galba sided with these more plausible advisers
 praemissus tamen in castra Piso , ut iuvenis magno nomine , recenti favore et infensus Tito Vinio , seu quia erat seu quia irati ita volebant et facilius de odio creditur$$ Piso was sent on into the camp ,  as being a young man of noble name ,  whose popularity was of recent date ,  and who was a bitter enemy to T Vinius ,  that is ,  either he was so in reality ,  or these angry partisans would have it so ,  and belief in hatred is but too ready
 vixdum egresso Pisone occisum in castris Othonem vagus primum et incertus rumor$$ Piso had hardly gone forth when there came a rumour ,  at first vague and wanting confirmation ,  that Otho had been slain in the camp
 mox , ut in magnis mendaciis , interfuisse se quidam et vidisse adfirmabant , credula fama inter gaudentis et incuriosos$$ soon ,  as happens with these great fictions ,  men asserted that they had been present ,  and had seen the deed and ,  between the delight of some and the indifference of others ,  the report was easily believed
 multi arbitrabantur compositum auctumque rumorem mixtis iam Othonianis , qui ad evocandum Galbam laeta falso vulgaverint$$ Many thought the rumour had been invented and circulated by the Othonianists ,  who were now mingling with the crowd ,  and who disseminated these false tidings of success to draw Galba out of the palace
 Tum vero non populus tantum et imperita plebs in plausus et immodica studia sed equitum plerique ac senatorum , posito metu incauti , refractis Palatii foribus ruere intus ac se Galbae ostentare , praereptam sibi ultionem querentes , ignavissimus quisque et , ut res docuit , in periculo non ausurus , nimii verbis , linguae feroces$$ Upon this not only did the people and the ignorant rabble break out into applause and vehement expressions of zeal ,  but many of the Knights and Senators ,  losing their caution as they laid aside their fear ,  burst open the doors of the palace ,  rushed in ,  and displayed themselves to Galba ,  complaining that their revenge had been snatched from them The most arrant coward ,  the man ,  who ,  as the event proved ,  would dare nothing in the moment of danger ,  was the most voluble and fierce of speech
 nemo scire et omnes adfirmare , donec inopia veri et consensu errantium victus sumpto thorace Galba inruenti turbae neque aetate neque corpore resistens sella levaretur obvius in Palatio Iulius Atticus speculator , cruentum gladium ostentans , occisum a se Othonem exclamavit$$ No one knew anything ,  yet all were confident in assertion ,  till at length Galba in the dearth of all true intelligence ,  and overborne by the universal delusion ,  assumed his cuirass ,  and as ,  from age and bodily weakness ,  he could not stand up against the crowd that was still rushing in ,  he was elevated on a chair He was met in the palace by Julius Atticus ,  a soldier of the body-guard ,  who ,  displaying a bloody sword ,  cried I have slain Otho
 et Galba commilito , inquit , quis iussit$$ Comrade ,  replied Galba ,  who gave the order
 insigni animo ad coercendam militarem licentiam , minantibus intrepidus , adversus blandientis incorruptus$$ So singularly resolute was his spirit in curbing the license of the soldiery threats did not dismay him ,  nor flatteries seduce
 Haud dubiae iam in castris omnium mentes tantusque ardor ut non contenti agmine et corporibus in suggestu , in quo paulo ante aurea Galbae statua fuerat , medium inter signa Othonem vexillis circumdarent$$ There was now no doubt about the feeling of all the troops in the camp So great was their zeal ,  that ,  not content with surrounding Otho with their persons in close array ,  they elevated him to the pedestal ,  on which a short time before had stood the gilt statue of Galba ,  and there ,  amid the standards ,  encircled him with their colours
 nec tribunis aut centurionibus adeundi locus$$ Neither tribunes nor centurions could approach
 gregarius miles caveri insuper praepositos iubebat$$ The common soldiers even insisted that all the officers should be watched
 strepere cuncta clamoribus et tumultu et exhortatione mutua , non tamquam in populo ac plebe , variis segni adulatione vocibus , sed ut quemque adfluentium militum aspexerant , prensare manibus , complecti armis , conlocare iuxta , praeire sacramentum , modo imperatorem militibus , modo milites imperatori commendare , nec deerat Otho protendens manus adorare vulgum , iacere oscula et omnia serviliter pro dominatione$$ Everything was in an uproar with their tumultuous cries and their appeals to each other ,  which were not ,  like those of a popular assembly or a mob ,  the discordant expressions of an idle flattery on the contrary ,  as soon as they caught sight of any of the soldiers who were flocking in ,  they seized him ,  gave him the military embrace ,  placed him close to Otho ,  dictated to him the oath of allegiance ,  commending sometimes the Emperor to his soldiers ,  sometimes the soldiers to their Emperor Otho did not fail to play his part he stretched out his arms ,  and bowed to the crowd ,  and kissed his hands ,  and altogether acted the slave ,  to make himself the master
 postquam universa classicorum legio sacramentum eius accepit , fidens viribus , et quos adhuc singulos extimulaverat , accendendos in commune ratus pro vallo castorum ita coepit$$ It was when the whole legion from the fleet had taken the oath to him ,  that feeling confidence in his strength ,  and thinking that the men ,  on whose individual feeling he had been working ,  should be roused by a general appeal ,  he stood before the rampart of the camp ,  and spoke as follows 
 Quis ad vos processerim commilitones , dicere non possum , quia nec privatum me vocare sustineo princeps a vobis nominatus , nec principem alio imperante$$ Comrades ,  I cannot say in what character I have presented myself to you I refuse to call myself a subject ,  now that you have named me Prince ,  or Prince ,  while another reigns
 vestrum quoque nomen in incerto erit donec dubitabitur imperatorem populi Romani in castris an hostem habeatis$$ Your title also will be equally uncertain ,  so long as it shall be a question ,  whether it is the Emperor of the Roman people ,  or a public enemy ,  whom you have in your camp
 auditisne ut poena mea et supplicium vestrum simul postulentur$$ Mark you ,  how in one breath they cry for my punishment and for your execution
 adeo manifestum est neque perire nos neque salvos esse nisi una posse$$ So evident it is ,  that we can neither perish ,  nor be saved ,  except together
 et cuius lenitatis est Galba , iam fortasse promisit , ut qui nullo exposcente tot milia innocentissimorum militum trucidaverit$$ Perhaps ,  with his usual clemency ,  Galba has already promised that we should die ,  like the man ,  who ,  though no one demanded it ,  massacred so many thousands of perfectly guiltless soldiers
 horror animum subit quotiens recordor feralem introitum et hanc solam Galbae victoriam , cum in oculis urbis decimari deditos iuberet , quos deprecantis in fidem acceperat$$ A shudder comes over my soul ,  whenever I call to mind that ghastly entry ,  Galba's solitary victory ,  when ,  before the eyes of the capital he gave orders to decimate the prisoners ,  the suppliants ,  whom he had admitted to surrender
 his auspiciis urbem ingressus , quam gloriam ad principatum attulit nisi occisi Obultronii Sabini et Cornelii Marcelli in Hispania , Betui Cilonis in Gallia , Fontei Capitonis in Germania , Clodii Macri in Africa , Cingonii in via , Turpiliani in urbe , Nymphidii in castris$$ These were the auspices with which he entered the city What is the glory that he has brought to the throne None but that he has murdered Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius Marcellus in Spain ,  Betuus Chilo in Gaul ,  Fonteius Capito in Germany ,  Clodius Macer in Africa ,  Cingonius on the high road ,  Turpilianus in the city ,  Nymphidius in the camp
 quae usquam provincia , quae castra sunt nisi cruenta et maculata aut , ut ipse praedicat , emendata et correcta$$ What province ,  what camp in the world ,  but is stained with blood and foul with crime ,  or ,  as he expresses it himself ,  purified and chastened
 nam quae alii scelera , hic remedia vocat , dum falsis nominibus severitatem pro saevitia , parsimoniam pro avaritia , supplicia et contumelias vestras disciplinam appellat$$ For what others call crimes he calls reforms ,  and ,  by similar misnomers ,  he speaks of strictness instead of barbarity ,  of economy instead of avarice ,  while the cruelties and affronts inflicted upon you he calls discipline
 septem a Neronis fine menses sunt , et iam plus rapuit Icelus quam quod Polycliti et Vatinii et Aegiali perdiderunt$$ Seven months only have passed since Nero fell ,  and already Icelus has seized more than the Polycleti ,  the Vatinii ,  and the Elii amassed

 Ac ne qua saltem in successore Galbae spes esset accersit ab exilio quem tristitia et avaritia sui simillimum iudicabat$$ Again ,  that we might have nothing to hope even from his successor ,  Galba fetches out of exile the man in whose ill-humour and avarice he considers that he has found the best resemblance to himself

 iam Marius Celsus haud laeta rettulerat , cum alii in Palatium redire , alii Capitolium petere , plerique rostra occupanda censerent , plures tantum sententiis aliorum contra dicerent , utque evenit in consiliis infelicibus , optima viderentur quorum tempus effugerat$$ Already Marius Celsus had brought back discouraging tidings And now some advised that the Emperor should return to the palace ,  others that he should make for the Capitol ,  many again that he should occupy the Rostra ,  though most did but oppose the opinions of others ,  while ,  as ever happens in these ill-starred counsels ,  plans for which the opportunity had slipped away seemed the best
 agitasse Laco ignaro Galba de occidendo Tito Vinio dicitur , sive ut poena eius animos militum mulceret , seu conscium Othonis credebat , ad postremum vel odio$$ It is said that Laco ,  without Galba's knowledge ,  meditated the death of Vinius ,  either hoping by this execution to appease the fury of the soldiers ,  or believing him to be an accomplice of Otho ,  or ,  it may be ,  out of mere hatred
 haesitationem attulit tempus ac locus , quia initio caedis orto difficilis modus$$ The time and the place however made him hesitate he knew that a massacre once begun is not easily checked
 et turbavere consilium trepidi nuntii ac proximorum diffugia , languentibus omnium studiis qui primo alacres fidem atque animum ostentaverant$$ His plan too was disconcerted by a succession of alarming tidings ,  and the desertion of immediate adherents So languid was now the zeal of those who had at first been eager to display their fidelity and courage
 Agebatur huc illuc Galba vario turbae fluctuantis impulsu , completis undique basilicis ac templis , lugubri prospectu$$ Galba was hurried to and fro with every movement of the surging crowd the halls and temples all around were thronged with spectators of this mournful sight

 ire praecipitis et occupare pericula iubet$$ He ordered his men to hurry on at full speed ,  and to anticipate the danger
 igitur milites Romani , quasi Vologaesum aut Pacorum avito Arsacidarum solio depulsuri ac non imperatorem suum inermem et senem trucidare pergerent , disiecta plebe , proculcato senatu , truces armis , rapidi equis forum inrumpunt$$ Then did Roman soldiers rush forward like men who had to drive a Vologeses or Pacorus from the ancestral throne of the Arsacidae ,  not as though they were hastening to murder their aged and defenceless Emperor In all the terror of their arms ,  and at the full speed of their horses ,  they burst into the Forum ,  thrusting aside the crowd and trampling on the Senate

 quod seu finxit formidine seu conscientiam coniurationis confessus est , huc potius eius vita famaque inclinat , ut conscius sceleris fuerit cuius causa erat$$ Either he invented this in his terror ,  or he thus confessed his share in the conspiracy His life and character incline us rather to believe that he was an accomplice in the crime which he certainly caused
 ante aedem divi Iulii iacuit primo ictu in poplitem , mox ab Iulio Caro legionario milite in utrumque latus transverberatus$$ He fell in front of the temple of the Divine Julius ,  and at the first blow ,  which struck him on the back of the knee immediately afterwards Julius Carus ,  a legionary ,  ran him through the body

 centurio is praetoriae cohortis , a Galba custodiae Pisonis additus , stricto pugione occurrens armatis et scelus exprobrans ac modo manu modo voce vertendo in se percussores quamquam vulnerato Pisoni effugium dedit$$ He was a centurion in a cohort of the Praetorian Guard ,  and had been appointed by Galba to escort Piso Rushing ,  dagger in hand ,  to meet the armed men ,  and upbraiding them with their crime ,  he drew the attention of the murderers on himself by his exclamations and gestures ,  and thus gave Piso ,  wounded as he was ,  an opportunity of escape
 Piso in aedem Vestae pervasit , exceptusque misericordia publici servi et contubernio eius abditus non religione nec caerimoniis sed latebra inminens exitium differebat , cum advenere missu Othonis nominatim in caedem eius ardentis Sulpicius Florus e Britannicis cohortibus , nuper a Galba civitate donatus , et Statius Murcus speculator , a quibus protractus Piso in foribus templi trucidatur$$ Piso made his way to the temple of Vesta ,  where he was admitted by the compassion of one of the public slaves ,  who concealed him in his chamber There ,  not indeed through the sanctity of the place or its worship ,  but through the obscurity of his hiding-place ,  he obtained a respite from instant destruction ,  till there came ,  by Otho's direction and specially eager to slay him ,  Sulpicius Florus ,  of the British auxiliary infantry ,  to whom Galba had lately given the citizenship ,  and Statius Murcus ,  one of the body-guard Piso was dragged out by these men and slaughtered in the entrance of the temple
 Nullam caedem Otho maiore laetitia excepisse , nullum caput tam insatiabilibus oculis perlustrasse dicitur , seu tum primum levata omni sollicitudine mens vacare gaudio coeperat , seu recordatio maiestatis in Galba , amicitiae in Tito Vinio quamvis immitem animum imagine tristi confuderat , Pisonis ut inimici et aemuli caede laetari ius fasque credebat$$ There was ,  we are told ,  no death of which Otho heard with greater joy ,  no head which he surveyed with so insatiable a gaze Perhaps it was ,  that his mind was then for the first time relieved from all anxiety ,  and so had leisure to rejoice perhaps there was with Galba something to recall departed majesty ,  with Vinius some thought of old friendship ,  which troubled with mournful images even that ruthless heart Piso's death ,  as that of an enemy and a rival ,  he felt to be a right and lawful subject of rejoicing
 praefixa contis capita gestabantur inter signa cohortium iuxta aquilam legionis , certatim ostentantibus cruentas manus qui occiderant , qui interfuerant , qui vere qui falso ut pulchrum et memorabile facinus iactabant$$ The heads were fixed upon poles and carried about among the standards of the cohorts ,  close to the eagle of the legion ,  while those who had struck the blow ,  those who had been present ,  those who whether truly or falsely boasted of the act ,  as of some great and memorable achievement ,  vied in displaying their bloodstained hands
 plures quam centum viginti libellos praemium exposcentium ob aliquam notabilem illa die operam Vitellius postea invenit , omnisque conquiri et interfici iussit , non honori Galbae , sed tradito principibus more munimentum ad praesens , in posterum ultionem$$ Vitellius afterwards found more than 120 memorials from persons who claimed a reward for some notable service on that day All these persons he ordered to be sought out and slain ,  not to honour Galba ,  but to comply with the traditional policy of rulers ,  who thus provide protection for the present and vengeance for the future
 Alium crederes senatum , alium populum$$ One would have thought it a different Senate ,  a different people
 ruere cuncti in castra , anteire proximos , certare cum praecurrentibus , increpare Galbam , laudare militum iudicium , exosculari Othonis manum$$ All rushed to the camp ,  outran those who were close to them ,  and struggled with those who were before ,  inveighed against Galba ,  praised the wisdom of the soldiers ,  covered the hand of Otho with kisses

 caedis et praedarum initium et optimo cuique perniciem quaeri apparebat , sed Othoni nondum auctoritas inerat ad prohibendum scelus$$ It was evident that they were seeking to begin massacre and plunder ,  and the proscription of all the most virtuous citizens ,  and Otho had not yet sufficient authority to prevent crime ,  though he could command it

 amicorum libertorumque , ubi in bonos incidisset , sine reprehensione patiens , si mali forent , usque ad culpam ignarus$$ To his freedmen and friends he shewed a forbearance ,  which ,  when he had fallen into worthy hands ,  could not be blamed
 sed claritas natalium et metus temporum obtentui , ut , quod segnitia erat , sapientia vocaretur$$ when ,  however ,  these persons were worthless ,  he was even culpably blind
 dum vigebat aetas militari laude apud Germanas floruit$$ The nobility of his birth and the perils of the times made what was really indolence pass for wisdom

 Nunc initia causasque motus Vitelliani expediam$$ I will now describe the origin and occasion of the revolt of Vitellius
 caeso cum omnibus copiis Iulio Vindice ferox praeda gloriaque exercitus , ut cui sine labore ac periculo ditissimi belli victoria evenisset , expeditionem et aciem , praemia quam stipendia malebat$$ After the destruction of Julius Vindex and his whole force ,  the army ,  flushed with the delights of plunder and glory ,  as men might well be who had been fortunate enough to triumph without toil or danger in a most lucrative war ,  began to hanker after compaigns and battles ,  and to prefer prize money to pay
 diu infructuosam et asperam militiam toleraverant ingenio loci caelique et severitate disciplinae , quam in pace inexorabilem discordiae civium resolvunt , paratis utrimque corruptoribus et perfidia impunita$$ They had long endured a service which the character of the country and of the climate and the rigours of military discipline rendered at once unprofitable and severe But that discipline ,  inexorable as it is in times of peace ,  is relaxed by civil strife ,  when on both sides are found the agents of corruption ,  and treachery goes unpunished
 viri , arma , equi ad usum et ad decus supererant sed ante bellum centurias tantum suas turmasque noverant$$ They had men ,  arms and horses ,  more than enough for all purposes of utility and show ,  but before the war they had been acquainted only with the companies and squadrons of their own force ,  as the various armies were separated from each other by the limits of their respective provinces
 exercitus finibus provinciarum discernebantur tum adversus Vindicem contractae legiones , seque et Gallias expertae , quaerere rursus arma novasque discordias$$ But the legions ,  having been concentrated to act against Vindex ,  and having thus learnt to measure their own strength against the strength of Gaul ,  were now on the lookout for another war and for new conflicts
 nec socios , ut olim , sed hostis et victos vocabant$$ They called their neighbours ,  not allies as of old ,  but the enemy and the vanquished
 nec deerat pars Galliarum , quae Rhenum accolit , easdem partis secuta ac tum acerrima instigatrix adversum Galbianos$$ Nor did that part of Gaul which borders on the Rhine fail to espouse the same cause ,  and to the bitterest hostility in inflaming the army against the Galbianists ,  that being the name ,  which in their contempt for Vindex they had given to the party
 hoc enim nomen fastidito Vindice indiderant igitur Sequanis Aeduisque ac deinde , prout opulentia civitatibus erat , infensi expugnationes urbium , populationes agrorum , raptus penatium hauserunt animo , super avaritiam et adrogantiam , praecipua validiorum vitia , contumacia Gallorum inritati , qui remissam sibi a Galba quartam tributorum partem et publice donatos in ignominiam exercitus iactabant$$ The rage first excited against the Sequani and Aedui extended to other states in proportion to their wealth ,  and they revelled in imagination on the storm of cities ,  the plunder of estates ,  the sack of dwelling-houses But ,  besides the rapacity and arrogance which are the special faults of superior strength ,  they were exasperated by the bravadoes of the Gallic people ,  who in a spirit of insult to the army boasted of how they had been relieved by Galba from a fourth part of their tribute ,  and had received grants from the State
 accessit callide vulgatum , temere creditum , decimari legiones et promptissimum quemque centurionum dimitti$$ There was also a report ,  ingeniously spread and recklessly believed ,  to the effect that the legions were being decimated ,  and all the most energetic centurions dismissed
 undique atroces nuntii , sinistra ex urbe fama$$ From all quarters arrived the most alarming tidings
 infensa Lugdunensis colonia et pertinaci pro Nerone fide fecunda rumoribus$$ The reports from the capital were unfavourable ,  while the disaffection of the colony of Lugdunum ,  which obstinately adhered to Nero ,  gave rise to a multitude of rumours
 sed plurima ad fingendum credendumque materies in ipsis castris , odio metu et , ubi viris suas respexerant , securitate$$ But it was in the army itself ,  in its hatreds ,  its fears ,  and even in the security with which a review of its own strength inspired it ,  that there was the most abundant material for the exercise of imagination and credulity
 Sub ipsas superioris anni kalendas Decembris Aulus Vitellius inferiorem Germaniam ingressus hiberna legionum cum cura adierat$$ Just before December 1 in the preceding year ,  Aulus Vitellius had visited Lower Germany ,  and had carefully inspected the winter quarters of the legions
 redditi plerisque ordines , remissa ignominia , adlevatae notae$$ Many had their rank restored to them ,  sentences of degradation were cancelled ,  and marks of disgrace partially removed
 plura ambitione , quaedam iudicio , in quibus sordis et avaritiam Fontei Capitonis adimendis adsignandisve militiae ordinibus integre mutaverat$$ In most cases he did but court popularity ,  in some he exercised a sound discretion ,  making a salutary change from the meanness and rapacity which Fonteius Capito had shown in bestowing and withdrawing promotion
 nec consularis legati mensura sed in maius omnia accipiebantur$$ But he seemed a greater personage than a simple consular legate ,  and all his acts were invested with an unusual importance
 et ut Vitellius apud severos humilis , ita comitatem bonitatemque faventes vocabant , quod sine modo , sine iudicio donaret sua , largiretur aliena$$ Though sterner judges pronounced Vitellius to be a man of low tastes ,  those who were partial to him attributed to geniality and good nature the immoderate and indiscriminate prodigality ,  with which he gave away what was his own ,  and squandered what did not belong to him
 simul aviditate imperitandi ipsa vitia pro virtutibus interpretabantur$$ Besides this ,  men themselves eager for power were ready to represent his very vices as virtues
 multi in utroque exercitu sicut modesti quietique ita mali et strenui$$ As there were in both armies many of obedient and quiet habits ,  so there were many who were as unprincipled as they were energetic

 e quibus Valens infensus Galbae , tamquam detectam a se Verginii cunctationem , oppressa Capitonis consilia ingrate tulisset , instigare Vitellium , ardorem militum ostentans$$ One of these men ,  Valens ,  had taken offence against Galba ,  under the notion that he had not shewn proper gratitude for his services in discovering to him the hesitation of Verginius and crushing the plans of Capito

 quatiebatur his segne ingenium ut concupisceret magis quam ut speraret$$ You have only to open your arms ,  and to meet the advances of fortune
 At in superiore Germania Caecina , decorus iuventa , corpore ingens , animi immodicus , scito sermone , erecto incessu , studia militum inlexerat$$ These arguments roused the indolent temper of the man ,  yet roused him rather to wish than to hope for the throne Meanwhile however in Upper Germany Caecina ,  young and handsome ,  of commanding stature ,  and of boundless ambition ,  had attracted the favour of the soldiery by his skilful oratory and his dignified mien
 hunc iuvenem Galba , quaestorem in Baetica impigre in partis suas transgressum , legioni praeposuit mox compertum publicam pecuniam avertisse ut peculatorem flagitari iussit$$ This man had ,  when quaestor in Baetica ,  attached himself with zeal to the party of Galba ,  who had appointed him ,  young as he was ,  to the command of a legion ,  but ,  it being afterwards discovered that he had embezzled the public money ,  Galba directed that he should be prosecuted for peculation
 Caecina aegre passus miscere cuncta et privata vulnera rei publicae malis operire statuit$$ Caecina ,  grievously offended ,  determined to throw everything into confusion ,  and under the disasters of his country to conceal his private dishonour
 nec deerant in exercitu semina discordiae , quod et bello adversus Vindicem universus adfuerat , nec nisi occiso Nerone translatus in Galbam atque in eo ipso sacramento vexillis inferioris Germaniae praeventus erat et Treviri ac Lingones , quasque alias civitates atrocibus edictis aut damno finium Galba perculerat , hibernis legionum propius miscentur unde seditiosa colloquia et inter paganos corruptior miles$$ There were not wanting in the army itself the elements of civil strife The whole of it had taken part in the war against Vindex it had not passed over to Galba till Nero fell even then in this transference of its allegiance it had been anticipated by the armies of Lower Germany Besides this ,  the Treveri ,  the Lingones ,  and the other states which Galba had most seriously injured by his severe edicts and by the confiscation of their territory ,  were particularly close to the winter-quarters of the legions Thence arose seditious conferences ,  a soldiery demoralized by intercourse with the inhabitants of the country ,  and tendencies in favour of Verginius ,  which could easily be to the profit of any other person
 Miserat civitas Lingonum vetere instituto dona legionibus dextras , hospitii insigne$$ The Lingones ,  following an old custom ,  had sent presents to the legions ,  right hands clasped together ,  an emblem of friendship
 legati eorum in squalorem maestitiamque compositi per principia per contubernia modo suas iniurias , modo vicinarum civitatium praemia , et ubi pronis militum auribus accipiebantur , ipsius exercitus pericula et contumelias conquerentes accendebant animos$$ Their envoys ,  who had assumed a studied appearance of misery and distress ,  passed through the headquarters and the men's tents ,  and complaining ,  now of their own wrongs ,  now of the rewards bestowed on the neighbouring states ,  and ,  when they found the soldiers' ears open to their words ,  of the perils and insults to which the army itself was exposed ,  inflamed the passions of the troops
 nec procul seditione aberant cum Hordeonius Flaccus abire legatos , utque occultior digressus esset , nocte castris excedere iubet$$ The legions were on the verge of mutiny ,  when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered the envoys to depart ,  and to make their departure more secret ,  directed them to leave the camp by night
 inde atrox rumor , adfirmantibus plerisque interfectos , ac ni sibi ipsi consulerent , fore ut acerrimi militum et praesentia conquesti per tenebras et inscitiam ceterorum occiderentur obstringuntur in ter se tacito foedere legiones , adsciscitur auxiliorum miles , primo suspectus tamquam circumdatis cohortibus alisque impetus in legiones pararetur , mox eadem acrius volvens , faciliore inter malos consensu ad bellum quam in pace ad concordiam$$ Hence arose a frightful rumour ,  many asserting that the envoys had been killed ,  and that ,  unless the soldiers provided their own safety ,  the next thing would be ,  that the most energetic of their number ,  and those who had complained of their present condition ,  would be slaughtered under cover of night ,  when the rest of the army would know nothing of their fate The legions then bound themselves by a secret agreement Into this the auxiliary troops were admitted At first objects of suspicion ,  from the idea that their infantry and cavalry were being concentrated in preparation for an attack on the legions ,  these troops soon became especially zealous in the scheme
 Inferioris tamen Germaniae legiones sollemni kalendarum Ianuariarum sacramento pro Galba adactae , multa cunctatione et raris primorum ordinum vocibus , ceteri silentio proximi cuiusque audaciam expectantes , insita mortalibus natura , propere sequi quae piget inchoare$$ Yet it was to Galba that the legions of Lower Germany took the oath of fidelity annually administered on the first of January It was done ,  however ,  after long delay ,  and then only by a few voices from the foremost ranks ,  while the rest preserved an absolute silence ,  every one waiting for some bold demonstration from his neighbour ,  in obedience to that innate tendency of men ,  which makes them quick to follow where they are slow to lead
 sed ipsis legionibus inerat diversitas animorum$$ And even in the various legions there was a difference of feeling
 primani quintanique turbidi adeo ut quidam saxa in Galbae imagines iecerint$$ The soldiers of the 1st and of the 5th were so mutinous ,  that some of them threw stones at the images of Galba
 quinta decima ac sexta decima legiones nihil ultra fremitum et minas ausae initium erumpendi circumspectabant$$ The 15th and 16th legions ventured on nothing beyond uproar and threatening expressions
 at in superiore exercitu quarta ac duetvicensima legiones , isdem hibernis tendentes , ipso kalendarum Ianuariarum die dirumpunt imagines Galbae , quarta legio promptius , duetvicensima cunctanter , mox consensu$$ They were on the watch for something that might lead to an outbreak In the Upper army ,  however ,  the 4th and 13th legions ,  which were stationed in the same winter-quarters ,  proceeded on this same first of January to break in pieces the images of Galba ,  the 4th legion being foremost ,  the 18th shewing some reluctance ,  but soon joining with the rest
 ac ne reverentiam imperii exuere viderentur , senatus populique Romani oblitterata iam nomina sacramento advocabant , nullo legatorum tribunorumve pro Galba nitente , quibusdam , ut in tumultu , notabilius turbantibus$$ Not however to seem to throw off all their reverence for the Empire ,  they sought to dignify their oath with the now obsolete names of the Senate and people of Rome Not a single legate or tribune exerted himself for Galba some ,  as is usual in a tumult ,  were even conspicuously active in mutiny ,  though no one delivered anything like a formal harangue or spoke from a tribunal
 non tamen quisquam in modum contionis aut suggestu locutus$$ Indeed there was as yet no one to be obliged by such services
 Spectator flagitii Hordeonius Flaccus consularis legatus aderat , non compescere ruentis , non retinere dubios , non cohortari bonos ausus , sed segnis pavidus et socordia innocens$$ Hordeonius Flaccus ,  the consular legate ,  was present and witnessed this outrage ,  but he dared neither check the furious mutineers ,  nor keep the wavering to their duty ,  nor encourage the well affected

 nec cuiquam ultra fides aut memoria prioris sacramenti , sed quod in seditionibus accidit , unde plures erant omnes fuere$$ After this no one retained any sense of duty ,  any recollection of his late allegiance ,  but ,  as usually happens in mutinies ,  the side of the majority became the side of all
 Nocte quae kalendas Ianuarias secuta est in coloniam Agrippinensem aquilifer quartae legionis epulanti Vitellio nuntiat quartam et duetvicensimam legiones proiectis Galbae imaginibus in senatus ac populi Romani verba iurasse$$ In the course of the night of the 1st of January ,  the standard-bearer of the 4th legion ,  coming to the Colonia Agrippinensis ,  announced to Vitellius ,  who was then at dinner ,  the news that the 4th and 18th legions had thrown down the images of Galba ,  and had sworn allegiance to the Senate and people of Rome

 missi a Vitellio ad legiones legatosque qui descivisse a Galba superiorem exercitum nuntiarent proinde aut bellandum adversus desciscentis aut , si concordia et pax placeat , faciendum imperatorem et minore discrimine sumi principem quam quaeri$$ Vitellius sent envoys to the legions and their legates ,  who were to say that the army of Upper Germany had revolted from Galba ,  that it was consequently necessary for them ,  either to make war on the revolters ,  or ,  if they preferred peace and harmony ,  to create an Emperor ,  and who were to suggest ,  that it would be less perilous to accept than to look for a chief
 Igitur laudata militum alacritate Vitellius ministeria principatus per libertos agi solita in equites Romanos disponit , vacationes centurionibus ex fisco numerat , saevitiam militum plerosque ad poenam exposcentium saepius adprobat , raro simulatione vinculorum frustratur$$ Vitellius ,  after bestowing high commendation on the zeal of the soldiers ,  proceeded to distribute among Roman Knights the offices of the Imperial court usually held by freedmen He paid the furlough fees to the centurions out of the Imperial treasury While in most instances he acquiesced in the fury of the soldiers ,  who clamoured for numerous executions ,  in some few he eluded it under the pretence of imprisoning the accused

 grata erat memoria Capitonis , et apud saevientis occidere palam , ignoscere non nisi fallendo licebat$$ The memory of Capito was held in high favour ,  and with that enraged soldiery it was possible to slaughter in open day ,  but to pardon only by stealth

 Divoduri (Mediomatricorum id oppidum est) quamquam omni comitate exceptos subitus pavor terruit , raptis repente armis ad caedem innoxiae civitatis , non ob praedam aut spoliandi cupidine , sed furore et rabie et causis incertis eoque difficilioribus remediis , donec precibus ducis mitigati ab excidio civitatis temperavere$$ But at Divodurum ,  a town of the Mediomatrici ,  though they had been received with the most courteous hospitality ,  a sudden panic mastered them In a moment they took up arms to massacre an innocent people ,  not for the sake of plunder ,  or fired by the lust of spoil ,  but in a wild frenzy arising from causes so vague that it was very difficult to apply a remedy Soothed at length by the entreaties of their general ,  they refrained from utterly destroying the town

 iurgia primum , mox rixa inter Batavos et legionarios , dum his aut illis studia militum adgregantur , prope in proelium exarsere , ni Valens animadversione paucorum oblitos iam Batavos imperii admonuisset$$ First came angry words ,  then a brawl between the Batavi and the legionaries ,  which as the partialities of the soldiers espoused one or another of the parties was almost kindled into a battle ,  and would have been so ,  had not Valens by punishing a few ,  reminded Batavi of the authority which they had now forgotten

 ne Vitellius quidem verbis et minis temperabat , cum Claudius Cossus , unus ex legatis , notae facundiae sed dicendi artem apta trepidatione occultans atque eo validior , militis animum mitigavit ut est mos , vulgus mutabile subitis et tam pronum in misericordiam quam immodicum saevitia fuerat$$ Even Vitellius himself did not refrain from threatening words and gestures ,  till at length Claudius Cossus ,  one of the Helvetian envoys ,  a man of well-known eloquence ,  but who then concealed the art of the orator under an assumption of alarm ,  and was therefore more effective ,  soothed the rage of the soldiers ,  who ,  like all multitudes ,  were liable to sudden impulses ,  and were now as inclined to pity as they had been extravagant in fury

 laeta primoribus civitatis , celebrata in vulgus Celsi salus ne militibus quidem ingrata fuit , eandem virtutem admirantibus cui irascebantur$$ The escape of Celsus gratified the leading men in the State ,  was generally praised by the people ,  and did not displease even the soldiers ,  who could not but admire the virtue which provoked their anger

 haud dubie servaverat , non clementia , quippe tot interfectis , sed effugium in futurum , quia pessimus quisque diffidentia praesentium mutationem pavens adversus publicum odium privatam gratiam praeparat$$ And doubtless he had preserved her life ,  not indeed out of mercy ,  when he had murdered so many ,  but to secure for himself a refuge for the future For all the greatest villains ,  distrusting the present ,  and dreading change ,  look for private friendship to shelter them from public detestation ,  caring not to be free from guilt ,  but only to ensure their turn in impunity
 unde nulla innocentiae cura sed vices impunitatis$$ This enraged the people more than ever ,  the recent unpopularity of Vinius being superadded to their old hatred against Tigellinus
 eo infensior populus , addita ad vetus Tigellini odium recenti Titi Vinii invidia , concurrere ex tota urbe in Palatium ac fora et , ubi plurima vulgi licentia , in circum ac theatra effusi seditiosis vocibus strepere , donec Tigellinus accepto apud Sinuessanas aquas supremae necessitatis nuntio inter stupra concubinarum et oscula et deformis moras sectis novacula faucibus infamem vitam foedavit etiam exitu sero et inhonesto$$ They rushed from every part of the city into the palace and forum ,  and bursting into the circus and theatre ,  where the mob enjoy a special license ,  broke out into seditious clamours At length Tigellinus ,  having received at the springs of Sinuessa a message that his last hour was come ,  amid the embraces and caresses of his mistresses and other unseemly delays ,  cut his throat with a razor ,  and aggravated the disgrace of an infamous life by a tardy and ignominious death
 Per idem tempus expostulata ad supplicium Calvia Crispinilla variis frustrationibus et adversa dissimulantis principis fama periculo exempta est$$ About the same time a demand was made for the execution of Galvia Crispinilla Various artifices on the part of the Emperor ,  who incurred much obloquy by his duplicity ,  rescued her from the danger
 magistra libidinum Neronis , transgressa in Africam ad instigandum in arma Clodium Macrum , famem populo Romano haud obscure molita , totius postea civitatis gratiam obtinuit , consulari matrimonio subnixa et apud Galbam Othonem Vitellium inlaesa , mox potens pecunia et orbitate , quae bonis malisque temporibus iuxta valent$$ She had instructed Nero in profligacy ,  had passed over into Africa ,  that she might urge Macer into rebellion ,  and had openly attempted to bring a famine upon Rome Yet she afterwards gained universal popularity on the strength of her alliance with a man of consular rank ,  and lived unharmed through the reigns of Galba ,  Otho ,  and Vitellius Soon she became powerful as a rich and childless woman ,  circumstances which have as great weight in good as in evil times
 Crebrae interim et muliebribus blandimentis infectae ab Othone ad Vitellium epistulae offerebant pecuniam et gratiam et quemcumque e quietis prodigae vitae legisset$$ Meanwhile frequent letters ,  disfigured by unmanly flatteries ,  were addressed by Otho to Vitellius ,  with offers of wealth and favour and any retreat he might select for a life of prodigal indulgence

 praetoriani , quos per simulationem officii legatis Otho adiunxerat , remissi antequam legionibus miscerentur$$ Some Praetorians ,  whom Otho had attached to the embassy ,  ostensibly as a mark of distinction ,  were sent back before they could mix with the legions

 increpabat ultro quod tanto ante traditum Vitellio imperium ad Othonem vertissent$$ Valens even reproached them with having transferred the Imperial power to Otho ,  though it had so long before been entrusted to Vitellius
 Ita promissis simul ac minis temptabantur , ut bello impares , in pace nihil amissuri$$ Thus they were assailed by promises as well as by threats ,  were told that they were not strong enough for war ,  but would lose nothing by peace
 neque ideo praetorianorum fides mutata$$ Yet all this did not shake the loyalty of the Praetorians
 sed insidiatores ab Othone in Germaniam , a Vitellio in urbem missi$$ Nevertheless secret emissaries were dispatched by Otho to Germany ,  and by Vitellius to Rome

 id principibus et nobilissimo cuique tegimen , ferreis lamminis aut praeduro corio consertum , ut adversus ictus impenetrabile ita impetu hostium provolutis inhabile ad resurgendum$$ These coats are worn as defensive armour by the princes and most distinguished persons of the tribe They are formed of plates of iron or very tough hides ,  and though they are absolutely impenetrable to blows ,  yet they make it difficult for such as have been overthrown by the charge of the enemy to regain their feet
 simul altitudine et mollitia nivis hauriebantur$$ Besides ,  the Sarmatians were perpetually sinking in the deep and soft snow
 Romanus miles facilis lorica et missili pilo aut lanceis adsultans , ubi res posceret , levi gladio inermem Sarmatam (neque enim scuto defendi mos est) comminus fodiebat , donec pauci qui proelio superfuerant paludibus abderentur$$ The Roman soldier ,  moving easily in his cuirass ,  continued to harass them with javelins and lances ,  and whenever the occasion required ,  closed with them with his short sword ,  and stabbed the defenceless enemy for it is not their custom to defend themselves with a shield

 fremit miles et tribunos centurionesque proditionis arguit , tamquam familiae senatorum ad perniciem Othonis armarentur , pars ignari et vino graves , pessimus quisque in occasionem praedarum , vulgus , ut mos est , cuiuscumque motus novi cupidum$$ many acted in ignorance and were stupefied by wine ,  the worst among them were seeking an opportunity for plunder ,  the mass was as usual ready for any new movement ,  and the military obedience of the better disposed was neutralised by the darkness The tribune ,  who sought to check the movement ,  and the strictest disciplinarians among the centurions ,  were cut down

 qui trepidi , fortuitusne militum furor an dolus imperatoris , manere ac deprehendi an fugere et dispergi periculosius foret , modo constantiam simulare , modo formidine detegi , simul Othonis vultum intueri$$ In their alarm they doubted whether this was a casual outbreak of the soldiers ,  or an act of treachery in the Emperor ,  and whether to remain and be arrested was a more perilous alternative than to disperse and fly At one time making a show of courage ,  at another betrayed by their terror ,  they still watched the countenance of Otho
 utque evenit inclinatis ad suspicionem mentibus , cum timeret Otho , timebatur$$ And ,  as it happened ,  so ready were all to suspect ,  Otho felt as much alarm as he inspired

 undique arma et minae , modo in centuriones tribunosque , modo in senatum universum , lymphatis caeco pavore animis , et quia neminem unum destinare irae poterant , licentiam in omnis poscentibus , donec Otho contra decus imperii toro insistens precibus et lacrimis aegre cohibuit , redieruntque in castra inviti neque innocentes$$ On every they brandished their swords ,  and menaced the centurions and tribunes at one moment ,  the whole Senate at another Their minds were maddened by a blind panic ,  and ,  unable to single out any one object for their fury ,  they sought for indiscriminate vengeance At last Otho ,  regardless of his imperial dignity ,  stood up on a couch ,  and by dint of prayers and tears contrived to restrain them

 deiecti in terram militum vultus ac plus tristitiae quam paenitentiae$$ The next day the houses were closed as they might be in a captured city

 tum Otho ingredi castra ausus$$ The end of these harangues was that 5000 sesterces were paid to each soldier
 atque illum tribuni centurionesque circumsistunt , abiectis militiae insignibus otium et salutem flagitantes$$ Then did Otho venture to enter the camp the tribunes and centurions surrounded him
 sensit invidiam miles et compositus in obsequium auctores seditionis ad supplicium ultro postulabat$$ They had thrown aside the insignia of their rank ,  and they demanded release from the toils and perils of service
 Otho , quamquam turbidis rebus et diversis militum animis , cum optimus quisque remedium praesentis licentiae posceret , vulgus et plures seditionibus et ambitioso imperio laeti per turbas et raptus facilius ad civile bellum impellerentur , simul reputans non posse principatum scelere quaesitum subita modestia et prisca gravitate retineri , sed discrimine urbis et periculo senatus anxius , postremo ita disseruit$$ Otho was aware how disturbed was the country ,  and how conflicting the feelings of the soldiery ,  the most respectable of whom cried out for some remedy for the existing licence ,  while the great mass delighted in riot and in an empire resting on popularity ,  and could be most easily urged to civil war by indulgence in tumult and rapine At the same time he reflected that power acquired by crime could not be retained by a sudden assumption of the moderation and of the dignity of former times ,  yet he was alarmed by the critical position of the capital and by the perils of the Senate
 neque ut adfectus vestros in amorem mei accenderem , commilitones , neque ut animum ad virtutem cohortarer (utraque enim egregie supersunt) , sed veni postulaturus a vobis temperamentum vestrae fortitudinis et erga me modum caritatis$$ Finally ,  he addressed the troops in these terms   Comrades ,  I am not come that I may move your hearts to love me ,  or that I may rouse your courage love and courage you have in superfluous abundance I am come to pray you to put some restraint on your valour ,  some check on your affection for me
 tumultus proximi initium non cupiditate vel odio , quae multos exercitus in discordiam egere , ac ne detrectatione quidem aut formidine periculorum$$ The origin of the late tumult is to be traced not to rapacity or disaffection ,  feelings which have driven many armies into civil strife ,  much less to any shrinking from ,  or fear of danger
 nimia pietas vestra acrius quam considerate excitavit$$ It was your excessive affection for me that roused you to act with more zeal than discretion
 nam saepe honestas rerum causas , ni iudicium adhibeas , perniciosi exitus consequuntur$$ For even honourable motives of action ,  unless directed by judgment ,  are followed by disastrous results
 imus ad bellum$$ We are now starting for a campaign
 num omnis nuntios palam audiri , omnia consilia cunctis praesentibus tractari ratio rerum aut occasionum velocitas patitur$$ Does the nature of things ,  does the rapid flight of opportunities ,  admit of all intelligence being publicly announced ,  of every plan being discussed in the presence of all
 tam nescire quaedam milites quam scire oportet$$ It is as needful that the soldiers should be ignorant of some things as that they should know others
 ita se ducum auctoritas , sic rigor disciplinae habet , ut multa etiam centuriones tribunosque tantum iuberi expediat$$ The general's authority ,  the stern laws of discipline ,  require that in many matters even the centurions and tribunes shall only receive orders
 si cur iubeantur quaerere singulis liceat , pereunte obsequio etiam imperium intercidit$$ If ,  whenever orders are given ,  individuals may ask questions ,  obedience ceases ,  and all command is at an end
 an et illic nocte intempesta rapientur arma$$ Will you in the field too snatch up your arms in the dead of night
 unus alterve perditus ac temulentus (neque enim pluris consternatione proxima insanisse crediderim) centurionis ac tribuni sanguine manus imbuet , imperatoris sui tentorium inrumpet$$ Shall one or two worthless and drunken fellows ,  for I cannot believe that more were carried away by the frenzy of the late outbreak ,  imbrue their hands in the blood of centurions and tribunes ,  and burst into the tent of their Emperor
 Et oratio ad perstringendos mulcendosque militum animos et severitatis modus (neque enim in pluris quam in duos animadverti iusserat) grate accepta compositique ad praesens qui coerceri non poterant$$ This speech ,  which was meant to touch and to calm the feelings of the soldiers ,  and the moderate amount of severity exercised (for Otho had ordered two and no more to be punished) ,  met with a grateful acceptance ,  and for the moment reduced to order men who could not be coerced
 non tamen quies urbi redierat$$ Yet tranquillity was not restored to the capital
 strepitus telorum et facies belli , et militibus ut nihil in commune turbantibus , ita sparsis per domos occulto habitu , et maligna cura in omnis , quos nobilitas aut opes aut aliqua insignis claritudo rumoribus obiecerat$$ there was still the din of arms and all the sights of war ,  and the soldiers ,  though they made no concerted disturbance ,  had dispersed themselves in disguise about private houses ,  and exercised a malignant surveillance over all whom exalted rank ,  or distinction of any kind ,  exposed to injurious reports
 Vitellianos quoque milites venisse in urbem ad studia partium noscenda plerique credebant$$ Many too believed that some of the soldiers of Vitellius had come to the capital to learn the feelings of the different parties
 unde plena omnia suspicionum et vix secreta domuum sine formidine$$ Hence everything was rife with suspicion ,  and even the privacy of the family was hardly exempt from fear
 sed plurimum trepidationis in publico , ut quemque nuntium fama attulisset , animum vultumque conversis , ne diffidere dubiis ac parum gaudere prosperis viderentur$$ It was however in public that most alarm was felt with every piece of intelligence that rumour brought ,  men changed their looks and spirits ,  anxious not to appear discouraged by unfavourable omens ,  or too little delighted by success
 coacto vero in curiam senatu arduus rerum omnium modus , ne contumax silentium , ne suspecta libertas$$ When the Senate was summoned to the Chamber ,  it was hard for them to maintain in all things a safe moderation
 et privato Othoni nuper atque eadem dicenti nota adulatio igitur versare sententias et huc atque illuc torquere , hostem et parricidam Vitellium vocantes , providentissimus quisque vulgaribus conviciis , quidam vera probra iacere , in clamore tamen et ubi plurimae voces , aut tumultu verborum sibi ipsi obstrepentes$$ Silence might seem contumacious ,  and frankness might provoke suspicion ,  and Otho ,  who had lately been a subject ,  and had used the same language ,  was familiar with flattery Accordingly ,  they discussed various motions on which they had put many constructions Vitellius they called a public enemy and a traitor to his country ,  the more prudent contenting themselves with hackneyed terms of abuse ,  though some threw out reproaches founded in truth ,  yet only did so in the midst of clamour ,  and when many voices were heard at once ,  drowning their own speech in a tumult of words
 Prodigia insuper terrebant diversis auctoribus vulgata$$ Prodigies which were now noised abroad from various sources increased men's terror
 investibulo Capitolii omissas habenas bigae , cui Victoria institerat , erupisse cella Iunonis maiorem humana speciem , statuam divi Iulii in insula Tiberini amnis sereno et immoto die ab occidente in orientem conversam , prolocutum in Etruria bovem , insolitos animalium partus , et plura alia rudibus saeculis etiam in pace observata , quae nunc tantum in metu audiuntur$$ It was said that in the porch of the Capitol the reins of the chariot ,  on which stood the goddess of Victory ,  had dropped from her hand ,  that from the chapel of Juno there had rushed forth a form greater than the form of man ,  that the statue of the Divine Julius ,  which stands on the island in the Tiber ,  had turned from the West to the East on a calm and tranquil day ,  that an ox had spoken aloud in Etruria ,  that strange births of animals had taken place ,  besides many other things ,  such as in barbarous ages are observed even during seasons of peace ,  but are now heard of only in times of terror
 sed praecipuus et cum praesenti exitio etiam futuri pavor subita inundatione Tiberis , qui immenso auctu proruto ponte sublicio ac strage obstantis molis refusus , non modo iacentia et plana urbis loca , sed secura eius modi casuum implevit$$ But an alarm greater than all ,  because it connected immediate loss with fears for the future ,  arose from a sudden inundation of the Tiber The river became vastly swollen ,  broke down the wooden bridge ,  was checked by the heap of ruins across the current ,  and overflowed not only the low and level districts of the capital ,  but also much that had been thought safe from such casualties

 utque primum vacuus a periculo animus fuit , id ipsum quod paranti expeditionem Othoni campus Martius et via Flaminia iter belli esset obstructum fortuitis vel naturalibus causis in prodigium et omen imminentium cladium vertebatur$$ When men's minds were no longer occupied by their fears ,  the fact ,  that while Otho was preparing for his campaign ,  the Campus Martius and the Via Flaminia ,  his route to the war ,  were obstructed by causes either fortuitous or natural ,  was regarded as a prodigy and an omen of impending disasters
 Otho lustrata urbe et expensis bello consiliis , quando Poeninae Cottiaeque Alpes et ceteri Galliarum aditus Vitellianis exercitibus claudebantur , Narbonensem Galliam adgredi statuit classe valida et partibus fida , quod reliquos caesorum ad pontem Mulvium et saevitia Galbae in custodia habitos in numeros legionis composuerat , facta et ceteris spe honoratae in posterum militiae$$ Otho ,  after publicly purifying the city and weighing various plans for the campaign ,  determined to march upon Gallia Narbonensis ,  as the passes of the Penine and Cottian Alps and all the other approaches to Gaul were held by the armies of Vitellius His fleet was strong and loyal to his cause ,  for he had enrolled in the ranks of the legion the survivors of the slaughter at the Milvian bridge ,  whom the stern policy of Galba had retained in custody ,  while to the rest he had held out hopes of a more honourable service for the future
 addidit classi urbanas cohortis et plerosque e praetorianis , viris et robur exercitus atque ipsis ducibus consilium et custodes$$ To the fleet he had added some city cohorts ,  and many of the Praetorians ,  the stay and strength of his army ,  who might at once advise and watch the generals

 Sepositus per eos dies Cornelius Dolabella in coloniam Aquinatem , neque arta custodia neque obscura , nullum ob crimen , sed vetusto nomine et propinquitate Galbae monstratus$$ About this time Cornelius Dolabella was banished to the Colonia Aquinas ,  but he was not kept in strict or secret custody it was not for any crime that he suffered he was marked out for suspicion by his ancient name and by his relationship to Galba
 multos e magistratibus , magnam consularium partem Otho non participes aut ministros bello , sed comitum specie secum expedire iubet , in quis et Lucium Vitellium , eodem quo ceteros cultu , nec ut imperatoris fratrem nec ut hostis$$ Many of the officers of state and a large proportion of the men of consular rank Otho ordered to accompany him to the field ,  not indeed to share or serve in the campaign ,  but to form a retinue Among them was Lucius Vitellius ,  whom Otho treated as he treated the rest ,  and not as though he were the brother either of an Emperor ,  or of an enemy

 nullus ordo metu aut periculo vacuus$$ no rank was free from apprehension or peril

 nec deerant e contrario qui amibitione stolida conspicua arma , insignis equos , quidam luxuriosos apparatus conviviorum et inritamenta libidinum ut instrumentum belli mercarentur$$ and the more they endeavoured to hide and repress their alarm the more evident was their terror On the other hand ,  there were some who with senseless ostentation purchased splendid arms and magnificent horses ,  and some who procured by way of equipments for the war the luxurious furniture of the banquet and other incentives to profligacy

 nam ex quo divus Augustus res Caesarum composuit , procul et in unius sollicitudinem aut decus populus Romanus bellaverat$$ Indeed from the time that the Divine Augustus consolidated the power of the Caesars ,  the wars of the Roman people had been in remote places ,  and had caused anxiety or brought honour to but one man

 mox vocata contione maiestatem urbis et consensum populi ac senatus pro se attollens , adversum Vitellianas partis modeste disseruit , inscitiam potius legionum quam audaciam increpans , nulla Vitellii mentione , sive ipsius ea moderatio , seu scriptor orationis sibi metuens contumeliis in Vitellium abstinuit , quando , ut in consiliis militiae Suetonio Paulino et Mario Celso , ita in rebus urbanis Galeri Trachali ingenio Othonem ut credebatur$$ Soon afterwards he summoned an assembly ,  and enlarged on the dignity of the capital and the unanimity of the Senate and people in his favour Of the party of Vitellius he spoke with moderation ,  charging the legions with ignorance rather than with crime ,  and making no mention of Vitellius himself This moderation was either his own ,  or was due to the writer of the speech ,  who ,  fearing for himself ,  abstained from invectives against Vitellius For Otho was believed to avail himself of the abilities of Galerius Trachalus in civil matters ,  just as he employed those of Celsus and Paullinus in war
 et erant qui genus ipsum orandi noscerent , crebro fori usu celebre et ad implendas populi auris latum et sonans$$ There were some who recognized the very style of speaking ,  which was well known from his constant pleading at the bar ,  and which sought to fill the popular ear with a copious and sonorous diction
 clamor vocesque vulgi ex more adulandi nimiae et falsae$$ The acclamations and cries which habitual flattery prompted in the people were at once extravagant and false
 quasi dictatorem Caesarem aut imperatorem Augustum prosequerentur , ita studiis votisque certabant , nec metu aut amore , sed ex libidine servitii$$ As if they were applauding a Dictator like Caesar ,  or an Emperor like Augustus ,  they vied with each other in their zeal and good wishes

 Titus Vespasianus , e Iudaea incolumi adhuc Galba missus a patre , causam profectionis officium erga principem et maturam petendis honoribus iuventam ferebat , sed vulgus fingendi avidum disperserat accitum in adoptionem$$ Titus Vespasian had been sent from Judaea by his father while Galba still lived ,  and alleged as a reason for his journey the homage due to the Emperor ,  and his age ,  which now qualified him to compete for office But the vulgar ,  ever eager to invent ,  had spread the report that he was sent for to be adopted
 materia sermonibus senium et orbitas principis et intemperantia civitatis , donec unus eligatur , multos destinandi$$ The advanced years and childless condition of the Emperor furnished matter for such gossip ,  and the country never can refrain from naming many persons until one be chosen
 augebat famam ipsius Titi ingenium quantaecumque fortunae capax , decor oris cum quadam maiestate , prosperae Vespasiani res , praesaga responsa , et inclinatis ad credendum animis loco ominum etiam fortuita$$ The report gained the more credit from the genius of Titus himself ,  equal as it was to the most exalted fortune ,  from the mingled beauty and majesty of his countenance ,  from the prosperous fortunes of Vespasian ,  from the prophetic responses of oracles ,  and even from accidental occurrences which ,  in the general disposition to belief ,  were accepted as omens
 ubi Corinthi , Achaiae urbe , certos nuntios accepit de interitu Galbae et aderant qui arma Vitellii bellumque adfirmarent , anxius animo paucis amicorum adhibitis cuncta utrimque perlustrat$$ At Corinth ,  the capital of Achaia ,  he received positive information of the death of Galba ,  and found men who spoke confidently of the revolt of Vitellius and of the fact of war In the anxiety of his mind ,  he sent a few of his friends ,  and carefully surveyed his position from both points of view
 si pergeret in urbem , nullam officii gratiam in alterius honorem suscepti , ac se Vitellio sive Othoni obsidem fore$$ He considered that if he should proceed to Rome ,  he should get no thanks for a civility intended for another ,  while his person would be a hostage in the hands either of Vitellius or of Otho
 sin rediret , offensam haud dubiam victoris , set incerta adhuc victoria et concedente in partis patre filium excusatum$$ that should he turn back ,  the conqueror would certainly be offended ,  but with the issue of the struggle still doubtful ,  and the father joining the party ,  the son would be excused
 sin Vespasianus rem publicam susciperet , obliviscendum offensarum de bello agitantibus$$ on the other hand ,  if Vespasian should assume the direction of the state ,  men who had to think of war would have to forget such causes of offence
 Conditorem templi regem Aeriam vetus memoria , quidam ipsius deae nomen id perhibent$$ The founder of the temple ,  according to old tradition ,  was king Aerias ,  though some represent this as the name of the goddess herself

 mox , ne honore nullo regium genus peregrinam stirpem antecelleret , ipsa quam intulerant scientia hospites cessere$$ Afterwards ,  that the royal family might not be without some superiority over the foreign stock ,  the strangers relinquished the craft which they had themselves introduced

 tres , ut supra memoravimus , ipsi Vespasiano legiones erant , exercitae bello$$ As we have mentioned above ,  Vespasian himself had three legions inured to war
 quattuor Mucianus obtinebat in pace , sed aemulatio et proximi exercitus gloria depulerat segnitiam , quantumque illis roboris discrimina et labor , tantum his vigoris addiderat integra quies et inexperti belli$$ Mucianus had four under his command in his peaceful province Emulation ,  however ,  and the glory won by the neighbouring army had banished all tendency to sloth ,  and unbroken rest and exemption from the hardships of war had given them a vigour equivalent to the hardihood which the others had gained by their perils and their toils
 Vespasianus acer militiae anteire agmen , locum castris capere , noctu diuque consilio ac , si res posceret , manu hostibus obniti , cibo fortuito , veste habituque vix a gregario milite discrepans$$ Vespasian was an energetic soldier he could march at the head of his army ,  choose the place for his camp ,  and bring by night and day his skill ,  or ,  if the occasion required ,  his personal courage to oppose the foe His food was such as chance offered

 Mucianum e contrario magnificentia et opes et cuncta privatum modum supergressa extollebant aptior sermone , dispositu provisuque civilium rerum peritus$$ in short ,  but for his avarice ,  he was equal to the generals of old Mucianus ,  on the contrary ,  was eminent for his magnificence ,  for his wealth ,  and for a greatness that transcended in all respects the condition of a subject

 ceterum hic Syriae , ille Iudaeae praepositus , vicinis provinciarum administrationibus invidia discordes , exitu demum Neronis positis odiis in medium consuluere , primum per amicos , dein praecipua concordiae fides Titus prava certamina communi utilitate aboleverat , natura atque arte compositus adliciendis etiam Muciani moribus$$ It would have been a rare combination of princely qualities ,  if ,  with their respective faults removed ,  their virtues only could have been united in one man Mucianus was governor of Syria ,  Vespasian of Judaea In the administration of these neighbouring provinces jealousy had produced discord between them ,  but on Nero's fall they had dropped their animosities and associated their counsels At first they communicated through friends ,  till Titus ,  who was the great bond of union between them ,  by representing their common interests had terminated their mischievous feud
 tribuni centurionesque et vulgus militum industria licentia , per virtutes per voluptates , ut cuique ingenium , adsciscebantur$$ He was indeed a man formed both by nature and by education to attract even such a character as that of Mucianus The tribunes ,  the centurions ,  and the common soldiers ,  were brought over to the cause by appeals to their energy or their love of license ,  to their virtues or to their vices ,  according to their different dispositions
 Antequam Titus adventaret sacramentum Othonis acceperat uterque exercitus , praecipitibus , ut adsolet , nuntiis et tarda mole civilis belli , quod longa concordia quietus Oriens tunc primum parabat$$ Long before the arrival of Titus ,  both armies had taken the oath of allegiance to Otho The news had come ,  as is usual ,  with great speed ,  while there was much to delay the gigantic undertaking of a civil war ,  for which the East after a long period of repose was then for the first time preparing

 mox , ut Othonem ac Vitellium scelestis armis res Romanas raptum ire vulgatum est , ne penes ceteros imperii praemia , penes ipsos tantum servitii necessitas esset , fremere miles et viris suas circumspicere$$ But when it became notorious that Otho and Vitellius ,  opposed in impious strife ,  were ready to make a spoil of the Empire ,  the thought that others would engross the rewards of power ,  while they would have nothing left for themselves but a compulsory submission ,  made the soldiers murmur and take a survey of their own strength

 trucidati et comites$$ His associates were slaughtered with him
 capita ut hostium ipsi interfectores ad Othonem tulere$$ The perpetrators of the deed carried the heads of the slain to Otho ,  as being the heads of public enemies

 inritabat quin etiam Batavos transrhenanosque Padus ipse , quem repente contra Placentiam transgressi raptis quibusdam exploratoribus ita ceteros terruere ut adesse omnem Caecinae exercitum trepidi ac falsi nuntiarent$$ The very sight of the Padus excited the men from Batavia and the Transrhenane provinces Crossing the stream by a sudden movement ,  they advanced on Placentia ,  and seizing some reconnoiterers so terrified the rest ,  that ,  deceived by their alarm ,  they announced that the whole army of Caecina was at hand
 Certum erat Spurinnae (is enim Placentiam optinebat) necdum venisse Caecinam et , si propinquaret , coercere intra munimenta militem nec tris praetorias cohortis et mille vexillarios cum paucis equitibus veterano exercitui obicere sed indomitus miles et belli ignarus correptis signis vexillisque ruere et retinenti duci tela intentare , spretis centurionibus tribunisque quin prodi Othonem et accitum Caecinam clamitabant$$ Spurinna ,  who now held Placentia ,  was sure that Caecina had not yet arrived ,  and that ,  even were he approaching ,  he ought to keep his men within their fortifications ,  and not confront a veteran army with three Praetorian cohorts ,  a thousand veterans ,  and a handful of cavalry But the undisciplined and inexperienced soldiery seized their standards and colours ,  and rushed to the attack ,  brandishing their weapons in the face of their general when he sought to restrain them ,  and spurning from them the tribunes and centurions ,  and even crying out that Otho was betrayed and that Caecina had come by invitation
 fit temeritatis alienae comes Spurinna , primo coactus , mox velle simulans , quo plus auctoritatis inesset consiliis si seditio mitesceret$$ Spurinna associated himself with the rash movement which others had originated ,  at first acting under compulsion ,  but afterwards pretending to consent ,  in the hope that his counsels might have more influence should the mutinous spirit abate

 iamque totis castris modesti sermones , et inserentibus se centurionibus tribunisque laudari providentia ducis quod coloniam virium et opum validam robur ac sedem bello legisset$$ By this time more temperate language was heard throughout the camp ,  and the tribunes and centurions ,  mixing with the troops ,  suggested commendations of the prudence of their general in selecting for the rallying point and basis of his operations a colony rich in military strength and resources
 ipse postremo Spurinna , non tam culpam exprobrans quam rationem ostendens , relictis exploratoribus ceteros Placentiam reduxit minus turbidos et imperia accipientis$$ Finally ,  Spurinna himself ,  not so much reproaching them with their error as exposing it by his arguments ,  conducted them all back to Placentia ,  except some scouts whom he left ,  in a less turbulent temper and more amenable to command
 solidati muri , propugnacula addita , auctae turres , provisa parataque non arma modo sed obsequium et parendi amor , quod solum illis partibus defuit , cum virtutis haud paeniteret$$ The walls were strengthened ,  battlements were added ,  and the towers were raised in height It was not only of the implements of war that provision and preparation were made ,  but of the spirit of subordination and the love of obedience
 At Caecina , velut relicta post Alpis saevitia ac licentia , modesto agmine per Italiam incessit$$ Caecina ,  who seemed to have left his cruelty and profligacy on the other side of the Alps ,  advanced through Italy with his army under excellent discipline
 ornatum ipsius municipia et coloniae in superbiam trahebant , quod versicolori sagulo , bracas barbarum tecgmen indutus togatos adloqueretur$$ The towns and colonies ,  however ,  found indications of a haughty spirit in the general's dress ,  when they saw the cloak of various colours ,  and the trews ,  a garment of foreign fashion ,  clothed in which he was wont to speak to their toga-clad citizens
 uxorem quoque eius Saloninam , quamquam in nullius iniuriam insignis equo ostroque veheretur , tamquam laesi gravabantur , insita mortalibus natura recentem aliorum felicitatem acribus oculis introspicere modumque fortunae a nullis magis exigere quam quos in aequo viderunt$$ And they resented ,  as if with a sense of personal wrong ,  the conduct of his wife Salonina ,  though it injured no one that she presented a conspicuous figure as she rode through their towns on horseback in a purple habit They were acting on the instincts of human nature ,  which prompt men to scrutinize with keen eyes the recent elevation of their fellows ,  and to demand a temperate use of prosperity from none more rigorously than from those whom they have seen on a level with themselves
 Caecina Padum transgressus , temptata Othonianorum fide per conloquium et promissa , isdem petitus , postquam pax et concordia speciosis et inritis nominibus iactata sunt , consilia curasque in obpugnationem Placentiae magno terrore vertit , gnarus ut initia belli provenissent famam in cetera fore$$ Caecina ,  after crossing the Padus ,  sought to tamper with the loyalty of the Othonianists at a conference in which he held out hopes of reward ,  and he was himself assailed with the same arts After the specious but meaningless names of peace and concord had been thus bandied to and fro ,  Caecina turned all his thoughts and plans on the capture of Placentia ,  making a formidable show of preparation ,  as he knew that according to the success of his opening operations would be the subsequent prestige of his arms
 Sed primus dies impetu magis quam veterani exercitus artibus transactus$$ The first day ,  however ,  was spent in a furious onset rather than in the skilful approaches of a veteran army
 aperti incautique muros subiere , cibo vinoque praegraves$$ Exposed and reckless ,  the troops came close under the walls ,  stupefied by excess in food and wine
 in eo certamine pulcherrimum amphitheatri opus , situm extra muros , conflagravit , sive ab obpugnatoribus incensum , dum faces et glandis et missilem ignem in obsessos iaculantur , sive ab obsessis , dum regerunt$$ In this struggle the amphitheatre ,  a most beautiful building ,  situated outside the walls ,  was burnt to the ground ,  possibly set on fire by the assailants ,  while they showered brands ,  fireballs ,  and ignited missiles ,  on the besieged ,  possibly by the besieged themselves ,  while they discharged incessant volleys in return
 municipale vulgus , pronum ad suspiciones , fraude inlata ignis alimenta credidit a quibusdam ex vicinis coloniis invidia et aemulatione , quod nulla in Italia moles tam capax foret$$ The populace of the town ,  always inclined to be suspicious ,  believed that combustibles had been purposely introduced into the building by certain persons from the neighbouring colonies ,  who viewed it with envious and jealous eyes ,  because there was not in Italy another building so capacious
 quocumque casu accidit , dum atrociora metuebantur , in levi habitum , reddita securitate , tamquam nihil gravius pati potuissent , maerebant$$ Whatever the cause of the accident ,  it was thought of but little moment as long as more terrible disasters were apprehended

 et Caecina pudore coeptae temere obpugnationis , ne inrisus ac vanus isdem castris adsideret , traiecto rursus Pado Cremonam petere intendit$$ Caecina ,  ashamed of the assault on which he had so rashly ventured ,  and unwilling ,  ridiculed and baffled as he was ,  to remain in the same position ,  again crossed the Padus ,  and resolved on marching to Cremona

 pulsus Placentia , caesis nuper auxiliis , etiam per concursum exploratorum , crebra magis quam digna memoratu proelia , inferior , propinquante Fabio Valente , ne omne belli decus illuc concederet , reciperare gloriam avidius quam consultius properabat$$ He had been repulsed from Placentia his auxiliaries had been recently cut up ,  and even when the skirmishers had met in a series of actions ,  frequent indeed ,  but not worth relating ,  he had been worsted and now that Valens was coming up ,  fearful that all the distinctions of the campaign would centre in that general ,  he made a hasty attempt to retrieve his credit ,  but with more impetuosity than prudence
 ad duodecimum a Cremona (locus Castorum vocatur) ferocissimos auxiliarium imminentibus viae lucis occultos componit$$ Twelve miles from Cremona (at a place called the Castors) he posted some of the bravest of his auxiliaries ,  concealed in the woods that there overhang the road

 protrita hostium acie versi in fugam etiam qui subveniebant$$ The enemy's line was completely crushed ,  and the reinforcements who were coming up to their aid were also put to flight

 orta et in castris seditio quod non universi ducerentur$$ Besides this ,  a mutiny broke out in the camp because the whole army was not led into action

 ceterum ea ubique formido fuit apud fugientis occursantis , in acie pro vallo , ut deleri cum universo exercitu Caecinam potuisse , ni Suetonius Paulinus receptui cecinisset , utrisque in partibus percrebruerit$$ In fact such was the panic everywhere ,  among the fugitives and among the troops coming up ,  in the lines and in front of the entrenchments ,  that it was very commonly said on both sides ,  that Caecina and his whole army might have been destroyed ,  had not Suetonius Paullinus given the signal of recall
 timuisse se Paulinus ferebat tantum insuper laboris atque itineris , ne Vitellianus miles recens e castris fessos adgrederetur et perculsis nullum retro subsidium foret$$ Paullinus alleged that he feared the effects of so much additional toil and so long a march ,  apprehending that the Vitellianists might issue fresh from their camp ,  and attack his wearied troops ,  who ,  once thrown into confusion ,  would have no reserves to fall back upon
 apud paucos ea ducis ratio probata , in vulgus adverso rumore fuit$$ A few approved the general's policy ,  but it was unfavourably canvassed by the army at large
 Haud proinde id damnum Vitellianos in metum compulit quam ad modestiam composuit$$ The effect of this disaster on the Vitellianists was not so much to drive them to fear as to draw them to obedience
 nec solum apud Caecinam , qui culpam in militem conferebat seditioni magis quam proelio paratum$$ Nor was this the case only among the troops of Caecina ,  who indeed laid all the blame upon his soldiers ,  more ready ,  as he said ,  for mutiny than for battle
 Fabii quoque Valentis copiae (iam enim Ticinum venerat) posito hostium contemptu et reciperandi decoris cupidine reverentius et aequalius duci parebant$$ The forces also of Fabius Valens ,  who had now reached Ticinum ,  laid aside their contempt for the enemy ,  and anxious to retrieve their credit began to yield a more respectful and uniform obedience to their general
 gravis alioquin seditio exarserat , quam altiore initio (neque enim rerum a Caecina gestarum ordinem interrumpi oportuerat) repetam$$ A serious mutiny ,  however ,  had raged among them ,  of which ,  as it was not convenient to interrupt the orderly narrative of Caecina's operations ,  I shall take up the history at an earlier period
 cohortes Batavorum , quas bello Neronis a quarta decima legione digressas , cum Britanniam peterent , audito Vitellii motu in civitate Lingonum Fabio Valenti adiunctas rettulimus , superbe agebant , ut cuiusque legionis tentoria accessissent , coercitos a se quartadecimanos , ablatam Neroni Italiam atque omnem belli fortunam in ipsorum manu sitam iactantes$$ I have already described how the Batavian cohorts who separated from the 14th legion during the Neronian war ,  hearing on their way to Britain of the rising of Vitellius ,  joined Fabius Valens in the country of the Lingones They behaved themselves insolently ,  boasting ,  as they visited the quarters of the several legions ,  that they had mastered the men of the 14th ,  that they had taken Italy from Nero ,  that the whole destiny of the war lay in their hands
 contumeliosum id militibus , acerbum duci$$ Such language was insulting to the soldiers ,  and offensive to the general
 corrupta iurgiis aut rixis disciplina$$ The discipline of the army was relaxed by the brawls and quarrels which ensued
 ad postremum Valens e petulantia etiam perfidiam suspectabat$$ At last Valens began to suspect that insolence would end in actual treachery
 Igitur nuntio adlato pulsam Trevirorum alam Tungrosque a classe Othonis et Narbonensem Galliam circumiri , simul cura socios tuendi et militari astu cohortis turbidas ac , si una forent , praevalidas dispergendi , partem Batavorum ire in subsidium iubet$$ When ,  therefore ,  intelligence reached him that the cavalry of the Treveri and the Tungrian infantry had been defeated by Otho's fleet ,  and that Gallia Narbonensis was blockaded ,  anxious at once to protect a friendly population ,  and ,  like a skilful soldier ,  to separate cohorts so turbulent and ,  while they remained united ,  so inconveniently strong ,  he directed a detachment of the Batavians to proceed to the relief of the province
 quod ubi auditum vulgatumque , maerere socii , fremere legiones$$ This having been heard and become generally known ,  the allies were discontented and the legions murmured
 orbari se fortissimorum virorum auxilio$$ We are being deprived ,  they said ,  of the help of our bravest men
 veteres illos et tot bellorum victores , postquam in conspectu sit hostis , velut ex acie abduci$$ Those veteran troops victorious in so many campaigns ,  now that the enemy is in sight ,  are withdrawn ,  so to speak ,  from the very field of battle
 si provincia urbe et salute imperii potior sit , omnes illuc sequerentur sin victoriae sanitas sustentaculum columen in Italia verteretur , non abrumpendos ut corpori validissimos artus$$ If indeed a province be of more importance than the capital and the safety of the Empire ,  let us all follow them thither ,  but if the reality ,  the support ,  the mainstay of success ,  centre in Italy ,  you must not tear ,  as it were ,  from a body its very strongest limbs
 Haec ferociter iactando , postquam immissis lictoribus Valens coercere seditionem coeptabat , ipsum invadunt , saxa iaciunt , fugientem sequuntur$$ In the midst of these fierce exclamations ,  Valens ,  sending his lictors into the crowd ,  attempted to quell the mutiny On this they attacked the general himself ,  hurled stones at him ,  and ,  when he fled ,  pursued him
 spolia Galliarum et Viennensium aurum , pretia laborum suorum , occultare clamitantes , direptis sarcinis tabernacula ducis ipsamque humum pilis et lanceis rimabantur$$ Crying out that he was concealing the spoil of Gaul ,  the gold of the men of Vienna ,  the hire of their own toils ,  they ransacked his baggage ,  and probed with javelins and lances the walls of the general's tent and the very ground beneath
 nam Valens servili veste apud decurionem equitum tegebatur$$ Valens ,  disguised in the garb of a slave ,  found concealment with a subaltern officer of cavalry
 tum Alfenus Varus praefectus castrorum , deflagrante paulatim seditione , addit consilium , vetitis obire vigilias centurionibus , omisso tubae sono , quo miles ad belli munia cietur$$ After this ,  Alfenius Varus ,  prefect of the camp ,  seeing that the mutiny was gradually subsiding ,  promoted the reaction by the following device He forbade the centurions to visit the sentinels ,  and discontinued the trumpet calls by which the troops are summoned to their usual military duties
 igitur torpere cuncti , circumspectare inter se attoniti et id ipsum quod nemo regeret paventes$$ Thereupon all stood paralysed ,  and gazed at each other in amazement ,  panic-stricken by the very fact that there was no one to direct them
 silentio , patientia , postremo precibus ac lacrimis veniam quaerebant$$ By their silence ,  by their submission ,  finally by their tears and entreaties ,  they craved forgiveness
 ut vero deformis et flens et praeter spem incolumis Valens processit , gaudium miseratio favor$$ But when Valens ,  thus unexpectedly preserved ,  came forward in sad plight ,  shedding tears ,  they were moved to joy ,  to pity ,  even to affection
 versi in laetitiam , ut est vulgus utroque immodicum , laudantes gratantesque circumdatum aquilis signisque in tribunal ferunt$$ Their revulsion to delight was just that of a mob ,  always extreme in either emotion They greeted him with praises and congratulations ,  and surrounding him with the eagles and standards ,  carried him to the tribunal
 ille utili moderatione non supplicium cuiusquam poposcit , ac ne dissimulans suspectior foret , paucos incusavit , gnarus civilibus bellis plus militibus quam ducibus licere$$ With a politic prudence he refrained from demanding capital punishment in any case yet ,  fearing that he might lay himself more open to suspicion by concealment of his feelings ,  he censured a few persons ,  well aware that in civil wars the soldiers have more license than the generals
 Munientibus castra apud Ticinum de adversa Caecinae pugna adlatum , et prope renovata seditio tamquam fraude et cunctationibus Valentis proelio defuissent$$ While they were fortifying a camp at Ticinum ,  the news of Caecina's defeat reached them ,  and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh from an impression that underhand dealing and delay on the part of Valens had kept them away from the battle
 nolle requiem , non expectare ducem , anteire signa , urgere signiferos$$ They refused all rest they would not wait for their general
 rapido agmine Caecinae iunguntur$$ they advanced in front of the standards ,  and hurried on the standard-bearers
 improspera Valentis fama apud exercitum Caecinae erat$$ After a rapid march they joined Caecina
 expositos se tanto pauciores integris hostium viribus querebantur , simul in suam excusationem et adventantium robur per adulationem attollentes , ne ut victi et ignavi despectarentur$$ The character of Valens did not stand well with Caecina's army They complained that ,  though so much weaker in numbers ,  they had been exposed to the whole force of the enemy ,  thus at once excusing themselves ,  and extolling ,  in the implied flattery ,  the strength of the new arrivals ,  who might ,  they feared ,  despise them as beaten and spiritless soldiers
 et quamquam plus virium , prope duplicatus legionum auxiliorumque numerus erat Valenti , studia tamen militum in Caecinam inclinabant , super benignitatem animi , qua promptior habebatur , etiam vigore aetatis , proceritate corporis et quodam inani favore$$ Though Valens had the stronger army ,  nearly double the number of legions and auxiliaries ,  yet the partialities of the soldiers inclined to Caecina ,  not only from the geniality of heart ,  which he was thought more ready to display ,  but even from his vigorous age ,  his commanding person ,  and a certain superficial attractiveness which he possessed
 hinc aemulatio ducibus$$ The result was a jealousy between the two generals
 Caecina ut foedum ac maculosum , ille ut tumidum ac vanum inridebant$$ Caecina ridiculed his colleague as a man of foul and infamous character
 sed condito odio eandem utilitatem fovere , crebris epistulis sine respectu veniae probra Othoni obiectantes , cum duces partium Othonis quamvis uberrima conviciorum in Vitellium materia abstinerent$$ Valens retorted with charges of emptiness and vanity But concealing their enmity ,  they devoted themselves to their common interest ,  and in frequent letters ,  without any thought of pardon ,  heaped all manner of charges upon Otho ,  while the Othonianist generals ,  though they had the most abundant materials for invective against Vitellius ,  refrained from employing them
 Sane ante utriusque exitum , quo egregiam Otho famam , Vitellius flagitiosissimam meruere , minus Vitellii ignavae voluptates quam Othonis flagrantissimae libidines timebantur$$ In fact ,  before the death of these two men (and it was by his death that Otho gained high renown ,  as Vitellius incurred by his the foulest infamy) ,  Vitellius with his indolent luxury was less dreaded than Otho with his ardent passions The murder of Galba had made the one terrible and odious ,  while no one reckoned against the other the guilt of having begun the war
 addiderat huic terrorem atque odium caedes Galbae , contra illi initium belli nemo imputabat$$ Vitellius with his sensuality and gluttony was his own enemy Otho ,  with his profligacy ,  his cruelty ,  and his recklessness ,  was held to be more dangerous to the Commonwealth
 Vitellius ventre et gula sibi inhonestus , Otho luxu saevitia audacia rei publicae exitiosior ducebatur$$ When Caecina and Valens had united their forces ,  the Vitellianists had no longer any reason to delay giving battle with their whole strength Otho deliberated as to whether protracting the war or risking an engagement were the better course
 Coniunctis Caecinae ac Valentis copiis nulla ultra penes Vitellianos mora quin totis viribus certarent Otho consultavit trahi bellum an fortunam experiri placeret$$ Then Suetonius Paullinus ,  thinking that it befitted his reputation ,  which was such that no one at that period was looked upon as a more skilful soldier ,  to give an opinion on the whole conduct of the war ,  contended that impatience would benefit the enemy ,  while delay would serve their own cause
 Tunc Suetonius Paulinus dignum fama sua ratus , qua nemo illa tempestate militaris rei callidior habebatur , de toto genere belli censere , festinationem hostibus , moram ipsis utilem disseruit$$ The entire army of Vitellius ,  he said ,  has already arrived Nor have they much strength in their rear ,  since Gaul is ready to rise ,  and to abandon the banks of the Rhine ,  when such hostile tribes are ready to burst in ,  would not answer his purpose
 exercitum Vitellii universum advenisse , nec multum virium a tergo , quoniam Galliae tumeant et deserere Rheni ripam inrupturis tam infestis nationibus non conducat$$ A hostile people and an intervening sea keep from him the army of Britain Spain is not over full of troops Gallia Narbonensis has been cowed by the attack of our ships and by a defeat
 Britannicum militem hoste et mari distineri$$ Italy beyond the Padus is shut in by the Alps ,  cannot be relieved from the sea ,  and has been exhausted by the passage of his army
 Hispanias armis non ita redundare$$ For that army there is no where any corn ,  and without supplies an army cannot be kept together
 provinciam Narbonensem incursu classis et adverso proelio contremuisse clausam Alpibus et nullo maris subsidio transpadanam Italiam atque ipso transitu exercitus vastam$$ Then the Germans ,  the most formidable part of the enemy's forces ,  should the war be protracted into the summer ,  will sink with enfeebled frames under the change of country and climate
 non frumentum usquam exercitui , nec exercitum sine copiis retineri posse$$ Many a war ,  formidable in its first impetuosity ,  has passed into nothing through the weariness of delay
 iam Germanos , quod genus militum apud hostis atrocissimum sit , tracto in aestatem bello , fluxis corporibus , mutationem soli caelique haud toleraturos multa bella impetu valida per taedia et moras evanuisse$$ We ,  on the other hand ,  have on all sides abundant resources and loyal adherents We have Pannonia ,  Moesia ,  Dalmatia ,  the East with its armies yet intact ,  we have Italy and Rome ,  the capital of the Empire ,  the Senate ,  and the people ,  names that never lose their splendour ,  though they may sometimes be eclipsed
 contra ipsis omnia opulenta et fida , Pannoniam Moesiam Dalmatiam Orientem cum integris exercitibus , Italiam et caput rerum urbem senatumque et populum , numquam obscura nomina , etiam si aliquando obumbrentur$$ We have the wealth of the State and of private individuals We have a vast supply of money ,  which in a civil war is a mightier weapon than the sword Our soldiers are inured to the climate of Italy or to yet greater heat
 publicas privatasque opes et immensam pecuniam , inter civilis discordias ferro validiorem$$ We have the river Padus on our front ,  and cities strongly garrisoned and fortified ,  none of which will surrender to the enemy ,  as the defence of Placentia has proved
 corpora militum aut Italiae sueta aut aestibus$$ Let Otho therefore protract the war
 obiacere flumen Padum , tutas viris murisque urbis , e quibus nullam hosti cessuram Placentiae defensione exploratum$$ In a few days the 14th legion ,  itself highly renowned ,  will arrive with the troops from Moesia
 proinde duceret bellum$$ He may then again consider the question ,  and should a battle be resolved on ,  we shall fight with increased strength
 Accedebat sententiae Paulini Marius Celsus$$ Marius Celsus acquiesced in the opinion of Paullinus
 idem placere Annio Gallo , paucos ante dies lapsu equi adflicto , missi qui consilium eius sciscitarentur rettulerant$$ and Annius Gallus ,  who a few days before had been seriously injured by the fall of his horse ,  was reported to agree by those who had been sent to ascertain his opinion
 Otho pronus ad decertandum$$ Otho was inclined to risk a decisive battle
 frater eius Titianus et praefectus praetorii Proculus , imperitia properantes , fortunam et deos et numen Othonis adesse consiliis , adfore conatibus testabantur , neu quis obviam ire sententiae auderet , in adulationem concesserant$$ His brother Titianus ,  and Proculus ,  the prefect of the Praetorian Guard ,  ignorant and therefore impatient ,  declared that fortune ,  the Gods ,  and the genius of Otho ,  were with their counsels ,  and would be with their enterprises That no one might dare to oppose their views ,  they had taken refuge in flattery
 postquam pugnari placitum , interesse pugnae imperatorem an seponi melius foret dubitavere$$ It having been resolved to give battle ,  it became a question whether it would be better for the Emperor to be present in person ,  or to withdraw
 Paulino et Celso iam non adversantibus , ne principem obiectare periculis viderentur idem illi deterioris consilii auctores perpulere ut Brixellum concederet ac dubiis proeliorum exemptus summae rerum et imperii se ipsum reservaret$$ Paullinus and Celsus no longer opposed ,  for they would not seem to put the Emperor in the way of peril ,  and these same men who suggested the baser policy prevailed on him to retire to Brixellum ,  and thus secure from the hazards of the field ,  to reserve himself for the administration of empire
 is primus dies Othonianas partis adflixit$$ That day first gave the death-blow to the party of Otho
 namque et cum ipso praetoriarum cohortium et speculatorum equitumque valida manus discessit , et remanentium fractus animus , quando suspecti duces et Otho , cui uni apud militem fides , dum et ipse non nisi militibus credit , imperia ducum in incerto reliquerat$$ Not only did a strong detachment of the Praetorian cohorts ,  of the bodyguard ,  and of the cavalry ,  depart with him ,  but the spirit of those who remained was broken ,  for the men suspected their generals ,  and Otho ,  who alone had the confidence of the soldiers ,  while he himself trusted in none but them ,  had left the generals' authority on a doubtful footing
 Nihil eorum Vitellianos fallebat , crebris , ut in civili bello , transfugiis et exploratores cura diversa sciscitandi sua non occultabant$$ Nothing of this escaped the Vitellianists ,  for ,  as is usual in civil wars ,  there were many deserters ,  and the spies ,  while busy in inquiring into the plans of the enemy ,  failed to conceal their own
 quieti intentique Caecina ac Valens , quando hostis imprudentia rueret , quod loco sapientiae est , alienam stultitiam opperiebantur , inchoato ponte transitum Padi simulantes adversus obpositam gladiatorum manum , ac ne ipsorum miles segne otium tereret$$ Meanwhile Caecina and Valens remained quiet ,  and watched intently for the moment when the enemy in his blindness should rush upon destruction ,  and found the usual substitute for wisdom in waiting for the folly of others They began to form a bridge ,  making a feint of crossing the Padus ,  in the face of an opposing force of gladiators
 naves pari inter se spatio , validis utrimque trabibus conexae , adversum in flumen dirigebantur , iactis super ancoris quae firmitatem pontis continerent , sed ancorarum funes non extenti fluitabant , ut augescente flumine inoffensus ordo navium attolleretur claudebat pontem imposita turris et in extremam navem educta , unde tormentis ac machinis hostes propulsarentur$$ they wished also to keep their own soldiers from passing their unoccupied time in idleness Boats were ranged at equal distances from each other ,  connected at both ends by strong beams ,  and with their heads turned against the current ,  while anchors were thrown out above to keep the bridge firm The cables ,  however ,  instead of being taut ,  hung loose in the water ,  in order that as the stream rose the vessels might rise without their arrangement being disturbed On the end of the bridge was placed a turret
 Othoniani in ripa turrim struxerant saxaque et faces iaculabantur$$ it was built out on the last boat ,  and from it engines and machines might be worked to repel the enemy
 Et erat insula amne medio , in quam gladiatores navibus molientes , Germani nando praelabebantur$$ In the middle of the river was an island While the gladiators were making their way to it in boats ,  the Germans swam and outstripped them
 ac forte pluris transgressos completis Liburnicis per promptissimos gladiatorum Macer adgreditur$$ A considerable number ,  as it chanced ,  had effected the passage ,  when Macer ,  having manned some light gallies ,  attacked them with the most active of his gladiators
 sed neque ea constantia gladiatoribus ad proelia quae militibus , nec proinde nutantes e navibus quam stabili gradu e ripa vulnera derigebant$$ But the gladiator has not in battle the firmness of the regular soldier ,  and now ,  as they stood on rocking vessels ,  they could not direct their blows like men who had a sure footing on land
 et cum variis trepidantium inclinationibus mixti remiges propugnatoresque turbarentur , desilire in vada ultro Germani , retentare puppis , scandere foros aut comminus mergere$$ As the men in their alarm made confused movements ,  rowers and combatants were mingled together in disorder upon this ,  the Germans themselves leapt into the shallows ,  laid hold of the boats ,  climbed over the gunwales ,  or sank them with their hands
 quae cuncta in oculis utriusque exercitus quanto laetiora Vitellianis , tanto acrius Othoniani causam auctoremque cladis detestabantur$$ All this passed in the sight of both armies ,  and the more it delighted the Vitellianists ,  the more vehemently did the Othonianists curse the cause and author of the disaster
 Et proelium quidem , abruptis quae supererant navibus , fuga diremptum$$ The conflict was terminated by the flight of the vanquished ,  who carried off what boats were left
 Macer ad exitium poscebatur , iamque vulneratum eminus lancea strictis gladiis invaserant , cum intercursu tribunorum centurionumque protegitur$$ Then they cried out for the execution of Macer He had been wounded by a javelin thrown from a distance ,  and the soldiers had made a rush upon him with drawn swords ,  when he was saved by the interference of the tribunes and centurions
 nec multo post Vestricius Spurinna iussu Othonis , relicto Placentiae modico praesidio , cum cohortibus subvenit$$ Soon after Vestricius Spurinna ,  having received orders to that effect from Otho ,  joined with his cohorts ,  leaving but a moderate force in garrison at Placentia
 dein Flavium Sabinum consulem designatum Otho rectorem copiis misit , quibus Macer praefuerat , laeto milite ad mutationem ducum et ducibus ob crebras seditiones tam infestam militiam aspernantibus$$ After this Otho sent Flavius Sabinus ,  consul elect ,  to take the command of the troops which had been under Macer the soldiers were delighted by this change of generals ,  while the generals were led by these continual outbreaks to regard with disgust so hateful a service
 Invenio apud quosdam auctores pavore belli seu fastidio utriusque principis , quorum flagitia ac dedecus apertiore in dies fama noscebantur , dubitasse exercitus num posito certamine vel ipsi in medium consultarent , vel senatui permitterent legere imperatorem , atque eo duces Othonianos spatium ac moras suasisse , praecipua spe Paulini , quod vetustissimus consularium et militia clarus gloriam nomenque Britannicis expeditionibus meruisset$$ I find it stated by some authors that either the dread of or the disgust felt for both Emperors ,  whose wickedness and infamy were coming out every day into more open notoriety ,  made the two armies hesitate whether they should not cease their strife ,  and either themselves consult together ,  or allow the Senate to choose an Emperor and that ,  for this reason ,  Otho's generals recommended a certain measure of delay ,  Paullinus especially entertaining hopes for himself ,  on the ground that he was the senior among the men of consular rank ,  that he was well known as a soldier ,  and had attained great distinction and fame by his campaigns in Britain
 ego ut concesserim apud paucos tacito voto quietem pro discordia , bonum et innocentem principem pro pessimis ac flagitiosissimis expetitum , ita neque Paulinum , qua prudentia fuit , sperasse corruptissimo saeculo tantam vulgi moderationem reor ut qui pacem belli amore turbaverant , bellum pacis caritate deponerent , neque aut exercitus linguis moribusque dissonos in hunc consensum potuisse coalescere , aut legatos ac duces magna ex parte luxus egestatis scelerum sibi conscios nisi pollutum obstrictumque meritis suis principem passuros$$ Though I would allow that there were some few who in their secret wishes prayed for peace in the stead of disorder ,  for a worthy and blameless Emperor in the room of men utterly worthless and wicked ,  yet I cannot suppose that Paullinus ,  wise as he was ,  could have hoped in an age thoroughly depraved to find such moderation in the common herd ,  as that men ,  who in their passion for war had trampled peace under foot ,  should now in their affection for peace renounce the charms of war nor can I think that armies differing in language and in character ,  could have united in such an agreement or that lieutenants and generals ,  who were for the most part burdened by the consciousness of profligacy ,  of poverty ,  and of crime ,  could have endured any Emperor who was not himself stained by vice ,  as well as bound by obligation to themselves
 Vetus ac iam pridem insita mortalibus potentiae cupido cum imperii magnitudine adolevit erupitque$$ That old passion for power which has been ever innate in man increased and broke out as the Empire grew in greatness
 nam rebus modicis aequalitas facile habebatur$$ In a state of moderate dimensions equality was easily preserved
 sed ubi subacto orbe et aemulis urbibus regibusve excisis securas opes concupiscere vacuum fuit , prima inter patres plebemque certamina exarsere$$ but when the world had been subdued ,  when all rival kings and cities had been destroyed ,  and men had leisure to covet wealth which they might enjoy in security ,  the early conflicts between the patricians and the people were kindled into flame
 modo turbulenti tribuni , modo consules praevalidi , et in urbe ac foro temptamenta civilium bellorum$$ At one time the tribunes were factious ,  at another the consuls had unconstitutional power
 mox e plebe infima Gaius Marius et nobilium saevissimus Lucius Sulla victam armis libertatem in dominationem verterunt$$ it was in the capital and the forum that we first essayed civil wars Then rose C Marius ,  sprung from the very dregs of the populace ,  and L
 post quos Gnaeus Pompeius occultior non melior , et numquam postea nisi de principatu quaesitum$$ Sulla ,  the most ruthless of the patricians ,  who perverted into absolute dominion the liberty which had yielded to their arms
 non discessere ab armis in Pharsalia ac Philippis civium legiones , nedum Othonis ac Vitellii exercitus sponte posituri bellum fuerint$$ After them came Cn Pompeius ,  with a character more disguised but no way better Henceforth men's sole object was supreme power
 eadem illos deum ira , eadem hominum rabies , eaedem scelerum causae in discordiam egere$$ Legions formed of Roman citizens did not lay down their arms at Pharsalia and Philippi ,  much less were the armies of Otho and Vitellius likely of their own accord to abandon their strife
 quod singulis velut ictibus transacta sunt bella , ignavia principum factum est$$ They were driven into civil war by the same wrath from heaven ,  the same madness among men ,  the same incentives to crime
 sed me veterum novorumque morum reputatio longius tulit$$ That these wars were terminated by what we may call single blows ,  was owing to want of energy in the chiefs
 nunc ad rerum ordinem venio$$ But these reflections on the character of ancient and modern times have carried me too far from my subject
 Non ut ad pugnam sed ad bellandum profecti confluentis Padi et Ardae fluminum , sedecim inde milium spatio distantis , petebant$$ They started for a campaign rather than for a battle ,  making for the confluence of the Padus and Addua ,  a distance of sixteen miles from their position
 Celso et Paulino abnuentibus militem itinere fessum , sarcinis gravem obicere hosti , non omissuro quo minus expeditus et vix quattuor milia passuum progressus aut incompositos in agmine aut dispersos et vallum molientis adgrederetur , Titianus et Proculus , ubi consiliis vincerentur , ad ius imperii transibant$$ Celsus and Paullinus remonstrated against exposing troops wearied with a march and encumbered with baggage to any enemy ,  who ,  being himself ready for action and having marched barely four miles ,  would not fail to attack them ,  either when they were in the confusion of an advance ,  or when they were dispersed and busy with the work of entrenchment Titianus and Proculus ,  overcome in argument ,  fell back on the Imperial authority
 aderat sane citus equo Numida cum atrocibus mandatis , quibus Otho increpita ducum segnitia rem in discrimen mitti iubebat , aeger mora et spei impatiens$$ It was true that a Numidian had arrived at full gallop with an angry message from Otho ,  in which the Emperor ,  sick of delay and impatient of suspense ,  sharply rebuked the inactivity of the generals ,  and commanded that matters should be brought to an issue
 Eodem die ad Caecinam operi pontis intentum duo praetoriarum cohortium tribuni , conloquium eius postulantes , venerunt$$ The same day ,  while Caecina was engaged on the construction of a bridge ,  two tribunes of the Praetorian Guard came to him and begged an interview
 audire condiciones ac reddere parabat , cum praecipites exploratores adesse hostem nuntiavere$$ He was on the point of hearing their proposals and sending back his own ,  when the scouts arrived at headlong speed with the news that the enemy were close at hand
 interruptus tribunorum sermo , eoque incertum fuit insidias an proditionem vel aliquod honestum consilium coeptaverint$$ The address of the tribunes was thus abruptly terminated Thus it remained uncertain whether deception ,  or treason ,  or some honourable arrangement ,  had been in their thoughts
 Caecina dimissis tribunis revectus in castra datum iussu Fabii Valentis pugnae signum et militem in armis invenit$$ Caecina dismissed the tribunes and rode back to the camp There he found that Fabius Valens had given the signal for battle ,  and that the troops were under arms
 dum legiones de ordine agminis sortiuntur , equites prorupere et mirum dictu , a paucioribus Othonianis quo minus in vallum inpingerentur , Italicae legionis virtute deterriti sunt$$ While the legions were casting lots for the order of march ,  the cavalry charged ,  and ,  strange to say ,  were kept only by the courage of the Italian legion from being driven back on the entrenchments by an inferior force of Othonianists
 ea strictis mucronibus redire pulsos et pugnam resumere coegit$$ These men ,  at the sword's point ,  compelled the beaten squadron to wheel round and resume the conflict
 disposita Vitellianarum legionum acies sine trepidatione$$ The line of the Vitellianists was formed without hurry ,  for ,  though the enemy was close at hand ,  the sight of their arms was intercepted by the thick brushwood
 etenim quamquam vicino hoste aspectus armorum densis arbustis prohibebatur$$ In Otho's army the generals were full of fear ,  and the soldiers hated their officers
 apud Othonianos pavidi duces , miles ducibus infensus , mixta vehicula et lixae , et praeruptis utrimque fossis via quieto quoque agmini angusta$$ the baggage-wagons and the camp-followers were mingled with the troops and as there were steep ditches on both sides the road ,  it would have been found too narrow even for an undisturbed advance
 circumsistere alii signa sua , quaerere alii$$ Some were gathering round their standards

 Batavorum cohortes , ne quid truculentius auderent , in Germaniam remissae , principium interno simul externoque bello parantibus fatis$$ The Batavian cohorts were sent back to Germany ,  lest they should venture on further violence Destiny was thus simultaneously preparing the occasions of civil and of foreign war

 et promiscae missiones offerebantur$$ Discharges were offered without distinction
 exitiabile id rei publicae , ingratum militi , cui eadem munia inter paucos periculaque ac labor crebrius redibant$$ This measure was disastrous to the State ,  and distasteful to the soldier ,  who found that the same duty was distributed among a smaller number ,  and that his toils and risks came round in a more frequent succession
 et vires luxu corrumpebantur , contra veterem disciplinam et instituta maiorum apud quos virtute quam pecunia res Romana melius stetit$$ Their vigour too was undermined by luxury ,  a luxury that transgressed our ancient discipline and the customs of our ancestors ,  in whose days the power of Rome found a surer foundation in valour than in wealth
 Inde Vitellius Cremonam flexit et spectato munere Caecinae insistere Bedriacensibus campis ac vestigia recentis victoriae lustrare oculis concupivit , foedum atque atrox spectaculum$$ Vitellius then directed his course to Cremona ,  and after witnessing the spectacle exhibited by Caecina ,  he conceived a desire to visit the plains of Bedriacum and to survey the scene of the recent victory
 intra quadragensimum pugnae diem lacera corpora , trunci artus , putres virorum equorumque formae , infecta tabo humus , protritis arboribus ac frugibus dira vastitas$$ It was a hideous and terrible sight Not forty days had passed since the battle ,  and there lay mangled corpses ,  severed limbs ,  the putrefying forms of men and horses the soil was saturated with gore ,  and ,  what with levelled trees and crops ,  horrible was the desolation
 nec minus inhumana pars viae quam Cremonenses lauru rosaque constraverant , extructis altaribus caesisque victimis regium in morem quae laeta in praesens mox perniciem ipsis fecere$$ Not less revolting was that portion of the road which the people of Cremona had strewed with laurel leaves and roses ,  and on which they had raised altars ,  and sacrificed victims as if to greet some barbarous despot ,  festivities in which they delighted for the moment ,  but which were afterwards to work their ruin
 aderant Valens et Caecina , monstrabantque pugnae locos$$ Valens and Caecina were present ,  and pointed out the various localities of the field of battle

 iam tribuni praefectique , sua quisque facta extollentes , falsa vera aut maiora vero miscebant$$ how from another the cavalry had charged how from a third the auxiliary troops had turned the flank of the enemy
 vulgus quoque militum clamore et gaudio deflectere via , spatia certaminum recognoscere , aggerem armorum , strues corporum intueri mirari et erant quos varia sors rerum lacrimaeque et misericordia subiret$$ The tribunes and prefects extolled their individual achievements ,  and mixed together fictions ,  facts ,  and exaggerations The common soldiers also turned aside from the line of march with joyful shouts ,  and recognized the various scenes of conflict ,  and gazed with wonder on the piles of weapons and the heaps of slain
 at non Vitellius flexit oculos nec tot milia insepultorum civium exhorruit$$ Some indeed there were whom all this moved to thoughts of the mutability of fortune ,  to pity ,  and to tears

 quantoque magis propinquabat , tanto corruptius iter immixtis histrionibus et spadonum gregibus et cetero Neronianae aulae ingenio$$ The nearer the Emperor approached to Rome ,  the greater was the license of his march ,  accompanied as it was by players and herds of eunuchs ,  in fact by all that had characterised the court of Nero
 namque et Neronem ipsum Vitellius admiratione celebrabat , sectari cantantem solitus , non necessitate , qua honestissimus quisque , sed luxu et saginae mancipatus emptusque$$ Indeed ,  Vitellius used to make a display of his admiration for Nero ,  and had constantly followed him when he sang ,  not from the compulsion to which the noblest had to yield ,  but because he was the slave and chattel of profligacy and gluttony
 ut Valenti et Caecinae vacuos honoris mensis aperiret , coartati aliorum consulatus , dissimulatus Marci Macri tamquam Othonianarum partium ducis$$ To leave some months of office open for Valens and Caecina ,  the consulates of others were abridged ,  that of Martius Macer was ignored on the ground of his having been one of Otho's generals
 et Valerium Marinum destinatum a Galba consulem distulit , nulla offensa , sed mitem et iniuriam segniter laturum$$ Valerius Maximus ,  who had been nominated consul by Galba ,  had his dignity deferred for no offence ,  but because he was a man of gentle temper ,  and could submit tamely to an affront

 igitur deterrimo quoque in argumentum fabulae adsumpto vulgus credulum et quidam militum , errore veri seu turbarum studio , certatim adgregabantur , cum pertractus ad Vitellium interrogatusque quisnam mortalium esset postquam nulla dictis fides et a domino noscebatur condicione fugitivus , nomine Geta , sumptum de eo supplicium in servilem modum$$ He admitted into the secret of his imposture all the most worthless of his followers and the credulous populace and some of the soldiers ,  either from not knowing the truth ,  or impatient for revolution ,  began eagerly to rally round him When he was brought before Vitellius ,  and asked who he was ,  as his account of himself could not be trusted ,  ,  and his master recognised him as a runaway slave ,  by name Geta ,  he was executed as slaves usually are
 At Vespasianus bellum armaque et procul vel iuxta sitas viris circumspectabat$$ Vespasian ,  on the other hand ,  was taking a general survey of the chances of a campaign and of his resources both immediate and remote
 miles ipsi adeo paratus ut praeeuntem sacramentum et fausta Vitellio omnia precantem per silentium audierint$$ The soldiers were so entirely devoted to him ,  that as he dictated the oath of allegiance and prayed for all prosperity to Vitellius ,  they listened to him in silence

 tertiam legionem , quod e Syria in Moesiam transisset , suam numerabat ceterae Illyrici legiones secuturae sperabantur$$ The third legion ,  as it had passed over from Syria to Moesia ,  Vespasian counted upon as devoted to himself ,  and it was hoped that the other legions of Illyricum would follow its example
 namque omnis exercitus flammaverat adrogantia venientium a Vitellio militum , quod truces corpore , horridi sermone ceteros ut imparis inridebant$$ In fact the whole army had been kindled into indignation by the insolence of the soldiers who came among them from Vitellius Savage in appearance ,  and speaking a rude dialect ,  they ridiculed everybody else as their inferiors
 sed in tanta mole belli plerumque cunctatio$$ But in such gigantic preparations for war there is usually delay
 et Vespasianus modo in spem erectus , aliquando adversa reputabat$$ Vespasian was at one moment high in hope ,  and at another disposed to reflect on the chances of failure
 quis ille dies foret quo sexaginta aetatis annos et duos filios iuvenes bello permitteret esse privatis cogitationibus progressum et , prout velint , plus minusve sumi ex fortuna imperium cupientibus nihil medium inter summa aut praecipitia$$ What a day would that be when he should expose himself with his sixty years upon him ,  and the two young men ,  his sons ,  to the perils of war!

 His pavoribus nutantem et alii legati amicique firmabant et Mucianus , post multos secretosque sermones iam et coram ita locutus$$ Though staggered by these apprehensions ,  he was confirmed in his purpose by others among the legates and among his own friends ,  and particularly by Mucianus ,  who ,  after many conversations with him in private ,  now publicly addressed him in the following terms 
 omnes , qui magnarum rerum consilia suscipiunt , aestimare debent an quod inchoatur rei publicae utile , ipsis gloriosum , promptum effectu aut certe non arduum sit$$  All who enter upon schemes involving great interests ,  should consider whether what they are attempting be for the advantage of the State ,  for their own credit ,  easy of accomplishment ,  or at any rate free from serious difficulty

 ego te , Vespasiane , ad imperium voco , quam salutare rei publicae , quam tibi magnificum , iuxta deos in tua manu positum est$$ I invite you ,  Vespasian ,  to a dignity which will be as beneficial to the State ,  as it will be honourable to yourself
 nec speciem adulantis expaveris$$ Under heaven this dignity lies within your reach
 a contumelia quam a laude propius fuerit post Vitellium eligi$$ And do not dread what may present the semblance of flattery
 non adversus divi Augusti acerrimam mentem nec adversus cautissimam Tiberii senectutem , ne contra Gai quidem aut Claudii vel Neronis fundatam longo imperio domum exurgimus$$ To be chosen successor to Vitellius would be more of an insult than a compliment It is not against the vigorous intellect of the Divine Augustus ,  it is not against the profound subtlety of the aged Tiberius ,  it is not even against the house of Caius ,  Claudius ,  or Nero ,  established by a long possession of the Empire ,  that we are rising in revolt
 cessisti etiam Galbae imaginibus$$ You have already yielded to the prestige even of Galba's family
 torpere ultra et polluendam perdendamque rem publicam relinquere sopor et ignavia videretur , etiam si tibi quam inhonesta , tam tuta servitus esset$$ To persist in inaction ,  and to leave the State to degradation and ruin ,  would look like indolence and cowardice ,  even supposing that servitude were as safe for you as it would be infamous

 confugiendum est ad imperium$$ That power is now your only refuge

 ne Othonem quidem ducis arte aut exercitus vi , sed praepropera ipsius desperatione victum , iam desiderabilem et magnum principem fecit , cum interim spargit legiones , exarmat cohortis , nova cotidie bello semina ministrat$$ That an Emperor can be created by the army ,  Vitellius is himself a proof ,  who ,  though he had seen no service and had no military reputation ,  was raised to the throne by the unpopularity of Galba
 si quid ardoris ac ferociae miles habuit , popinis et comissationibus et principis imitatione deteritur tibi e Iudaea et Syria et Aegypto novem legiones integrae , nulla acie exhaustae , non discordia corruptae , sed firmatus usu miles et belli domitor externi$$ Otho ,  who was overcome ,  not indeed by skilful generalship ,  or by a powerful enemy ,  but by his own premature despair ,  this man has made into a great and deservedly regretted Emperor ,  and all the while he is disbanding his legions ,  disarming his auxiliaries ,  and sowing every day fresh seeds of civil war
 classium alarum cohortium robora et fidissimi reges et tua ante omnis experientia$$ All the energy and high spirit which once belonged to his army is wasted in the revelry of taverns and in aping the debaucheries of their chief

 me Vitellio antepono , te mihi$$ I count myself better than Vitellius
 tuae domui triumphale nomen , duo iuvenes , capax iam imperii alter et primis militiae annis apud Germanicos quoque exercitus clarus$$ I count you better than myself Your house is ennobled by the glories of a triumph it has two youthful scions ,  one of whom is already equal to the cares of Empire ,  and in the earliest years of his military career won renown with these very armies of Germany
 absurdum fuerit non cedere imperio ei cuius filium adoptaturus essem , si ipse imperarem$$ It would be ridiculous in me not to waive my claims to Empire in favour of the man whose son I should adopt ,  were I myself Emperor
 ceterum inter nos non idem prosperarum adversarumque rerum ordo erit$$ Between us ,  however ,  there will not be an equal distribution of the fruits of success or failure
 nam si vincimus , honorem quem dederis habebo$$ If we are victorious
 discrimen ac pericula ex aequo patiemur$$ I shall have whatever honour you think fit to bestow on me
 immo , ut melius est , tu tuos exercitus rege , mihi bellum et proeliorum incerta trade$$ the danger and the peril we shall share alike nay ,  I would rather have you ,  as is the better policy ,  direct your armies ,  and leave to me the conduct of the war and the hazards of battle

 hos ira , odium , ultionis cupiditas ad virtutem accendit$$ The conquered are fired to valour by anger ,  by hatred ,  by the desire of vengeance ,  while the conquerors are losing their energy in pride and insolence
 illi per fastidium et contumacia hebescunt$$ War will of itself discover and lay open the hidden and rankling wounds of the victorious party
 aperiet et recludet contecta et tumescentia victricium partium vulnera bellum ipsum$$ And ,  indeed ,  your vigilance ,  economy ,  and wisdom ,  do not inspire me with greater confidence of success than do the indolence ,  ignorance ,  and cruelty of Vitellius
 nec mihi maior in tua vigilantia parsimonia sapientia fiducia est quam in Vitellii torpore inscitia saevitia$$ Once at war ,  we have a better cause than we can have in peace ,  for those who deliberate on revolt have revolted already
 Post Muciani orationem ceteri audentius circumsistere , hortari , responsa vatum et siderum motus referre$$ After this speech from Mucianus ,  the other officers crowded round Vespasian with fresh confidence ,  encouraging him ,  and reminding him of the responses of prophets and the movements of the heavenly bodies
 nec erat intactus tali superstitione , ut qui mox rerum dominus Seleucum quendam mathematicum rectorem et praescium palam habuerit$$ Nor was Vespasian proof against this superstition ,  for afterwards ,  when master of the world ,  he openly retained one Seleucus ,  an astrologer ,  to direct his counsels ,  and to foretell the future
 recursabant animo vetera omina$$ Old omens now recurred to his thoughts
 cupressus arbor in agris eius conspicua altitudine repente prociderat ac postera die eodem vestigio resurgens procera et latior virebat$$ A cypress tree of remarkable height on his estate had suddenly fallen ,  and rising again the following day on the very same spot ,  had flourished with majestic beauty and even broader shade
 grande id prosperumque consensu haruspicum et summa claritudo iuveni admodum Vespasiano promissa , sed primo triumphalia et consulatus et Iudaicae victoriae decus implesse fidem ominis videbatur$$ This ,  as the Haruspices agreed ,  was an omen of brilliant success ,  and the highest distinction seemed prophesied to Vespasian in early youth At first ,  however ,  the honours of a triumph ,  his consulate ,  and the glory of his victories in Judaea ,  appeared to have justified the truth of the omen
 ut haec adeptus est , portendi sibi imperium credebat$$ When he had won these distinctions ,  he began to believe that it portended the Imperial power

 has ambages et statim exceperat fama et tunc aperiebat$$ These obscure intimations popular rumour had at once caught up ,  and now began to interpret
 nec quicquam magis in ore vulgi$$ Nothing was more talked about by the common people
 crebriores apud ipsum sermones , quanto sperantibus plura dicuntur$$ In Vespasian's presence the topic was more frequently discussed ,  because to the aspirant himself men have more to say
 Initium ferendi ad Vespasianum imperii Alexandriae coeptum , festinante Tiberio Alexandro , qui kalendis Iuliis sacramento eius legiones adegit isque primus principatus dies in posterum celebratus , quamvis Iudaicus exercitus quinto nonas Iulias apud ipsum iurasset , eo ardore ut ne Titus quidem filius expectaretur , Syria remeans et consiliorum inter Mucianum ac patrem nuntius$$ With purposes no longer doubtful they parted ,  Mucianus for Antioch ,  Vespasian for Caesarea These cities are the capitals of Syria and Judaea respectively The initiative in transferring the Empire to Vespasian was taken at Alexandria under the prompt direction of Tiberius Alexander ,  who on the 1st of July made the legions swear allegiance to him That day was ever after celebrated as the first of his reign ,  though the army of Judaea on July 3rd took the oath to Vespasian in person with such eager alacrity that they would not wait for the return of his son Titus ,  who was then on his way back from Syria ,  acting as the medium between Mucianus and his father for the communication of their plans
 cuncta impetu militum acta non parata contione , non coniunctis legionibus$$ All this was done by the impulsive action of the soldiers without the preliminary of a formal harangue or any concentration of the legions
 Dum quaeritur tempus locus quodque in re tali difficillimum est , prima vox , dum animo spes timor , ratio casus obversantur , egressum cubiculo Vespasianum pauci milites , solito adsistentes ordine ut legatum salutaturi , imperatorem salutavere$$ While they were seeking a suitable time and place ,  and for that which in such an affair is the great difficulty ,  the first man to speak ,  while hope ,  fear ,  the chances of success or of disaster ,  were present to their minds ,  one day ,  on Vespasian quitting his chamber ,  a few soldiers who stood near ,  in the usual form in which they would salute their legate ,  suddenly saluted him as Emperor
 tum ceteri adcurrere , Caesarem et Augustum et omnia principatus vocabula cumulare$$ Then all the rest hurried up ,  called him Caesar and Augustus ,  and heaped on him all the titles of Imperial rank
 mens a metu ad fortunam transierat$$ Their minds had passed from apprehension to confidence of success
 in ipso nihil tumidum , adrogans aut in rebus novis novum fuit$$ In Vespasian there appeared no sign of elation or arrogance ,  or of any change arising from his changed fortunes
 ut primum tantae altitudinis obfusam oculis caliginem disiecit , militariter locutus laeta omnia et affluentia excepit$$ As soon as he had dispelled the mist with which so astonishing a vicissitude had clouded his vision ,  he addressed the troops in a soldier-like style ,  and listened to the joyful intelligence that came pouring in from all quarters
 namque id ipsum opperiens Mucianus alacrem militem in verba Vespasiani adegit$$ This was the very opportunity for which Mucianus had been waiting
 tum Antiochensium theatrum ingressus , ubi illis consultare mos est , concurrentis et in adulationem effusos adloquitur , satis decorus etiam Graeca facundia , omniumque quae diceret atque ageret arte quadam ostentator$$ He now at once administered to the eager soldiers the oath of allegiance to Vespasian Then he entered the theatre at Antioch ,  where it is customary for the citizens to hold their public deliberations ,  and as they crowded together with profuse expressions of flattery ,  he addressed them
 nihil aeque provinciam exercitumque accendit quam quod adseverabat Mucianus statuisse Vitellium ut Germanicas legiones in Syriam ad militiam opulentam quietamque transferret , contra Syriacis legionibus Germanica hiberna caelo ac laboribus dura mutarentur$$ He could speak Greek with considerable grace ,  and in all that he did and said he had the art of displaying himself to advantage Nothing excited the provincials and the army so much as the assertion of Mucianus that Vitellius had determined to remove the legions of Germany to Syria ,  to an easy and lucrative service ,  while the armies of Syria were to have given them in exchange the encampments of Germany with their inclement climate and their harassing toils
 quippe et provinciales sueto militum contubernio gaudebant , plerique necessitudinibus et propinquitatibus mixti , et militibus vetustate stipendiorum nota et familiaria castra in modum penatium diligebantur$$ On the one hand ,  the provincials from long use felt a pleasure in the companionship of the soldiers ,  with whom many of them were connected by friendship or relationship on the other ,  the soldiers from the long duration of their service loved the well-known and familiar camp as a home
 Prima belli cura agere dilectus , revocare veteranos$$ The first business of the campaign was to levy troops and recall the veterans to service
 destinantur validae civitates exercendis armorum officinis$$ The strong cities were set apart for the manufacture of arms
 apud Antiochensis aurum argentumque signatur , eaque cuncta per idoneos ministros suis quaeque locis festinabantur$$ at Antioch gold and silver money was coined ,  everything being vigorously carried on in its appointed place by properly qualified agents
 ipse Vespasianus adire , hortari , bonos laude , segnis exemplo incitare saepius quam coercere , vitia magis amicorum quam virtutes dissimulans$$ Vespasian himself went everywhere ,  urged to exertion ,  encouraged the industrious by praise ,  and with the indolent used the stimulus of example rather than of compulsion ,  and chose to be blind to the faults rather than to the merits of his friends
 multos praefecturis et procurationibus , plerosque senatorii ordinis honore percoluit , egregios viros et mox summa adeptos$$ Many among them he distinguished with prefectures and governments ,  and several with the honours of senatorial rank
 quibusdam fortuna pro virtutibus fuit$$ all these were men of eminence who soon reached the highest positions
 donativum militi neque Mucianus prima contione nisi modice ostenderat , ne Vespasianus quidem plus civili bello obtulit quam alii in pace , egregie firmus adversus militarem largitionem eoque exercitu meliore$$ In some cases good fortune served instead of merit Of a donative to the troops Mucianus in his first speech had held out only moderate hopes ,  and even Vespasian offered no more in the civil war than others had done in times of peace ,  thus making a noble stand against all bribery of the soldiery ,  and possessing in consequence a better army
 missi ad Parthum Armeniumque legati , provisumque ne versis ad civile bellum legionibus terga nudarentur$$ Envoys were sent to Parthia and Armenia ,  and precautions were taken that ,  when the legions were engaged in the civil war ,  the country in their rear might not be exposed to attack
 Titum instare Iudaeae , Vespasianum obtinere claustra Aegypti placuit$$ It was arranged that Titus should pursue the war in Judaea ,  while Vespasian should secure the passes into Egypt
 sufficere videbantur adversus Vitellium pars copiarum et dux Mucianus et Vespasiani nomen ac nihil arduum fatis$$ To cope with Vitellius ,  a portion of the army ,  the generalship of Mucianus ,  the prestige of Vespasian's name ,  and the destiny before which all difficulties vanish ,  seemed sufficient
 ad omnis exercitus legatosque scriptae epistulae praeceptumque ut praetorianos Vitellio infensos reciperandae militiae praemio invitarent$$ To all the armies and legates letters were despatched ,  and instructions were given to them that they were to attach the Praetorians ,  who hated Vitellius ,  by the inducement of renewed military service
 Mucianus cum expedita manu , socium magis imperii quam ministrum agens , non lento itinere , ne cunctari videretur , neque tamen properans , gliscere famam ipso spatio sinebat , gnarus modicas viris sibi et maiora credi de absentibus$$ Mucianus ,  who acted more as a colleague than as a servant of the Emperor ,  moved on with some light-armed troops ,  not indeed at a tardy pace so as to give the appearance of delay ,  yet not with extraordinary speed Thus he allowed rumour to gather fresh strength by distance ,  well aware that his force was but small ,  and that exaggerated notions are formed about what is not seen
 sed legio sexta et tredecim vexillariorum milia ingenti agmine sequebantur$$ Behind him ,  however ,  came in a vast body the 6th legion and 13 , 000 veterans
 classem e Ponto Byzantium adigi iusserat , ambiguus consilii num omissa Moesia Dyrrachium pedite atque equite , simul longis navibus versum in Italiam mare clauderet , tuta pone tergum Achaia Asiaque , quas inermis exponi Vitellio , ni praesidiis firmarentur atque ipsum Vitellium in incerto fore quam partem Italiae protegeret , si sibi Brundisium Tarentumque et Calabriae Lucaniaeque litora infestis classibus peterentur$$ He had given directions that the fleet from the Pontus should be brought up to Byzantium ,  not having yet made up his mind ,  whether ,  avoiding Moesia ,  he should move on Dyrrachium with his infantry and cavalry ,  and at the same time blockade the sea on the side of Italy with his ships of war ,  thus leaving Asia and Achaia safe in his rear ,  which ,  being bare of troops ,  would be left at the mercy of Vitellius ,  unless they were occupied with proper garrisons And thus too Vitellius himself ,  finding Brundisium ,  Tarentum ,  and the shores of Calabria and Lucania menaced by hostile fleets ,  would be in utter perplexity as to which part of Italy he should protect
 Igitur navium militum armorum paratu strepere provinciae , sed nihil aeque fatigabat quam pecuniarum conquisitio$$ Thus the provinces echoed with the bustle of preparing fleets ,  armies ,  and the implements of war
 eos esse belli civilis nervos dictitans Mucianus non ius aut verum in cognitionibus , sed solam magnitudinem opum spectabat passim delationes , et locupletissimus quisque in praedam correpti$$ Nothing ,  however ,  was so vexatious as the raising of money Mucianus ,  with the perpetual assertion that money was the sinews of war ,  looked in all questions ,  not to right or truth ,  but only to the extent of a man's fortune
 quae gravia atque intoleranda , sed necessitate armorum excusata etiam in pace mansere , ipso Vespasiano inter initia imperii ad obtinendas iniquitates haud perinde obstinante , donec indulgentia fortunae et pravis magistris didicit aususque est propriis quoque opibus Mucianus bellum iuvit , largus privatim , quod avidius de re publica sumeret ceteri conferendarum pecuniarum exemplum secuti , rarissimus quisque eandem in reciperando licentiam habuerunt$$ Informations abounded ,  and all the richest men were fastened on for plunder These intolerable oppressions ,  which yet found some excuse in the necessities of war ,  were continued even in peace Vespasian himself indeed at the beginning of his reign was not so bent on enforcing these iniquitous measures ,  till ,  spoilt by prosperity and evil counsellors ,  he learnt this policy and ventured to use it Mucianus contributed to the war even from his own purse ,  liberal with his private means because he helped himself without scruple from the wealth of the State
 Adcelerata interim Vespasiani coepta Illyrici exercitus studio transgressi in partis$$ Meanwhile the operations of Vespasian were hastened by the zeal of the army of Illyricum ,  which had come over to his side
 tertia legio exemplum ceteris Moesiae legionibus praebuit$$ The third legion set the example to the other legions of Moesia

 ac forte Priscus Helvidius praetor designatus contra studium eius censuerat$$ and it once happened that Priscus Helvidius ,  the praetor elect ,  had spoken against his wishes
 commotus primo Vitellius , non tamen ultra quam tribunos plebis in auxilium spretae potestatis advocavit mox mitigantibus amicis , qui altiorem iracundiam eius verebantur , nihil novi accidisse respondit quod duo senatores in re publica dissentirent$$ Though at the moment provoked ,  he only called on the tribunes of the people to support his insulted authority ,  and then ,  when his friends ,  who feared his resentment was deeper than it appeared ,  sought to appease him ,  he replied that it was nothing strange that two senators in a Commonwealth should disagree 
 solitum se etiam Thraseae contra dicere$$  he had himself been in the habit of opposing Thrasea

 simul ipsum Vitellium , subitis offensis aut intempestivis blanditiis mutabilem , contemnebant metuebantque$$ Vitellius himself ,  who was ever varying between sudden irritation and unseasonable fondness ,  they at once despised and feared
 nec eo segnius invaserant domos hortos opesque imperii , cum flebilis et egens nobilium turba , quos ipsos liberosque patriae Galba reddiderat , nulla principis misericordia iuvarentur$$ Still this had not made them less keen to seize on palaces and gardens and all the wealth of the Empire ,  while a sad and needy throng of nobles ,  whom with their children Galba had restored to their country ,  received no relief from the compassion of the Emperor
 gratum primoribus civitatis etiam plebs adprobavit , quod reversis ab exilio iura libertorum concessisset , quamquam id omni modo servilia ingenia corrumpebant , abditis pecuniis per occultos aut ambitiosos sinus , et quidam in domum Caesaris transgressi atque ipsis dominis potentiores$$ By an edict which gratified the leading men of the State ,  while it approved itself even to the populace ,  Vitellius gave back to the returned exiles their rights over their freedmen ,  although servile ingenuity sought in every way to neutralise the boon ,  concealing money in quarters which either obscurity or rank rendered secure Some freedmen had made their way into the palace of the Emperor ,  and thus became more powerful even than their patrons

 postremo ne salutis quidem cura infamibus Vaticani locis magna pars tetendit , unde crebrae in vulgus mortes$$ At last ,  reckless even of health ,  a large portion of them quartered themselves in the notoriously pestilential neighbourhood of the Vatican
 et adiacente Tiberi Germanorum Gallorumque obnoxia morbis corpora fluminis aviditas et aestus impatientia labefecit$$ hence ensued a great mortality in the ranks The Tiber was close at hand ,  and their extreme eagerness for the water and their impatience of the heat weakened the constitutions of the Germans and Gauls ,  always liable to disease
 insuper confusus pravitate vel ambitu ordo militiae$$ To make matters worse ,  the organisation of the service was deranged by unprincipled intrigue and favour

 sane adventu eius partes convaluerant , et sinistrum lenti itineris rumorem prospero proelio verterat$$ Doubtless his arrival had restored the fortunes of the party ,  and his victory had reversed the unfavourable rumours occasioned by his tardy advance

 sed neque Aponius cuncta , ut trepidans re subita , perscripserat , et amici adulantes mollius interpretabantur$$ Aponius ,  however ,  agitated by the unexpected occurrence ,  had not written all the particulars ,  and flattering friends softened down its import
 unius legionis eam seditionem , ceteris exercitibus constare fidem$$ It was ,  they said ,  a mutiny of only a single legion
 in hunc modum etiam Vitellius apud milites disseruit , praetorianos nuper exauctoratos insectatus , a quibus falsos rumores dispergi , nec ullum civilis belli metum adseverabat , suppresso Vespasiani nomine et vagis per urbem militibus qui sermones populi coercerent$$ the loyalty of the other armies was unshaken Vitellius in addressing the soldiers spoke to the same effect He inveighed against the lately disbanded Praetorians ,  and asserted that false rumours were circulated by them ,  and that there was no fear of a civil war The name of Vespasian he suppressed ,  and soldiers were dispersed through the city to check the popular gossip
 id praecipuum alimentum famae erat$$ This more than anything else kept these rumours alive
 Auxilia tamen e Germania Britanniaque et Hispaniis excivit , segniter et necessitatem dissimulans$$ Nevertheless Vitellius summoned auxiliary troops from Germany ,  Britain ,  and Spain ,  tardily ,  however ,  and with an attempt to conceal his necessities
 perinde legati provinciaeque cunctabantur , Hordeonius Flaccus suspectis iam Batavis anxius proprio bello , Vettius Bolanus numquam satis quieta Britannia , et uterque ambigui$$ The legates and the provinces were equally slow Hordeonius Flaccus ,  who was beginning to suspect the Batavians ,  feared that he should have a war on his own hands ,  and Vettius Bolanus had in Britain a province never very quiet
 neque ex Hispaniis properabatur , nullo tum ibi consulari$$ and both these officers were wavering in their allegiance
 trium legionum legati , pares iure et prosperis Vitellii rebus certaturi ad obsequium , adversam eius fortunam ex aequo detrectabant in Africa legio cohortesque delectae a Clodio Macro , mox a Galba dimissae , rursus iussu Vitellii militiam cepere simul cetera iuventus dabat impigre nomina quippe integrum illic ac favorabilem proconsulatum Vitellius , famosum invisumque Vespasianus egerat$$ Spain too ,  which then was without a governor of consular rank ,  showed no alacrity The legates of the three legions ,  equal in authority ,  and ready ,  while Vitellius was prosperous ,  to vie in obedience ,  stood aloof with one consent from his falling fortunes In Africa ,  the legion ,  and the auxiliary infantry levied by Clodius Macer and soon after disbanded by Galba ,  again entered the service at the order of Vitellius ,  while all the rest of the youth promptly gave in their names Vitellius had ruled that province as proconsul with integrity and popularity
 proinde socii de imperio utriusque coniectabant , sed experimentum contra fuit$$ Vespasian's government had been infamous and odious The allies formed conjectures accordingly as to the manner in which each would reign ,  but the result contradicted them

 mox nutabat , palam epistulis edictisque Vitellium , occultis nuntiis Vespasianum fovens et haec illave defensurus , prout invaluissent$$ Soon he began to waver ,  supporting Vitellius in his public dispatches and edicts ,  Vespasian in his secret correspondence ,  and intending to hold by the one or the other according as they might succeed

 accedebat huc Caecinae ambitio vetus , torpor recens , nimia fortunae indulgentia soluti in luxum , seu perfidiam meditanti infringere exercitus virtutem inter artis erat$$ All this was aggravated by the old vanity of Caecina ,  and by the indolence that had of late crept over him presuming on the excessive favour of fortune ,  he had abandoned himself to luxury Perhaps he meditated perfidy ,  and it was part of his policy to enervate the courage of the army
 credidere plerique Flavii Sabini consiliis concussam Caecinae mentem , ministro sermonum Rubrio Gallo$$ Many believe that his fidelity had been shaken by the suggestions of Flavius Sabinus ,  who employed Rubrius Gallus as the bearer of communications intimating that the conditions of desertion would be held binding by Vespasian

 quibus opperiri auxilia et trahere bellum videbatur , Germanicarum legionum vim famamque extollebant , et advenisse mox cum Vitellio Britannici exercitus robora$$ Those who thought it advisable to wait for reinforcements ,  and to protract the campaign ,  dwelt on the strength and reputation of the German legions Vitellius ,  they said ,  has now joined them with the flower of the British army
 ipsis nec numerum parem pulsarum nuper legionum , et quamquam atrociter loquerentur , minorem esse apud victos animum$$ Our numbers are not even equal to those of the legions whom they lately defeated and the conquered ,  let them talk as fiercely as they will ,  lose something of their courage
 sed insessis interim Alpibus venturum cum copiis Orientis Mucianum$$ But ,  if we occupy meanwhile the passes of the Alps ,  Mucianus will come up with the forces of the East
 superesse Vespasiano mare , classis , studia provinciarum , per quas velut alterius belli molem cieret$$ Vespasian has in addition the command of the sea ,  his fleets ,  and provinces loyal to his cause ,  in which he may collect the vast materials for what may be called another war
 ita salubri mora novas viris adfore , ex praesentibus nihil periturum$$ A salutary delay will bring us new forces ,  while we shall lose nothing of what we have
 Ad ea Antonius Primus (is acerrimus belli concitator) festinationem ipsis utilem , Vitellio exitiosam disseruit$$ In answer to this ,  Antonius Primus ,  who was the most energetic promoter of the war ,  declared that prompt action would be advantageous to themselves ,  and fatal to Vitellius
 plus socordiae quam fiduciae accessisse victoribus$$ Supineness ,  he said ,  rather than confidence has grown upon the conquerors
 neque enim in procinctu et castris habitos$$ They are not even kept under arms or within camps
 per omnia Italiae municipia desides , tantum hospitibus metuendos , quanto ferocius ante se egerint , tanto cupidius insolitas voluptates hausisse$$ In every town of Italy ,  sunk in sloth ,  formidable only to their entertainers ,  they have drunk of unaccustomed pleasures with an eagerness equal to the rudeness of their former life
 circo quoque ac theatris et amoenitate urbis emollitos aut valetudinibus fessos$$ They have been emasculated by the circus ,  the theatre ,  and the allurements of the capital ,  or they are worn out with sickness
 sed addito spatio rediturum et his robur meditatione belli$$ Yet even to these men ,  if you give them time ,  their old vigour will return with the preparation for war
 nec procul Germaniam , unde vires$$ Germany ,  whence their strength is drawn ,  is faraway
 Britanniam freto dirimi , iuxta Gallias Hispaniasque , utrimque viros equos tributa , ipsamque Italiam et opes urbis$$ Britain is separated only by a strait the provinces of Gaul and Spain are near
 ac si inferre arma ultro velint , duas classis vacuumque Illyricum mare$$ on either side they can find troops ,  horses ,  tribute
 quid tum claustra montium profutura quid tractum in aestatem aliam bellum$$ they have Italy itself ,  and the resources of the capital ,  and ,  should they choose themselves to take the offensive ,  they have two fleets ,  and the Illyrian sea open to them
 unde interim pecuniam et commeatus$$ What good then will our mountain-passes do us
 quin potius eo ipso uterentur quod Pannonicae legiones deceptae magis quam victae resurgere in ultionem properent , Moesici exercitus integras viris attulerint$$ What will be the use of having protracted the war into another summer Where are we to find in the meanwhile money and supplies
 si numerus militum potius quam legionum putetur , plus hinc roboris , nihil libidinum$$ Why not rather avail ourselves of the fact that the legions of Pannonia ,  which were cheated rather than vanquished ,  are hastening to rise again for vengeance ,  and that the armies of Moesia have brought us their unimpaired strength
 et profuisse disciplinae ipsum pudorem$$ If you reckon the number of soldiers ,  rather than that of legions ,  we have greater strength ,  and no vices ,  for our very humiliation has been most helpful to our discipline
 equites vero ne tum quidem victos , sed quamquam rebus adversis disiectam Vitellii aciem$$ As for the cavalry ,  they were not vanquished even on that day
 duae tunc Pannonicae ac Moesicae alae perrupere hostem$$ though the fortune of war was against them ,  they penetrated the Vitellianist lines
 nunc sedecim alarum coniuncta signa pulsu sonituque et nube ipsa operient ac superfundent oblitos proeliorum equites equosque$$ Two squadrons of Moesian and Pannonian cavalry then broke through the enemy
 nisi quis retinet , idem suasor auctorque consilii ero$$ now the united standards of sixteen squadrons will bury and overwhelm with the crash and din and storm of their onset these horses and horsemen that have forgotten how to fight
 vos , quibus fortuna in integro est , legiones continete$$ Unless any one hinders me ,  I who suggest will execute the plan
 mihi expeditae cohortes sufficient$$ You ,  whose fortune never suffered a reverse ,  may keep back the legions
 iam reseratam Italiam , impulsas Vitellii res audietis$$ the light cohorts will be enough for me
 iuvabit sequi et vestigiis vincentis insistere$$ Before long you will hear that Italy has been opened ,  and the power of Vitellius shaken
 Proxima Cornelii Fusci procuratoris auctoritas$$ Next to Primus in influence was Cornelius Fuscus ,  the procurator
 is quoque inclementer in Vitellium invehi solitus nihil spei sibi inter adversa reliquerat$$ He also had been accustomed to inveigh mercilessly against Vitellius ,  and had thus left himself no hope in the event of defeat
 Tampius Flavianus , natura ac senecta cunctator , suspiciones militum inritabat , tamquam adfinitatis cum Vitellio meminisset$$ T Ampius Flavianus ,  disposed to caution by natural temperament and advanced years ,  excited in the soldiers a suspicion that he still remembered his relationship to Vitellius
 idemque , quod coeptante legionum motu profugus , dein sponte remeaverat , perfidiae locum quaesisse credebatur$$ and as he had fled when the movement in the legions began ,  and had then voluntarily returned ,  it was believed that he had sought an opportunity for treachery
 nam Flavianum , omissa Pannonia ingressum Italiam et discrimini exemptum , rerum novarum cupido legati nomen resumere et misceri civilibus armis impulerat , suadente Cornelio Fusco , non quia industria Flaviani egebat , sed ut consulare nomen surgentibus cum maxime partibus honesta specie praetenderetur$$ Flavianus indeed had left Pannonia ,  and had entered Italy ,  and was out of the way of danger ,  when his desire for revolution urged him to resume the title of Legate ,  and to take part in the civil strife Cornelius Fuscus had advised him to this course ,  not that he needed the talents of Flavianus ,  but wishing that a consular name might clothe with its high prestige the very first movements of the party
 Ceterum ut transmittere in Italiam impune et usui foret , scriptum Aponio Saturnino , cum exercitu Moesico celeraret$$ Still ,  that the passage into Italy might be safe and advantageous ,  directions were sent to Aponius Saturninus to hasten up with the armies of Moesia That the provinces might not be exposed without defence to the barbarian tribes ,  the princes of the Sarmatae Iazyges ,  who had in their hands the government of that nation ,  were enrolled in the army
 ac ne inermes provinciae barbaris nationibus exponerentur , principes Sarmatarum Iazugum , penes quos civitatis regimen , in commilitium adsciti$$ These chiefs also offered the service of their people ,  and its force of cavalry ,  their only effective troops but the offer was declined ,  lest in the midst of civil strife they should attempt some hostile enterprise ,  or ,  influenced by higher offers from other quarters ,  should cast off all sense of right and duty
 plebem quoque et vim equitum , qua sola valent , offerebant$$ Sido and Italicus ,  kings of the Suevi ,  were brought over to the cause Their loyalty to the Roman people was of long standing ,  and their nation was more faithful than the other to any trust reposed in them
 remissum id munus , ne inter discordias externa molirentur aut maiore ex diverso mercede ius fasque exuerent trahuntur in partis Sido atque Italicus reges Sueborum , quis vetus obsequium erga Romanos et gens fidei$$ On the flank of the army were posted some auxiliaries ,  for Rhaetia was hostile ,  Portius Septimius ,  the procurator ,  remaining incorruptibly faithful to Vitellius Accordingly ,  Sextilius Felix with Aurius' Horse ,  eight cohorts ,  and the native levies of Noricum ,  was sent to occupy the bank of the river Aenus ,  which flows between Rhaetia and Noricum Neither hazarded an engagement ,  and the fate of the two parties was decided elsewhere
 Antonio vexillarios e cohortibus et partem equitum ad invadendam Italiam rapienti comes fuit Arrius Varus , strenuus bello , quam gloriam et dux Corbulo et prosperae in Armenia res addiderant$$ Antonius ,  as he hurried with the veteran soldiers of the cohorts and part of the cavalry to invade Italy ,  was accompanied by Arrius Varus ,  an energetic soldier Service under Corbulo ,  and successes in Armenia ,  had gained for him this reputation
 idem secretis apud Neronem sermonibus ferebatur Corbulonis virtutes criminatus$$ yet it was generally said ,  that in secret conversations with Nero he had calumniated Corbulo's high qualities
 unde infami gratia primum pilum adepto laeta ad praesens male parta mox in perniciem vertere$$ The favour thus infamously acquired made him a centurion of the first rank ,  yet the ill-gotten prosperity of the moment afterwards turned to his destruction
 sed Primus ac Varus occupata Aquileia <per> proxima quaeque et Opitergii et Altini laetis animis accipiuntur$$ Primus and Varus ,  having occupied Aquileia ,  were joyfully welcomed in the neighbourhood ,  and in the towns of Opitergium and Altinum
 relictum Altini praesidium adversus classis Ravennatis <conatus> , nondum defectione eius audita$$ At Altinum a force was left to oppose the Ravenna fleet ,  the defection of which from Vitellius was not yet known
 inde Patavium et Ateste partibus adiunxere$$ They next attached to their party Patavium and Ateste
 illic cognitum tris Vitellianas cohortis et alam , cui Sebosianae nomen , ad Forum Alieni ponte iuncto consedisse$$ There they learnt that three cohorts ,  belonging to Vitellius ,  and the Sebonian Horse had taken up a position at the Forum Alieni ,  where they had thrown a bridge across the river
 placuit occasio invadendi incuriosos$$ It was determined to seize the opportunity of attacking this force ,  unprepared as it was
 nam id quoque nuntiabatur$$ for this fact had likewise been communicated
 luce prima inermos plerosque oppressere$$ Coming upon them at dawn ,  they killed many before they could arm
 praedictum ut paucis interfectis ceteros pavore ad mutandam fidem cogerent$$ Orders had been given to slay but few ,  and to constrain the rest by fear to transfer their allegiance
 et fuere qui se statim dederent plures abrupto ponte instanti hosti viam abstulerunt$$ Some indeed at once surrendered ,  but the greater part broke down the bridge ,  and thus cut off the advance of the pursuing enemy
 Vulgata victoria legiones septima Galbiana , tertia decima Gemina cum Vedio Aquila legato Patavium alacres veniunt ibi pauci dies ad requiem sumpti , et Minicius Iustus praefectus castrorum legionis septimae , quia adductius quam civili bello imperitabat , subtractus militum irae ad Vespasianum missus est$$ When this success became known ,  two legions ,  the seventh (Galba's) and the eighteenth (the Gemina) ,  finding the campaign opening in favour of the Flavianists ,  repaired with alacrity to Patavium under the command of Vedius Aquila the legate A few days were there taken for rest ,  and Minucius Justus ,  prefect of the camp in the 7th legion ,  who ruled with more strictness than a civil war will permit ,  was withdrawn from the exasperated soldiery ,  and sent to Vespasian
 desiderata diu res interpretatione gloriaque in maius accipitur , postquam Galbae imagines discordia temporum subversas in omnibus municipiis recoli iussit Antonius , decorum pro causa ratus , si placere Galbae principatus et partes revirescere crederentur$$ An act that had been long desired was taken by a flattering construction for more than it was worth ,  when Antonius gave orders that the statues of Galba ,  which had been thrown down during the troubles of the times ,  should be restored in all the towns It would ,  he supposed ,  reflect honour on the cause ,  if it were thought that they had been friendly to Galba's rule ,  and that his party was again rising into strength
 Quaesitum inde quae sedes bello legeretur$$ The next question was ,  what place should be selected as the seat of war
 Verona potior visa , patentibus circum campis ad pugnam equestrem , qua praevalebant$$ Verona seemed the most eligible ,  surrounded as it was with open plains ,  suitable for the action of cavalry ,  in which they were very strong
 simul coloniam copiis validam auferre Vitellio in rem famamque videbatur$$ At the same time it was thought that in wresting from Vitellius a colony so rich in resources there would be both profit and glory
 possessa ipso transitu Vicetia$$ They secured Vicetia by simply passing through it
 quod per se parvum (etenim modicae municipio vires) magni momenti locum obtinuit reputantibus illic Caecinam genitum et patriam hostium duci ereptam$$ Though in itself a small gain ,  for the town is but of moderate strength ,  it was considered an important advantage when they reflected that in this town Caecina was born ,  and that the general of the enemy had lost his native place
 in Veronensibus pretium fuit$$ The people of Verona were a valuable aid
 exemplo opibusque partis iuvere et interiectus exercitus Raetiam Iuliasque Alpis , ac ne pervium illa Germanicis exercitibus foret , obsaepserat$$ they served the cause by the example of their zeal and by their wealth ,  and the army thus occupied a position between Rhaetia and the Julian Alps
 quae ignara Vespasiano aut vetita$$ It was to cut off all passage at this point from the armies of Germany that they had barred this route
 quippe Aquileiae sisti bellum expectarique Mucianum iubebat , adiciebatque imperio consilium , quando Aegyptus , claustra annonae , vectigalia opulentissimarum provinciarum obtinerentur , posse Vitellii exercitum egestate stipendii frumentique ad deditionem subigi$$ All this was done either without the knowledge ,  or against the commands of Vespasian He gave orders that the army should halt at Aquileia and there await Mucianus and these orders he supported by the argument ,  that as Aegypt ,  which commanded the corn supplies ,  and the revenues of the wealthiest provinces were in his hands ,  the army of Vitellius would be compelled to capitulate from the want of pay and provisions
 eadem Mucianus crebris epistulis monebat , incruentam et sine luctu victoriam et alia huiusce modi praetexendo , sed gloriae avidus atque omne belli decus sibi retinens$$ Mucianus in frequent letters advised the same policy a victory that should cost neither blood nor tears ,  and other objects of the kind ,  were his pretexts but in truth he was greedy of glory ,  and anxious to keep the whole credit of the war to himself
 ceterum ex distantibus terrarum spatiis consilia post res adferebantur$$ Owing ,  however ,  to the vast distances ,  the advice came only after the matter was decided
 Adventu deinde duarum legionum , e quibus tertiam Dillius Aponianus , octavam Numisius Lupus ducebant , ostentare viris et militari vallo Veronam circumdare placuit$$ On the subsequent arrival of two legions ,  the third commanded by Dillius Aponianus ,  the eighth by Numisius Lupus ,  it was resolved to make a demonstration of their strength ,  and to surround Verona with military lines
 forte Galbianae legioni in adversa fronte valli opus cesserat , et visi procul sociorum equites vanam formidinem ut hostes fecere$$ It so happened that Galba's legion had had their work allotted to them on that side the lines which faced the enemy ,  and that some of the allied cavalry appearing in the distance were taken for the enemy ,  and excited a groundless panic
 rapiuntur arma metu proditionis$$ They flew to arms ,  and as the rage of the soldiers at the supposed treachery fell upon T
 ira militum in Tampium Flavianum incubuit , nullo criminis argumento , sed iam pridem invisus turbine quodam ad exitium poscebatur$$ Ampius Flavianus ,  not from any proof of his guilt ,  but because he had been long unpopular ,  they clamoured for his death in a very whirlwind of passion ,  vociferating that he was the kinsman of Vitellius ,  that he had betrayed Otho ,  that he had embezzled the donative
 propinquum Vitellii , proditorem Othonis , interceptorem donativi clamitabant$$ He could get no opportunity of defending himself ,  even though he stretched out his hands in entreaty ,  repeatedly prostrating himself on the ground ,  his garments torn ,  his breast and features convulsed with sobs
 nec defensioni locus , quamquam supplicis manus tenderet , humi plerumque stratus , lacera veste , pectus atque ora singultu quatiens$$ This very conduct provoked afresh these furious men ,  for fear so excessive seemed to argue a consciousness of guilt
 id ipsum apud infensos incitamentum erat , tamquam nimius pavor conscientiam argueret$$ Aponius was clamoured down by the shouts of the soldiers ,  when he attempted to address them
 obturbabatur militum vocibus Aponius , cum loqui coeptaret$$ every one else was repulsed with noisy cries
 fremitu et clamore ceteros aspernantur$$ To Antonius alone the soldiers' ears were open
 uni Antonio apertae militum aures$$ for he had eloquence ,  the art of soothing an angry crowd ,  and personal influence
 namque et facundia aderat mulcendique vulgum artes et auctoritas$$ As the mutiny grew fiercer ,  and the soldiers went on from abuse and taunts to use their hands and their weapons ,  he ordered that Flavianus should be put in irons
 ubi crudescere seditio et a conviciis ac probris ad tela et manus transibant , inici catenas Flaviano iubet$$ The soldiers saw what a mockery it was ,  and pushing aside those who were guarding the tribunal ,  were about to commit the most outrageous violence
 sensit ludibrium miles , disiectisque qui tribunal tuebantur extrema vis parabatur$$ Antonius threw himself in the way with his sword drawn ,  protesting that he would die either by the soldiers' hands or by his own
 opposuit sinum Antonius stricto ferro , aut militum se manibus aut suis moriturum obtestans , ut quemque notum et aliquo militari decore insignem aspexerat , ad ferendam opem nomine ciens$$ whenever he saw any one who was known to him ,  or who was distinguished by any military decoration ,  he summoned him by name to his assistance Then he turned to the standards ,  and prayed to the gods of war ,  that they would inspire the armies of the enemy ,  rather than his own ,  with such madness and such strife
 mox conversus ad signa et bellorum deos , hostium potius exercitibus illum furorem , illam discordiam inicerent orabat , donec fatisceret seditio et extremo iam die sua quisque in tentoria dilaberentur$$ So the mutiny began to abate ,  and at the close of the day the men dispersed to their tents The same night Flavianus set out ,  and being met by letters from Vespasian ,  was relieved from his perilous position
 Ne in Vitellii quidem partibus quietae mentes exitiosiore discordia non suspicionibus vulgi , sed perfidia ducum turbabantur$$ Nor indeed was there less restlessness among the partisans of Vitellius ,  who were distracted by yet more fatal dissensions ,  springing ,  not from the suspicions of the common men ,  but from the treachery of the generals
 Lucilius Bassus classis Ravennatis praefectus ambiguos militum animos , quod magna pars Dalmatae Pannoniique erant , quae provinciae Vespasiano tenebantur , partibus eius adgregaverat$$ Lucilius Bassus ,  prefect of the Ravenna fleet ,  finding that the troops wavered in purpose ,  from the fact that many were natives of Dalmatia and Pannonia ,  provinces held for Vespasian ,  had attached them to the Flavianist party
 nox proditioni electa , ut ceteris ignaris soli in principia defectores coirent$$ The night-time was chosen for accomplishing the treason ,  because then ,  unknown to all the rest ,  the ringleaders alone might assemble at head-quarters
 Bassus pudore seu metu , quisnam exitus foret , intra domum opperiebatur$$ Bassus ,  moved by shame ,  or perhaps by fear ,  awaited the issue in his house
 trierarchi magno tumultu Vitellii imagines invadunt$$ The captains of the triremes rushed with a great outcry on the images of Vitellius
 et paucis resistentium obtruncatis ceterum vulgus rerum novarum studio in Vespasianum inclinabat$$ a few ,  who attempted to resist ,  were cut down the great majority ,  with the usual love of change ,  were ready to join Vespasian
 tum progressus Lucilius auctorem se palam praebet$$ Then Bassus came forward and openly sanctioned the movement
 classis Cornelium Fuscum praefectum sibi destinat , qui propere adcucurrit$$ The fleet appointed Cornelius Fuscus to be prefect ,  and he hastened to join them
 Bassus honorata custodia Liburnicis navibus Atriam pervectus a praefecto alae Vibennio Rufino , praesidium illic agitante , vincitur , sed exoluta statim vincula interventu Hormi Caesaris liberti is quoque inter duces habebatur$$ Lucilius was put under honourable arrest ,  and conveyed as far as Adria by the Liburnian ships there he was thrown into prison by Vivennius Rufinus ,  prefect of a squadron of cavalry ,  which was there in garrison His chains ,  however ,  were immediately struck off on the interference of Hormus ,  one of the Emperor's freedmen ,  for he too ranked among the generals
 At Caecina , defectione classis vulgata , primores centurionum et paucos militum , ceteris per militiae munera dispersis , secretum castrorum adfectans in principia vocat$$ On the revolt of the fleet becoming known ,  Caecina called together to head-quarters ,  which he purposely selected as being the most retired part of the camp ,  the chief centurions and some few soldiers ,  while the rest were dispersed on various military duties
 ibi Vespasiani virtutem virisque partium extollit$$ Then he extolled the valour of Vespasian ,  and the strength of his party
 transfugisse classem , in arto commeatum , adversas Gallias Hispaniasque , nihil in urbe fidum$$ he told them that the fleet had changed sides ,  that they were straitened for supplies ,  that Gaul and Spain were against them ,  that in the capital there was nothing on which to rely ,  thus making the worst of everything that concerned Vitellius
 atque omnia de Vitellio in deterius mox incipientibus qui conscii aderant , ceteros re nova attonitos in verba Vespasiani adigit$$ Then ,  the conspirators present setting the example ,  and the rest being paralysed by the strangeness of the proceeding ,  he made them swear allegiance to Vespasian
 simul Vitellii imagines dereptae et missi qui Antonio nuntiarent$$ At the same time the images of Vitellius were torn down ,  and persons were despatched to convey the intelligence to Antonius
 sed ubi totis castris in fama proditio , recurrens in principia miles praescriptum Vespasiani nomen , proiectas Vitellii effigies aspexit , vastum primo silentium , mox cuncta simul erumpunt$$ But when this treason became noised abroad throughout the camp ,  when the soldiers ,  hurrying back to head-quarters ,  saw the name of Vespasian written on the colours ,  and the images of Vitellius thrown upon the ground ,  first there was a gloomy silence ,  then all their rage burst out at once
 huc cecidisse Germanici exercitus gloriam ut sine proelio , sine vulnere vinctas manus et capta traderent arma$$ What ,  they cried ,  has the glory of the army of Germany fallen so low ,  that without a battle ,  even without a wound ,  they should yield up hands ready bound and arms resigned to surrender
 quas enim ex diverso legiones$$ What legions indeed are these against us
 nempe victas$$ Only the conquered
 et abesse unicum Othoniani exercitus robur , primanos quartadecimanosque , quos tamen isdem illis campis fuderint straverintque$$ The first and the twelfth ,  the sole strength of the Othonianist army ,  are not there ,  and even them we routed and crushed on these very plains ,  only that so many thousands of armed men ,  like a herd of slaves for sale ,  might be given as a present to the exile Antonius
 ut tot armatorum milia , velut grex venalium , exuli Antonio donum darentur$$ Thus ,  forsooth ,  the adhesion of one fleet would be worth eight legions
 octo nimirum legiones unius classis accessionem fore$$ So it pleases Bassus and Caecina ,  after robbing the Emperor of palaces ,  gardens ,  and money ,  to rob the soldiers of their Emperor
 id Basso , id Caecinae visum , postquam domos hortos opes principi abstulerint , etiam militem auferre$$ But we ,  who have seen nothing of toil and bloodshed ,  we ,  who must be contemptible even to the Flavianists ,  what shall we answer to those who shall ask us of our victories and our defeats
 Quinta ferme hora diei erat , cum citus eques adventare hostis , praegredi paucos , motum fremitumque late audiri nuntiavit$$ It was almost eleven o'clock ,  when a horseman arrived at full speed with the news ,  that the enemy were approaching ,  that a small body was moving in front ,  but that the stir and noise could be heard far and wide
 dum Antonius quidnam agendum consultat , aviditate navandae operae Arrius Varus cum promptissimis equitum prorupit impulitque Vitellianos modica caede$$ While Antonius was deliberating as to what was to be done ,  Arrius Varus ,  eager to do his best ,  charged with the bravest of the cavalry ,  and drove back the Vitellianists ,  inflicting upon them some slight loss
 nam plurium adcursu versa fortuna , et acerrimus quisque sequentium fugae ultimus erat$$ as more came up ,  the fortune of the day changed ,  and those who had been most eager in the pursuit found themselves last in the flight
 nec sponte Antonii properatum , et fore quae acciderant rebatur$$ This rash act did not originate with Antonius
 hortatus suos ut magno animo capesserent pugnam , diductis in latera turmis vacuum medio relinquit iter quo Varum equitesque eius reciperet$$ he anticipated in fact what actually happened He now urged his soldiers to enter on the battle with a good heart he then drew off the squadrons of his cavalry to the two flanks ,  leaving in the midst an open space in which to receive Varus and his troopers
 iussae armari legiones datum per agros signum ut , qua cuique proximum , omissa praeda proelio occurreret$$ the legions were ordered to arm themselves ,  signals were made over the country that every man should leave plundering ,  and join the battle at the nearest point
 pavidus interim Varus turbae suorum miscetur intulitque formidinem$$ Meanwhile the terror-stricken Varus plunged into the disordered ranks of his friends ,  and brought a panic with him
 pulsi cum sauciis integri suomet ipsi metu et angustiis viarum conflictabantur$$ The fresh troops were driven back along with the wounded fugitives ,  confused by their own alarm and by the difficulties of the road
 Nullum in illa trepidatione Antonius constantis ducis aut fortis militis officium omisit$$ In the midst of this panic Antonius omitted nothing that a self-possessed commander or a most intrepid soldier could do
 occursare paventibus , retinere cedentis , ubi plurimus labor , unde aliqua spes , consilio manu voce insignis hosti , conspicuus suis eo postremo ardoris provectus est ut vexillarium fugientem hasta transverberaret$$ He threw himself before the terrified fugitives ,  he held back those who were giving way ,  and wherever the struggle was hardest ,  wherever there was a gleam of hope ,  there he was with his ready skill ,  his bold hand ,  his encouraging voice ,  easily recognized by the enemy ,  and a conspicuous object to his own men
 mox raptum vexillum in hostem vertit quo pudore haud plures quam centum equites restitere$$ At last he was carried to such a pitch of excitement ,  that he transfixed with a lance a flying standard bearer ,  and then ,  seizing the standard ,  turned it towards the enemy
 iuvit locus , artiore illic via et fracto interfluentis rivi ponte , qui incerto alveo et praecipitibus ripis fugam impediebat ea necessitas seu fortuna lapsas iam partis restituit$$ Touched by the reproach ,  a few troopers ,  not more than a hundred in number ,  made a stand The locality favoured them ,  for the road was at that point particularly narrow ,  while the bridge over the stream which crossed it had been broken down ,  and the stream itself ,  with its varying channel and its precipitous banks ,  checked their flight
 firmati inter se densis ordinibus excipiunt Vitellianos temere effusos , atque illi consternantur$$ It was this necessity ,  or a happy chance ,  that restored the fallen fortunes of the party Forming themselves into strong and close ranks ,  they received the attack of the Vitellianists ,  who were now imprudently scattered
 Antonius instare perculsis , sternere obvios , simul ceteri , ut cuique ingenium , spoliare , capere , arma equosque abripere$$ These were at once overthrown Antonius pursued those that fled ,  and crushed those that encountered him Then came the rest of his troops ,  who ,  as they were severally disposed ,  plundered ,  made prisoners ,  or seized on weapons and horses
 et exciti prospero clamore , qui modo per agros fuga palabantur , victoriae se miscebant$$ Roused by the shouts of triumph ,  those who had lately been scattered in flight over the fields hastened to share in the victory
 Ad quartum a Cremona lapidem fulsere legionum signa Rapacis atque Italicae , laeto inter initia equitum suorum proelio illuc usque provecta sed ubi fortuna contra fuit , non laxare ordines , non recipere turbatos , non obviam ire ultroque adgredi hostem tantum per spatium cursu et pugnando fessum forte victi haud perinde rebus prosperis ducem desideraverant atque in adversis deesse intellegebant$$ At the fourth milestone from Cremona glittered the standards of two legions ,  the Italica and the Rapax ,  which had been advanced as far as that point during the success achieved by the first movement of their cavalry But when fortune changed ,  they would not open their ranks ,  nor receive the fugitives ,  nor advance and themselves attack an enemy now exhausted by so protracted a pursuit and conflict
 nutantem aciem victor equitatus incursat et Vipstanus Messala tribunus cum Moesicis auxiliaribus adsequitur , quos multi e legionariis quamquam raptim ductos aequabant$$ Vanquished by accident ,  these men had never in their success valued their general as much as they now in disaster felt his absence The victorious cavalry charged the wavering line
 ita mixtus pedes equesque rupere legionum agmen et propinqua Cremonensium moenia quanto plus spei ad effugium minorem ad resistendum animum dabant$$ the tribune Vipstanus Messalla followed with the auxiliary troops from Moesia ,  whom ,  though hurriedly brought up ,  long service had made as good soldiers as the legionaries
 nec Antonius ultra institit , memor laboris ac vulnerum , quibus tam anceps proelii fortuna , quamvis prospero fine , equites equosque adflictaverat$$ The horse and foot ,  thus mixed together ,  broke through the line of the legions The near neighbourhood of the fortifications of Cremona ,  while it gave more hope of escape ,  diminished the vigour of their resistance
 Inumbrante vespera universum Flaviani exercitus robur advenit utque cumulos super et recentia caede vestigia incessere , quasi debellatum foret , pergere Cremonam et victos in deditionem accipere aut expugnare deposcunt haec in medio , pulchra dictu$$ Antonius did not press forward ,  for he thought of the fatigue and the wounds with which a battle so hard fought ,  notwithstanding its successful termination ,  must have disabled his cavalry and their horses As the shadows of evening deepened the whole strength of the Flavianist army came up They advanced amid heaps of dead and the traces of recent slaughter ,  and ,  as if the war was over ,  demanded that they should advance to Cremona ,  and receive the capitulation of the vanquished party ,  or take the place by storm
 illa sibi quisque , posse coloniam plano sitam impetu capi$$ This was the motive alleged ,  and it sounded well ,  but what every one said to himself was this 
 idem audaciae per tenebras inrumpentibus et maiorem rapiendi licentiam$$  The colony ,  situated as it is on level ground ,  may be taken by assault
 quod si lucem opperiantur , iam pacem , iam preces , et pro labore ac vulneribus clementiam et gloriam , inania , laturos , sed opes Cremonensium in sinu praefectorum legatorumque fore$$ If we attack under cover of darkness ,  we shall be at least as bold ,  and shall enjoy more licence in plunder If we wait for the light ,  we shall be met with entreaties for peace ,  and in return for our toil and our wounds shall receive only the empty satisfaction of clemency and praise ,  but the wealth of Cremona will go into the purses of the legates and the prefects

 militibus cupidinem pugnandi convenire , duces providendo , consultando , cunctatione saepius quam temeritate prodesse$$ Yet there is a division of duties between the army and its generals Eagerness for battle becomes the soldiers ,  but generals serve the cause by forethought ,  by counsel ,  by delay oftener than by temerity
 ut pro virili portione armis ac manu victoriam iuverit , ratione et consilio , propriis ducis artibus , profuturum$$ As I promoted your victory to the utmost of my power by my sword and by my personal exertions ,  so now I must help you by prudence and by counsel ,  the qualities which belong peculiarly to a general

 ordinem agminis disiecti per iram ac tenebras adseverare non ausim , quamquam alii tradiderint quartam Macedonicam dextrum suorum cornu , quintam et quintam decimam cum vexillis nonae secundaeque et vicensimae Britannicarum legionum mediam aciem , sextadecimanos duoetvicensimanosque et primanos laevum cornu complesse$$ Respecting the disposition of the Vitellianist army ,  disordered as it was by its fury and by the darkness ,  I would not venture to speak positively Some ,  however ,  have related ,  that on the right wing was the 4th legion (the Macedonian) that the 5th and 15th ,  with the veterans of three British legions (the 9th ,  2nd ,  and 20th) ,  formed the centre ,  while the left wing was made up of the 1st ,  the 16th ,  and the 22nd

 non iam sanguis neque vulnera morabantur quin subruerent vallum quaterentque portas , innixi umeris et super iteratam testudinem scandentes prensarent hostium tela brachiaque integri cum sauciis , semineces cum expirantibus volvuntur , varia pereuntium forma et omni imagine mortium$$ All I can say is this ,  that neither in Antonius nor in Hormus would this foulest of crimes have been a degeneracy from the character of their former lives Wounds or bloodshed no longer kept the men back from undermining the rampart and battering the gates Supported on the shoulders of comrades ,  and forming a second testudo ,  they clambered up and seized the weapons and even the hands of the enemy The unhurt and the wounded ,  the half-dead and the dying ,  were mingled together with every incident of slaughter and death in every form

 auxit invidiam editum illic a Caecina gladiatorum spectaculum eademque rursus belli sedes et praebiti in acie Vitellianis cibi , caesae quaedam feminae studio partium ad proelium progressae$$ The ill-feeling had been aggravated by the gladiatorial show exhibited there by Caecina ,  by the circumstance that their city was now for the second time the seat of war ,  and by the fact that they had supplied the Vitellianists with provisions in the field ,  and that some of their women ,  taken by party-zeal into the battle ,  had there been slain

 frustra Vespasianum timeri , quem tot Germanicae legiones , tot provinciae virtute ac fide , tantum denique terrarum ac maris immensis spatiis arceat$$ it is for a brother and for a brother's children that I have come hither with my prayers and tears It is idle to fear Vespasian ,  when there are so many legions of Germany ,  so many provinces with their valour and their loyalty ,  and lastly ,  so vast an extent of sea and land with enormous distances ,  to keep him from us

 venere tres cohortes cum ala Britannica , neque ad fallendum aptus numerus neque ad penetrandum$$ Three cohorts with some British cavalry arrived ,  a force too numerous to elude observation ,  too small to force its way

 Turbata per eosdem dies Germania , et socordia ducum , seditione legionum , externa vi , perfidia sociali prope adflicta Romana res$$ About the same time ,  Germany suffered from the supineness of our generals and the mutinous conduct of our legions the assaults of enemies and the perfidy of allies all but overthrew the power of Rome

 erant inter duces qui necterent moras quippe nimius iam Antonius , et certiora ex Muciano sperabantur$$ Some there were among the generals who were contriving delays ,  for Antonius in fact was now becoming too great a man ,  and their hopes from Mucianus were more definite

 tot milia armatorum , lecta equis virisque , si dux alius foret , inferendo quoque bello satis pollebant$$ So many thousand troops ,  comprising the picked men and horses of the army ,  had they been under the direction of a different general ,  would have been quite equal even to aggressive operations

 Contionanti prodigiosum dictu tantum foedarum volucrum supervolitavit ut nube atra diem obtenderent$$ While he was haranguing his troops (marvellous to relate) such a multitude of ill-omened birds flew over him ,  as to obscure with a dark cloud the light of day

 arcuere eos intimi amicorum Vitellii , ita formatis principis auribus ut aspera quae utilia , nec quidquam nisi iucundum et laesurum acciperet$$ They were all kept at a distance by the intimate friends of Vitellius for the Emperor's ears were so formed ,  that all profitable counsels were offensive to him ,  and that he would hear nothing but what would please and ruin

 ea simulatio officii a metu profecta verterat in favorem$$ This pretence of loyalty ,  dictated at first by fear ,  passed into enthusiasm ,  and many expressed compassion ,  not so much for Vitellius ,  as for the fallen condition of the Imperial power
 ac plerique haud proinde Vitellium quam casum locumque principatus miserabantur$$ Vitellius himself failed not to draw out their sympathies by his pitiable looks ,  his voice ,  and his tears

 at Romae senatus cuncta principibus solita Vespasiano decernit , laetus et spei certus , quippe sumpta per Gallias Hispaniasque civilia arma , motis ad bellum Germaniis , mox Illyrico , postquam Aegyptum Iudaeam Syriamque et omnis provincias exercitusque lustraverant , velut expiato terrarum orbe cepisse finem videbantur$$ At Rome the Senate ,  delighted and full of confident hope ,  decreed to Vespasian all the honours customarily bestowed on the Emperors And indeed the civil war ,  which ,  beginning in Gaul and Spain ,  and afterwards drawing into the struggle first Germany and then Illyricum ,  had traversed Aegypt ,  Judaea ,  and Syria ,  every province ,  and every army ,  this war ,  now that the whole earth was ,  as it were ,  purged from guilt ,  seemed to have reached its close

 multo cum honore verborum Muciano triumphalia de bello civium data , sed in Sarmatas expeditio fingebatur$$ their adulation was open enough In most flattering language they voted a triumph to Mucianus ,  a triumph for a civil war ,  though the expedition against the Sarmatae was the pretext

 hinc invidia , et compositae seditionis auctores perpulere ut dilectum abnuerent$$ This caused indignation ,  and the ringleaders of the concerted rebellion prevailed upon the people to refuse the conscription

 Lupercus legionarios e praesentibus , Vbios e proximis , Trevirorum equites haud longe agentis raptim transmisit , addita Batavorum ala , quae iam pridem corrupta fidem simulabat , ut proditis in ipsa acie Romanis maiore pretio fugeret$$ Lupercus in great haste threw across the Rhine such legionaries as were on the spot ,  some Ubian troops who were close at hand ,  and some cavalry of the Treveri ,  who were stationed at no great distance these were accompanied by some Batavian horse ,  who ,  though they had been long disaffected ,  yet still simulated loyalty in order that by betraying the Romans in the moment of actual conflict they might receive a higher price for their desertion
 Civilis captarum cohortium signis circumdatus , ut suo militi recens gloria ante oculos et hostes memoria cladis terrerentur , matrem suam sororesque , simul omnium coniuges parvosque liberos consistere a tergo iubet , hortamenta victoriae vel pulsis pudorem$$ Civilis ,  surrounding himself with the standards of the captured cohorts ,  to keep their recent honours before the eyes of his own men ,  and to terrify the enemy by the remembrance of defeat ,  now directed his own mother and sisters ,  and the wives and children of all his men ,  to stand in the rear ,  where they might encourage to victory ,  or shame defeat

 intumuere statim superbia ferociaque et pretium itineris donativum , duplex stipendium , augeri equitum numerum , promissa sane a Vitellio , postulabant , non ut adsequerentur , sed causam seditioni$$ At once ,  inflated with pride and haughtiness ,  they demanded ,  by way of remuneration for their march ,  a donative ,  double pay ,  and an increase in the number of cavalry ,  things indeed which Vitellius had promised ,  but which they now asked ,  not with the thought of obtaining them ,  but as a pretext for mutiny
 et Flaccus multa concedendo nihil aliud effecerat quam ut acrius exposcerent quae sciebant negaturum$$ Flaccus ,  by his many concessions ,  had produced no other effect but to make them insist with more energy on what they knew he must refuse

 dein paenitentia et arguentibus ipsis qui suaserant , tamquam secuturus scripsit Herennio Gallo legionis primae legato , qui Bonnam obtinebat , ut arceret transitu Batavos$$ Then ,  repenting of his resolve ,  and finding that the very men who had advised it now disapproved it ,  he seemed bent on pursuing the enemy ,  and wrote to Herennius Gallus ,  legate of the first legion ,  who was then holding Bonna ,  that he was to prevent the Batavians from crossing the Rhine ,  and that he would himself hang on their rear with his army
 se cum exercitu tergis eorum haesurum$$ They might have been crushed ,  if Hordeonius ,  moving from one side ,  and Gallus from the other ,  had enclosed them between their armies
 et opprimi poterant si hinc Hordeonius , inde Gallus , motis utrimque copiis , medios clausissent$$ But Flaccus abandoned his purpose ,  and ,  in other despatches to Gallus ,  recommended him not to threaten the departing foe
 Flaccus omisit inceptum aliisque litteris Gallum monuit ne terreret abeuntis unde suspicio sponte legatorum excitari bellum cunctaque quae acciderant aut metuebantur non inertia militis neque hostium vi , sed fraude ducum evenire$$ Thence arose a suspicion that the war was being kindled with the consent of the legates ,  and that everything which had happened ,  or was apprehended ,  was due ,  not to the cowardice of the troops ,  or to the strength of the enemy ,  but to the treachery of the generals
 Batavi cum castris Bonnensibus propinquarent , praemisere qui Herennio Gallo mandata cohortium exponeret$$ When the Batavians were near the camp at Bonna ,  they sent on before them delegates ,  commissioned to deliver to Herennius Gallus a message from the cohorts

 Civilis adventu veteranarum cohortium iusti iam exercitus ductor , sed consilii ambiguus et vim Romanam reputans , cunctos qui aderant in verba Vespasiani adigit mittitque legatos ad duas legiones , quae priore acie pulsae in Vetera castra concesserant , ut idem sacramentum acciperent$$ Civilis ,  who now on the arrival of these veteran cohorts was at the head of a complete army ,  but who was undecided in his plans ,  and still reflected on the power of Rome ,  made all who were with him swear allegiance to Vespasian ,  and sent envoys to the two legions which after their defeat in the previous engagement had retreated into the Old Camp ,  advising them to accept the same allegiance
 redditur responsum$$ Their reply was 
 neque proditoris neque hostium se consiliis uti$$  We do not follow the advice of traitors or enemies
 esse sibi Vitellium principem , pro quo fidem et arma usque ad supremum spiritum retenturos$$ Vitellius is our Emperor to him we will retain our fealty and devote our swords till our last breath
 proinde perfuga Batavus arbitrium rerum Romanarum ne ageret , sed meritas sceleris poenas expectaret$$ Then let not a Batavian refugee affect to decide the destinies of Rome let him rather await the merited penalty of his guilt
 quae ubi relata Civili , incensus ira universam Batavorum gentem in arma rapit$$ When this reply was delivered to Civilis ,  he was furious with anger ,  and hurried the whole Batavian nation into open war
 iunguntur Bructeri Tencterique et excita nuntiis Germania ad praedam famamque$$ The Bructeri and the Tencteri joined him ,  and messengers summoned all Germany to share in his plunder and his glory

 sed parum provisum ut copiae in castra conveherentur$$ Little care ,  however ,  was taken about the conveyance of supplies into the camp
 rapi permisere$$ These the generals allowed to be plundered
 ita paucis diebus per licentiam absumpta sunt quae adversus necessitates in longum suffecissent$$ and so ,  what might long have sufficed for their necessities ,  was wantonly wasted in a few days
 Civilis medium agmen cum robore Batavorum obtinens utramque Rheni ripam , quo truculentior visu foret , Germanorum catervis complet , adsultante per campos equite$$ Civilis ,  who occupied the centre of the army with the elite of the Batavian troops ,  wishing to add a new terror to his demonstration ,  covered both banks of the Rhine with columns of his German allies ,  while his cavalry galloped about the plains
 simul naves in adversum amnem agebantur$$ At the same time the fleet was moved up the stream

 vis et arma satis placebant$$ Hence no labour was bestowed on the ground or on the defences
 Batavi Transrhenanique , quo discreta virtus manifestius spectaretur , sibi quaeque gens consistunt , eminus lacessentes$$ Our valour and our arms seemed defence enough The Batavians and the Transrhenane tribes took up their position ,  each tribe by itself ,  to distinguish and so the better to display the valour of each
 post ubi pleraque telorum turribus pinnisque moenium inrita haerebant et desuper saxis vulnerabantur , clamore atque impetu invasere vallum , adpositis plerique scalis , alii per testudinem suorum$$ first annoying us by a distant volley then ,  as they found that very many of their missiles fixed themselves harmlessly in the turrets and battlements of the walls ,  and they themselves suffered from the stones showered down on them ,  they fell on the entrenchment with a shout and furious rush ,  many placing their scaling-ladders against the ramparts ,  and others mounting on a testudo formed by their comrades
 scandebantque iam quidam , cum gladiis et armorum incussu praecipitati sudibus et pilis obruuntur , praeferoces initio et rebus secundis nimii$$ Some were in the act of climbing over when they were thrust down by the swords of the enemy ,  and fell overwhelmed by a storm of javelins and stakes
 sed tum praedae cupidine adversa quoque tolerabant$$ Always very daring at first and excessively elated by success ,  they now in their eagerness for plunder bore up against reverse
 machinas etiam , insolitum sibi , ausi$$ They also ventured to use what to them was a novelty ,  engines of war
 nec ulla ipsis sollertia perfugae captivique docebant struere materias in modum pontis , mox subiectis rotis propellere , ut alii superstantes tamquam ex aggere proeliarentur , pars intus occulti muros subruerent$$ they had themselves no skill in handling them ,  but the prisoners and deserters taught them to pile up timber in the shape of a bridge ,  under which they put wheels ,  and so propelled it ,  some standing on the top ,  and fighting as they would from an earth-work ,  others concealing themselves within and undermining the walls
 sed excussa ballistis saxa stravere informe opus et cratis vineasque parantibus adactae tormentis ardentes hastae , ultroque ipsi obpugnatores ignibus petebantur , donec desperata vi verterent consilium ad moras , haud ignari paucorum dierum inesse alimenta et multum imbellis turbae$$ But the stones thrown by the catapults prostrated the ill-constructed fabric ,  and when they set themselves to prepare hurdles and mantlets ,  burning spears were thrown on them by the engines ,  fire being thus actually used against the assailants At last ,  despairing of success by force ,  they changed their plans ,  and resolved to wait ,  for they were well aware that only a few days' provisions were in the camp ,  and that there was a great crowd on non-combatants
 simul ex inopia proditio et fluxa servitiorum fides ac fortuita belli sperabantur$$ and they counted at the same time on the treachery that might follow on scarcity ,  on the wavering fidelity of the slaves ,  and on the chances of war
 Flaccus interim cognito castrorum obsidio et missis per Gallias qui auxilia concirent , lectos e legionibus Dillio Voculae duoetvicensimae legionis legato tradit , ut quam maximis per ripam itineribus celeraret , ipse navibus <invadit> invalidus corpore , invisus militibus$$ Meanwhile Flaccus ,  who had heard of the siege of the camp ,  and had sent into all parts of Gaul to collect auxiliaries ,  put under command of Dillius Vocula ,  legate of the 18th legion ,  some troops picked from the legions with orders to hasten by forced marches along the banks of the Rhine Flaccus himself ,  who was weak in health and disliked by his troops ,  travelled with the fleet
 neque enim ambigue fremebant emissas a Mogontiaco Batavorum cohortis , dissimulatos Civilis conatus , adsciri in societatem Germanos$$ The troops indeed complained in unmistakable language that their general had despatched the Batavian cohorts from Mogontiacum ,  had feigned ignorance of the plans of Civilis ,  and was inviting the German tribes to join the league
 non Primi Antonii neque Muciani ope Vespasianum magis adolevisse$$ This ,  they said ,  has strengthened Vespasian no less than the exertions of Primus Antonius and Mucianus
 aperta odia armaque palam depelli$$ Declared enmity and hostility may be openly repulsed ,  but treachery and fraud work in darkness ,  and so cannot be avoided
 fraudem et dolum obscura eoque inevitabilia$$ Civilis stands in arms against us ,  and arranges the order of his battle
 Civilem stare contra , struere aciem$$ Hordeonius from his chamber or his litter gives such orders as may best serve the enemy
 Hordeonium e cubiculo et lectulo iubere quidquid hosti conducat$$ The swords of thousands of brave men are directed by one old man's sick caprice
 tot armatas fortissimorum virorum manus unius senis valetudine regi quin potius interfecto traditore fortunam virtutemque suam malo omine exolverent his inter se vocibus instinctos flammavere insuper adlatae a Vespasiano litterae , quas Flaccus , quia occultari nequibant , pro contione recitavit , vinctosque qui attulerant ad Vitellium misit$$ How much better by slaying the traitor ,  to set free our valour and our fortune from these evil auspices! The passions already kindled by the language which they thus held among themselves were yet more inflamed by a despatch from Vespasian ,  which Flaccus ,  finding that it could not be concealed ,  read before an assembly of the troops ,  sending the persons who had brought it in chains to Vitellius
 Sic mitigatis animis Bonnam , hiberna primae legionis , ventum$$ With feelings somewhat appeased ,  they arrived at Bonna ,  the winter-camp of the first legion
 infensior illic miles culpam cladis in Hordeonium vertebat$$ The troops there were even more enraged against Hordeonius ,  and laid on him the blame of the late disaster

 eiusdem proditione caesos , nullis supervenientibus auxiliis$$ that it was through his treachery that they had been slaughtered ,  no reinforcements coming up
 ignota haec ceteris exercitibus neque imperatori suo nuntiari , cum adcursu tot provinciarum extingui repens perfidia potuerit$$ that all these events were unknown to the other legions ,  and were not told to their Emperor ,  though the sudden outburst of treason might have been crushed by the prompt action of so many provinces
 Hordeonius exemplaris omnium litterarum , quibus per Gallias Britanniamque et Hispanias auxilia orabat , exercitui recitavit instituitque pessimum facinus , ut epistulae aquiliferis legionum traderentur , a quis ante militi quam ducibus legebantur$$ Hordeonius read to the army copies of all the letters which he had sent about Gaul ,  begging for reinforcements ,  and established as a precedent a most disgraceful practice ,  namely ,  the handing over the despatches to the standard-bearers of the legions ,  through whose means they were read by the soldiers sooner than by the generals
 tum e seditiosis unum vinciri iubet , magis usurpandi iuris , quam quia unius culpa foret$$ He then ordered one of the mutineers to be put in irons ,  more for the sake of asserting his authority than because any one man was in fault
 motusque Bonna exercitus in coloniam Agrippinensem , adfluentibus auxiliis Gallorum , qui primo rem Romanam enixe iuvabant$$ The army was then moved from Bonna to the Colonia Agrippinensis ,  while auxiliaries from Gaul continued to flow in
 mox valescentibus Germanis pleraeque civitates adversum nos arma <sumpsere> spe libertatis et , si exuissent servitium , cupidine imperitandi$$ for at first that nation zealously supported the cause of Rome Soon indeed as the Germans increased in power ,  many of the states took up arms against us ,  moved by the hope of freedom and ,  could they once shake off the yoke ,  even by the lust of empire
 gliscebat iracundia legionum , nec terrorem unius militis vincula indiderant$$ The irritation of the legions still increased ,  nor had the imprisonment of a single soldier struck them with terror
 quin idem ille arguebat ultro conscientiam ducis , tamquam nuntius inter Civilem Flaccumque falso crimine testis veri opprimeretur$$ This fellow indeed actually charged the general with complicity he had ,  he said ,  acted as a messenger between Civilis and Flaccus ,  and because he might tell the truth he was now being crushed under a false charge
 conscendit tribunal Vocula mira constantia , prensumque militem ac vociferantem duci ad supplicium iussit$$ With wonderful firmness Vocula ascended the tribunal ,  and ordered the man ,  who had been seized by the lictors ,  and was loudly remonstrating ,  to be led off to execution

 inopia stipendii frumentique et simul dilectum tributaque Galliae aspernantes , Rhenus incognita illi caelo siccitate vix navium patiens , arti commeatus , dispositae per omnem ripam stationes quae Germanos vado arcerent , eademque de causa minus frugum et plures qui consumerent$$ Pay and provisions were scanty ,  Gaul was rebelling against conscription and taxes ,  while the Rhine ,  owing to a drought unexampled in that climate ,  would hardly admit of navigation ,  and thus supplies were straitened at the same time that outposts had to be established along the entire bank to keep the Germans from fording the stream the self-same cause thus bringing about a smaller supply of grain and a greater number of consumers
 apud imperitos prodigii loco accipiebatur ipsa aquarum penuria , tamquam nos amnes quoque et vetera imperii munimenta desererent$$ Among ignorant persons the very failure of the stream was regarded as a prodigy ,  as if the very rivers ,  the old defences of the Empire ,  were deserting us

 ibi struenda acie , muniendo vallandoque et ceteris belli meditamentis militem firmabant$$ Here the generals sought to give steadiness to the troops by such exercises as forming in order of battle ,  constructing fortifications ,  making entrenchments ,  and whatever else might train them for war
 utque praeda ad virtutem accenderetur , in proximos Cugernorum pagos , qui societatem Civilis acceperant , ductus a Vocula exercitus$$ In the hope that they might be fired to courage by the delights of plunder ,  Vocula led the army against the nearest villages of the Gugerni ,  who had accepted the alliance of Civilis
 pars cum Herennio Gallo permansit$$ Some of the troops remained permanently with Herennius Gallus
 Forte navem haud procul castris , frumento gravem , cum per vada haesisset , Germani in suam ripam trahebant$$ One day it happened that at no great distance from the camp the Germans were endeavouring to drag off to their own bank a vessel laden with corn ,  which had run aground in the shallows

 haud dubie gregarius miles Vitellio fidus , splendidissimus quisque in Vespasianum proni$$ The common soldiers were undoubtedly loyal to Vitellius ,  but all the most distinguished men were in favour of Vespasian
 inde scelerum ac suppliciorum vices et mixtus obsequio furor , ut contineri non possent qui puniri poterant$$ The result was an alternation of outbreaks and executions ,  and a strange mixture of obedience and frenzy ,  which made it impossible to restrain the men whom it was yet possible to punish
 At Civilem immensis auctibus universa Germania extollebat , societate nobilissimis obsidum firmata$$ Meanwhile all Germany was raising the power of Civilis by vast additions of strength ,  and the alliance was secured by hostages of the noblest rank
 ille , ut cuique proximum , vastari Vbios Trevirosque , et aliam manum Mosam amnem transire iubet , ut Menapios et Morinos et extrema Galliarum quateret$$ He directed that the territories of the Ubii and the Treveri should be ravaged by the several tribes on which they bordered ,  and that another detachment should cross the river Mosa ,  to threaten the Menapii and the Morini and the frontiers of Gaul
 actae utrobique praedae , infestius in Vbiis , quod gens Germanicae originis eiurata patria Romanorum nomen Agrippinenses vocarentur$$ In both quarters plunder was collected with peculiar hostility in the case of the Ubii ,  because ,  this nation ,  being of German origin ,  had forsworn its native country ,  and assumed the Roman name of the Agrippinenses

 machinas molemque operum Batavis delegat Transrhenanos proelium poscentis ad scindendum vallum ire detrusosque redintegrare certamen iubet , superante multitudine et facili damno$$ He entrusted to the Batavians the care of the machines and the vast siege-works ,  and when the Transrhenane tribes clamoured for battle ,  he bade them go and cut through the ramparts ,  and ,  if repulsed ,  renew the struggle
 Nec finem labori nox attulit congestis circum lignis accensisque , simul epulantes , ut quisque vino incaluerat , ad pugnam temeritate inani ferebantur$$ Piling up logs of wood round the walls and lighting them ,  they sat feasting ,  and rushed to the conflict ,  as each grew heated with wine ,  with a useless daring
 quippe ipsorum tela per tenebras vana Romani conspicuam barbarorum aciem , et si quis audacia aut insignibus effulgens , ad ictum destinabant$$ Their missiles were discharged without effect in the darkness ,  but to the Romans the ranks of the barbarians were plainly discernible ,  and they singled out with deliberate aim anyone whose boldness or whose decorations made him conspicuous

 simul a legionariis peritia et arte praestantibus plura struebantur$$ All this time many engines were constructed by the legionaries ,  who were superior to the enemy in experience and skill
 praecipuum pavorem intulit suspensum et nutans machinamentum , quo repente demisso praeter suorum ora singuli pluresve hostium sublime rapti verso pondere intra castra effundebantur$$ Peculiar consternation was caused by a machine ,  which ,  being poised in the air over the heads of the enemy ,  suddenly descended ,  and carried up one or more of them past the faces of their friends ,  and then ,  by a shifting of the weights ,  projected them within the limits of the camp
 Civilis omissa expugnandi spe rursus per otium adsidebat , nuntiis et promissis fidem legionum convellens$$ Civilis ,  giving up all hope of a successful assault ,  again sat down to blockade the camp at his leisure ,  and undermined the fidelity of the legions by the promises of his emissaries

 vetus miles cunctabatur$$ The veteran soldiers hesitated
 sed adigente Hordeonio Flacco , instantibus tribunis , dixit sacramentum , non vultu neque animo satis adfirmans et cum cetera iuris iurandi verba conciperent , Vespasiani nomen haesitantes aut levi murmure et plerumque silentio transmittebant$$ Nevertheless ,  when Hordeonius administered the oath ,  under a strong pressure from their tribunes ,  they pronounced the words ,  which their looks and their temper belied ,  and while they adopted every other expression ,  they hesitated at the name of Vespasian ,  passing it over with a slight murmur ,  and not unfrequently in absolute silence
 Lectae deinde pro contione epistulae Antonii ad Civilem suspiciones militum inritavere , tamquam ad socium partium scriptae et de Germanico exercitu hostiliter$$ After this ,  certain letters from Antonius to Civilis were read in full assembly ,  and provoked the suspicions of the soldiery ,  as they seemed to be addressed to a partisan of the cause and to be unfriendly to the army of Germany
 mox adlatis Geldubam in castra nuntiis eadem dicta factaque , et missus cum mandatis Montanus ad Civilem ut absisteret bello neve externa armis falsis velaret si Vespasianum iuvare adgressus foret , satis factum coeptis$$ Soon the news reached the camp at Gelduba ,  and the same language and the same acts were repeated Montanus was sent with a message to Civilis ,  bidding him desist from hostilities ,  and not seek to conceal the designs of an enemy by fighting under false colours ,  and telling him that ,  if he had been attempting to assist Vespasian ,  his purpose had been fully accomplished
 ad ea Civilis primo callide post ubi videt Montanum praeferocem ingenio paratumque in res novas , orsus a questu periculisque quae per quinque et viginti annos in castris Romanis exhausisset , egregium inquit pretium laborum recepi , necem fratris et vincula mea et saevissimas huius exercitus voces , quibus ad supplicium petitus iure gentium poenas reposco$$ Civilis at first replied in artful language ,  but soon perceiving that Montanus was a man of singularly high spirit and was himself disposed for change ,  he began with lamenting the perils through which he had struggled for five-and-twenty years in the camps of Rome It is ,  he said ,  a noble reward that I have received for my toils my brother murdered ,  myself imprisoned ,  and the savage clamour of this army ,  a clamour which demanded my execution ,  and for which by the law of nations I demand vengeance
 vos autem Treviri ceteraeque servientium animae , quod praemium effusi totiens sanguinis expectatis nisi ingratam militiam , immortalia tributa , virgas , securis et dominorum ingenia$$ You ,  Treveri ,  and other enslaved creatures ,  what reward do you expect for the blood which you have shed so often What but a hateful service ,  perpetual tribute ,  the rod ,  the axe ,  and the passions of a ruling race
 en ego praefectus unius cohortis et Canninefates Batavique , exigua Galliarum portio , vana illa castrorum spatia excidimus vel saepta ferro fameque premimus$$ See how I ,  the prefect of a single cohort ,  with the Batavians and the Canninefates ,  a mere fraction of Gaul ,  have destroyed their vast but useless camps ,  or are pressing them with the close blockade of famine and the sword
 denique ausos aut libertas sequetur aut victi idem erimus$$ In a word ,  either freedom will follow on our efforts ,  or ,  if we are vanquished ,  we shall but be what we were before
 sic accensum , sed molliora referre iussum dimittit$$ Having thus fired the man's ambition ,  Civilis dismissed him ,  but bade him carry back a milder answer
 ille ut inritus legationis redit , cetera dissimulans , quae mox erupere$$ He returned ,  pretending to have failed in his mission ,  but not revealing the other facts
 Civilis parte copiarum retenta veteranas cohortis et quod e Germanis maxime promptum adversus Voculam exercitumque eius mittit , Iulio Maximo et Claudio Victore , sororis suae filio , ducibus$$ Civilis ,  retaining a part of his forces ,  sent the veteran cohorts and the bravest of his German troops against Vocula and his army ,  under the command of Julius Maximus and Claudius Victor ,  his sister's son
 rapiunt in transitu hiberna alae Asciburgii sita adeoque improvisi castra involavere ut non adloqui , non pandere aciem Vocula potuerit$$ On their march they plundered the winter camp of a body of horse stationed at Ascibergium ,  and they fell on Vocula's camp so unexpectedly that he could neither harangue his army ,  nor even get it into line
 id solum ut in tumultu monuit , subsignano milite media firmare$$ All that he could do in the confusion was to order the veteran troops to strengthen the centre
 auxilia passim circumfusa sunt$$ The auxiliaries were dispersed in every part of the field
 eques prorupit , exceptusque compositis hostium ordinibus terga in suos vertit$$ The cavalry charged ,  but ,  received by the orderly array of the enemy ,  fled to their own lines
 caedes inde , non proelium$$ What ensued was a massacre rather than a battle
 et Nerviorum cohortes , metu seu perfidia , latera nostrorum nudavere$$ The Nervian infantry ,  from panic or from treachery ,  exposed the flank of our army
 sic ad legiones perventum , quae amissis signis intra vallum sternebantur , cum repente novo auxilio fortuna pugnae mutatur$$ Thus the attack fell upon the legions ,  who had lost their standards and were being cut down within the entrenchments ,  when the fortune of the day was suddenly changed by a reinforcement of fresh troops
 Vasconum lectae a Galba cohortes ac tum accitae , dum castris propinquant , audito proeliantium clamore intentos hostis a tergo invadunt latioremque quam pro numero terrorem faciunt , aliis a Novaesio , aliis a Mogontiaco universas copias advenisse credentibus$$ Some Vascon infantry ,  levied by Galba ,  which had by this time been sent for ,  heard the noise of the combatants as they approached the camp ,  attacked the rear of the preoccupied enemy ,  and spread a panic more than proportionate to their numbers ,  some believing that all the troops from Novesium ,  others that all from Mogontiacum ,  had come up
 is error Romanis addit animos , et dum alienis viribus confidunt , suas recepere$$ This delusion restored the courage of the Romans ,  and in relying on the strength of others they recovered their own
 fortissimus quisque e Batavis , quantum peditum erat , funduntur eques evasit cum signis captivisque , quos prima acie corripuerant$$ All the bravest of the Batavians ,  of the infantry at least ,  fell ,  but the cavalry escaped with the standards and with the prisoners whom they had secured in the early part of the engagement
 caesorum eo die in partibus nostris maior numerus et imbellior , e Germanis ipsa robora$$ Of the slain on that day the greater number belonged to our army ,  but to its less effective part
 Dux uterque pari culpa meritus adversa prosperis defuere$$ The two generals were equally blameworthy
 nam Civilis si maioribus copiis instruxisset aciem , circumiri a tam paucis cohortibus nequisset castraque perrupta excidisset$$ they deserved defeat ,  they did not make the most of success
 Vocula nec adventum hostium exploravit , eoque simul egressus victusque$$ Had Civilis given battle in greater force ,  he could not have been outflanked by so small a number of cohorts ,  and he might have destroyed the camp after once forcing an entrance
 dein victoriae parum confisus , tritis frustra diebus castra in hostem movit , quem si statim impellere cursumque rerum sequi maturasset , solvere obsidium legionum eodem impetu potuit$$ As for Vocula ,  he did not reconnoitre the advancing enemy ,  and consequently he was vanquished as soon as be left the camp and then ,  mistrusting his victory ,  he fruitlessly wasted several days before marching against the enemy ,  though ,  had he at once resolved to drive them back ,  and to follow up his success ,  he might ,  by one and the same movement ,  have raised the siege of the legions
 temptaverat interim Civilis obsessorum animos , tamquam perditae apud Romanos res et suis victoria provenisset$$ Meanwhile Civilis had tried to work on the feelings of the besieged by representing that with the Romans all was lost ,  and that victory had declared for his own troops
 circumferebantur signa vexillaque , ostentati etiam captivi$$ The standards and colours were carried round the ramparts ,  and the prisoners also were displayed
 ex quibus unus , egregium facinus ausus , clara voce gesta patefecit , confossus illico a Germanis$$ One of them ,  with noble daring ,  declared the real truth in a loud voice ,  and ,  as he was cut down on the spot by the Germans ,  all the more confidence was felt in his information
 unde maior indici fides$$ At the same time it was becoming evident ,  from the devastation of the country and from the flames of burning houses ,  that the victorious army was approaching
 simul vastatione incendiisque flagrantium villarum venire victorem exercitum intellegebatur$$ Vocula issued orders that the standards should be planted within sight of the camp ,  and should be surrounded with a ditch and rampart ,  where his men might deposit their knapsacks ,  and so fight without encumbrance
 in conspectu castrorum constitui signa fossamque et vallum circumdari Vocula iubet$$ On this ,  the General was assailed by a clamorous demand for instant battle
 depositis impedimentis sarcinisque expediti certarent$$ They had now grown used to threaten
 hinc in ducem clamor pugnam poscentium$$ Without even taking time to form into line ,  disordered and weary as they were ,  they commenced the action
 et minari adsueverant$$ Civilis was on the field ,  trusting quite as much to the faults of his adversaries as to the valour of his own troops
 ne tempore quidem ad ordinandam aciem capto incompositi fessique proelium sumpsere$$ With the Romans the fortune of the day varied ,  and the most violently mutinous shewed themselves cowards
 nam Civilis aderat , non minus vitiis hostium quam virtute suorum fretus$$ But some ,  remembering their recent victory ,  stood their ground and struck fiercely at the foe ,  now encouraging each other and their neighbours ,  and now ,  while they re-formed their lines ,  imploring the besieged not to lose the opportunity
 varia apud Romanos fortuna et seditiosissimus quisque ignavus$$ These latter ,  who saw everything from the walls ,  sallied out from every gate
 quidam recentis victoriae memores retinere locum , ferire hostem , seque et proximos hortari et redintegrata acie manus ad obsessos tendere ne tempori deessent$$ It so happened that Civilis was thrown to the ground by the fall of his horse A report that he had been either wounded or slain gained belief throughout both armies ,  and spread incredible panic among his own troops ,  and gave as great encouragement to their opponents
 illi cuncta e muris cernentes omnibus portis prorumpunt$$ But Vocula ,  leaving the flying foe ,  began to strengthen the rampart and the towers of the camp ,  as if another siege were imminent
 ac forte Civilis lapsu equi prostratus , credita per utrumque exercitum fama vulneratum aut interfectum , immane quantum suis pavoris et hostibus alacritatis indidit$$ He had misused success so often that he was rightly suspected of a preference for war
 Nihil aeque exercitus nostros quam egestas copiarum fatigabat$$ Nothing distressed our troops so much as the scarcity of supplies
 impedimenta legionum cum imbelli turba Novaesium missa ut inde terrestri itinere frumentum adveherent$$ The baggage of the legions was therefore sent to Novesium with a crowd of non-combatants to fetch corn from that place overland ,  for the enemy commanded the river
 nam flumine hostes potiebantur$$ The march of the first body was accomplished in security ,  as Civilis had not yet recovered
 primum agmen securum incessit , nondum satis firmo Civile qui ubi rursum missos Novaesium frumentatores datasque in praesidium cohortis velut multa pace ingredi accepit , rarum apud signa militem , arma in vehiculis , cunctos licentia vagos , compositus invadit , praemissis qui pontis et viarum angusta insiderent$$ But when he heard that officers of the commissariat had been again sent to Novesium ,  and that the infantry detached as an escort were advancing just as if it were a time of profound peace ,  with but few soldiers round the standards ,  the arms stowed away in the wagons ,  and all wandering about at their pleasure ,  he attacked them in regular form ,  having first sent on troops to occupy the bridges and the defiles in the road
 pugnatum longo agmine et incerto Marte , donec proelium nox dirimeret$$ The battle extended over a long line of march ,  lasting with varying success till night parted the combatants
 cohortes Geldubam perrexere , manentibus , ut fuerant , castris , quae relictorum illic militum praesidio tenebantur$$ The infantry pushed on to Gelduba ,  while the camp remained in the same state as before ,  garrisoned by such troops as had been left in it
 non erat dubium quantum in regressu discriminis adeundum foret frumentatoribus onustis perculsisque$$ There could be no doubt what peril a convoy ,  heavily laden and panic-stricken ,  would have to encounter in attempting to return
 addit exercitui suo Vocula mille delectos e quinta et quinta decima legionibus apud Vetera obsessis , indomitum militem et ducibus infensum$$ Vocula added to his force a thousand picked men from the fifth and fifteenth legions besieged in the Old Camp ,  a body of troops undisciplined and ill-affected to their officers
 plures quam iussum erat profecti palam in agmine fremebant , non se ultra famem , insidias legatorum toleraturos$$ But more than the number specified came forward ,  and openly protested ,  as they marched ,  that they would not endure any longer the hardships of famine and the treachery of the legates
 at qui remanserant , desertos se abducta parte legionum querebantur$$ On the other hand ,  those who had stayed behind complained that they were ,  being left to their fate by this withdrawal of a part of the legions
 duplex hinc seditio , aliis revocantibus Voculam , aliis redire in castra abnuentibus$$ A twofold mutiny was the result ,  some calling upon Vocula to come back ,  while the others refused to return to the camp
 Interim Civilis Vetera circumsedit$$ Meanwhile Civilis blockaded the Old Camp
 Vocula Geldubam atque inde Novaesium concessit , Civilis capit Geldubam mox haud procul Novaesio equestri proelio prospere certavit$$ Vocula retired first to Gelduba ,  after ,  wards to Novesium Civilis took possession of Gelduba ,  and not long after was victorious in a cavalry engagement near Novesium
 sed miles secundis adversisque perinde in exitium ducum accendebatur$$ But reverses and successes seemed equally to kindle in the troops the one desire of murdering their officers
 et adventu quintanorum quintadecimanorumque auctae legiones donativum exposcunt , comperto pecuniam a Vitellio missam$$ The legions ,  increased in number by the arrival of the men from the fifth and fifteenth ,  demanded a donative ,  for they had discovered that some money had been sent by Vitellius
 nec diu cunctatus Hordeonius nomine Vespasiani dedit , idque praecipuum fuit seditionis alimentum$$ After a short delay Hordeonius gave the donative in the name of Vespasian This ,  more than anything else ,  fostered the mutinous spirit
 effusi in luxum et epulas et nocturnos coetus veterem in Hordeonium iram renovant , nec ullo legatorum tribunorumve obsistere auso (quippe omnem pudorem nox ademerat) protractum e cubili interficiunt$$ The men ,  abandoning themselves to debauchery and revelry and all the license of nightly gatherings ,  revived their old grudge against Hordeonius Without a single legate or tribune venturing to check them ,  for the darkness seems to have taken from them all sense of shame ,  they dragged him out of his bed and killed him
 eadem in Voculam parabantur , nisi servili habitu per tenebras ignoratus evasisset$$ The same fate was intended for Vocula ,  but he assumed the dress of a slave ,  and escaped unrecognized in the darkness
 Vbi sedato impetu metus rediit , centuriones cum epistulis ad civitates Galliarum misere , auxilia ac stipendia oraturos ipsi , ut est vulgus sine rectore praeceps pavidum socors , adventante Civile raptis temere armis ac statim omissis , in fugam vertuntur$$ These men ,  headstrong ,  cowardly ,  and spiritless ,  as a mob without a leader always is ,  on the approach of Civilis hastily took up arms ,  and ,  as hastily abandoning them ,  betook themselves to flight Disaster produced disunion ,  the troops from the Upper army dissociating their cause from that of their comrades
 res adversae discordiam peperere , iis qui e superiore exercitu erant causam suam dissociantibus$$ Nevertheless the statues of Vitellius were again set up in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgian towns ,  and this at a time when Vitellius himself had fallen
 Vitellii tamen imagines in castris et per proximas Belgarum civitates repositae , cum iam Vitellius occidisset dein mutati in paenitentiam primani quartanique et duoetvicensimani Voculam sequuntur , apud quem resumpto Vespasiani sacramento ad liberandum Mogontiaci obsidium ducebantur$$ Then the men of the 1st ,  the 4th ,  and the 18th legions ,  repenting of their conduct ,  followed Vocula ,  and again taking in his presence the oath of allegiance to Vespasian ,  were marched by him to the relief of Mogontiacum The besieging army ,  an heterogeneous mass of Chatti ,  Usipii ,  and Mattiaci ,  had raised the siege ,  glutted with spoils ,  but not without suffering loss
 discesserant obsessores , mixtus ex Chattis Vsipis Mattiacis exercitus , satietate praedae nec incruenti in via dispersos et nescios miles noster invaserat quin et loricam vallumque per finis suos Treviri struxere , magnisque in vicem cladibus cum Germanis certabant , donec egregia erga populum Romanum merita mox rebelles foedarent$$ Our troops attacked them on the way ,  dispersed and unprepared Moreover the Treveri had constructed a breastwork and rampart across their territory ,  and they and the Germans continued to contend with great losses on both sides up to the time when they tarnished by rebellion their distinguished services to the Roman people
 Interea Vespasianus iterum ac Titus consulatum absentes inierunt , maesta et multiplici metu suspensa civitate , quae super instantia mala falsos pavores induerat , descivisse Africam res novas moliente Lucius Pisone$$ Meanwhile Vespasian (now consul for the second time) and Titus entered upon their office ,  both being absent from Rome People were gloomy and anxious under the pressure of manifold fears ,  for ,  over and above immediate perils ,  they had taken groundless alarm under the impression that Africa was in rebellion through the revolutionary movements of Lucius Piso
 is <pro consule> provinciae nequaquam turbidus ingenio$$ He was governor of that province ,  and was far from being a man of turbulent disposition
 sed quia naves saevitia hiemis prohibebantur , vulgus alimenta in dies mercari solitum , cui una ex re publica annonae cura , clausum litus , retineri commeatus , dum timet , credebat , augentibus famam Vitellianis , qui studium partium nondum posuerant , ne victoribus quidem ingrato rumore , quorum cupiditates externis quoque bellis inexplebilis nulla umquam civilis victoria satiavit$$ The fact was that the wheat-ships were detained by the severity of the weather ,  and the lower orders ,  who were accustomed to buy their provisions from day to day ,  and to whom cheap corn was the sole subject of public interest ,  feared and believed that the ports had been closed and the supplies stopped ,  the Vitellianists ,  who had not yet given up their party feelings ,  helping to spread the report ,  which was not displeasing even to the conquerors Their ambition ,  which even foreign campaigns could not fill to the full ,  was not satisfied by any triumphs that civil war could furnish
 Kalendis Ianuariis in senatu , quem Iulius Frontinus praetor urbanus vocaverat , legatis exercitibusque ac regibus laudes gratesque decretae$$ On the 1st of January ,  at a meeting of the Senate ,  convoked for the purpose by Julius Frontinus ,  praetor of the city ,  votes of thanks were passed to the legates ,  to the armies ,  and to the allied kings
 Tettio Iuliano praetura , tamquam transgredientem in partis Vespasiani legionem deseruisset , ablata ut in Plotium Grypum transferretur$$ The office of praetor was taken away from Tettius Julianus ,  as having deserted his legion when it passed over to the party of Vespasian ,  with a view to its being transferred to Plotius Griphus
 Hormo dignitas equestris data$$ Equestrian rank was conferred on Hormus
 et mox eiurante Frontino Caesar Domitianus praeturam cepit$$ Then ,  on the resignation of Frontinus ,  Caesar Domitian assumed the office of praetor of the city
 eius nomen epistulis edictisque praeponebatur , vis penes Mucianum erat , nisi quod pleraque Domitianus instigantibus amicis aut propria libidine audebat$$ His name was put at the head of despatches and edicts ,  but the real authority was in the hands of Mucianus ,  with this exception ,  that Domitian ventured on several acts of power ,  at the instigation of his friends ,  or at his own caprice
 sed praecipuus Muciano metus e Primo Antonio Varoque Arrio , quos recentis clarosque rerum fama ac militum studiis etiam populus fovebat , quia in neminem ultra aciem saevierant$$ But Mucianus found his principal cause of apprehension in Primus Antonius and Varus Arrius ,  who ,  in the freshness of their fame ,  while distinguished by great achievements and by the attachment of the soldiery ,  were also supported by the people ,  because in no case had they extended their severities beyond the battle-field
 et ferebatur Antonius Scribonianum Crassum , egregiis maioribus et fraterna imagine fulgentem , ad capessendam rem publicam hortatus , haud defutura consciorum manu , ni Scribonianus abnuisset , ne paratis quidem corrumpi facilis , adeo metuens incerta$$ It was also reported that Antonius had urged Scribonianus Crassus ,  whom an illustrious descent added to the honours of his brother made a conspicuous person ,  to assume the supreme power and it was understood that a number of accomplices would not have failed to support him ,  had not the proposal been rejected by Scribonianus ,  who was a man not easily to be tempted even by a certainty ,  and was proportionately apprehensive of risk
 igitur Mucianus , quia propalam opprimi Antonius nequibat , multis in senatu laudibus cumulatum secretis promissis onerat , citeriorem Hispaniam ostentans discessu Cluvii Rufi vacuam$$ Mucianus ,  seeing that Antonius could not be openly crushed ,  heaped many praises upon him in the Senate ,  and loaded him with promises in secret ,  holding out as a prize the government of Eastern Spain ,  then vacant in consequence of the departure of Cluvius Rufus
 simul amicis eius tribunatus praefecturasque largitur$$ At the same time he lavished on his friends tribuneships and prefectures
 dein postquam inanem animum spe et cupidine impleverat , viris abolet dimissa in hiberna legione septima , cuius flagrantissimus in Antonium amor$$ and then ,  when he had filled the vain heart of the man with hope and ambition ,  he destroyed his power by sending into winter quarters the 7th legion ,  whose affection for Antonius was particularly vehement

 pars exercitus in Germanias ducebatur$$ Part of the army was on its way to Germany
 sic egesto quidquid turbidum redit urbi sua forma legesque et munia magistratuum$$ Thus all elements of disturbance being removed ,  the usual appearance of the capital ,  the laws ,  and the jurisdiction of the magistrates ,  were once more restored
 Senatus inchoantibus primoribus ius iurandum concepit quo certatim omnes magistratus , ceteri , ut sententiam rogabantur , deos testis advocabant , nihil ope sua factum quo cuiusquam salus laederetur , neque se praemium aut honorem ex calamitate civium cepisse , trepidis et verba iuris iurandi per varias artis mutantibus , quis flagitii conscientia inerat$$ The Senate ,  led by its principal members ,  then framed a form of oath ,  which was eagerly taken by all the magistrates and by the other Senators in the order in which they voted They called the Gods to witness ,  that nothing had been done by their instrumentality to prejudice the safety of any person ,  and that they had gained no distinction or advantage by the ruin of Roman citizens Great was the alarm ,  and various the devices for altering the words of the oath ,  among those who felt the consciousness of guilt
 probabant religionem patres , periurium arguebant$$ The Senate appreciated the scruple ,  but denounced the perjury
 eaque velut censura in Sariolenum Voculam et Nonium Attianum et Cestium Severum acerrime incubuit , crebris apud Neronem delationibus famosos$$ This public censure ,  as it might be called ,  fell with especial severity on three men ,  Sariolenus Vocula ,  Nonnius Attianus ,  and Cestius Severus ,  all of them infamous for having practised the trade of the informer in the days of Nero
 Sariolenum et recens crimen urgebat , quod apud Vitellium molitus eadem foret$$ Sariolenus indeed laboured under an imputation of recent date
 nec destitit senatus manus intentare Voculae , donec curia excederet$$ It was said that he had attempted the same practices during the reign of Vitellius
 ad Paccium Africanum transgressi eum quoque proturbant , tamquam Neroni Scribonios fratres concordia opibusque insignis ad exitium monstravisset$$ The Senators did not desist from threatening gestures ,  till he quitted the chamber then passing to Paccius Africanus ,  they assailed him in the same way
 Africanus neque fateri audebat neque abnuere poterat$$ It was he ,  they said ,  who had singled out as victims for Nero the brothers Scribonius ,  renowned for their mutual affection and for their wealth
 in Vibium Crispum , cuius interrogationibus fatigabatur , ultro conversus , miscendo quae defendere nequibat , societate culpae invidiam declinavit$$ Africanus dared not confess his guilt ,  and could not deny it but he himself turned on Vibius Crispus ,  who was pressing him with questions ,  and complicating a charge which he could not rebut ,  shifted the blame from himself by associating another with his guilt
 Magnam eo die pietatis eloquentiaeque famam Vipstanus Messala adeptus est , nondum senatoria aetate , ausus pro fratre Aquilio Regulo deprecari$$ Great was the reputation for brotherly affection ,  as well as for eloquence ,  which Vipstanus Messalla earned for himself on that day ,  by venturing ,  though not yet of Senatorial age ,  to plead for his brother Aquilius Regulus
 Regulum subversa Crassorum et Orfiti domus in summum odium extulerat$$ The fall of the families of the Crassi and Orfitus had brought Regulus into the utmost odium
 sponte ex sc accusationem subisse iuvenis admodum , nec depellendi periculi sed in spem potentiae videbatur$$ Of his own free will ,  as it seemed ,  and while still a mere youth ,  he had undertaken the prosecution ,  not to ward off any peril from himself ,  but in the hope of gaining power
 et Sulpicia Praetextata Crassi uxor quattuorque liberi , si cognosceret senatus , ultores aderant$$ The wife of Crassus ,  Sulpicia Praetextata ,  and her four children were ready ,  should the Senate take cognizance of the cause ,  to demand vengeance
 igitur Messala non causam neque reum tueri , sed periculis fratris semet opponens flexerat quosdam$$ Accordingly ,  Messalla ,  without attempting to defend the case or the person accused ,  had simply thrown himself in the way of the perils that threatened his brother ,  and had thus wrought upon the feelings of several Senators
 occurrit truci oratione Curtius Montanus , eo usque progressus ut post caedem Galbae datam interfectori Pisonis pecuniam a Regulo adpetitumque morsu Pisonis caput obiectaret$$ On this Curtius Montanus met him with a fierce speech ,  in which he went to the length of asserting ,  that after the death of Galba ,  money had been given by Regulus to the murderer of Piso ,  and that he had even fastened his teeth in the murdered man's head
 hoc certe inquit Nero non coegit , nec dignitatem aut salutem illa saevitia redemisti$$ Certainly ,  he said ,  Nero did not compel this act
 sane toleremus istorum defensiones qui perdere alios quam periclitari ipsi maluerunt$$ you did not secure by this piece of barbarity either your rank or your life
 te securum reliquerat exul pater et divisa inter creditores bona , nondum honorum capax aetas , nihil quod ex te concupisceret Nero , nihil quod timeret$$ We may bear with the defence put forward by men who thought it better to destroy others than to come into peril themselves
 libidine sanguinis et hiatu praemiorum ignotum adhuc ingenium et nullis defensionibus expertum caede nobili imbuisti , cum ex funere rei publicae raptis consularibus spoliis , septuagiens sestertio saginatus et sacerdotio fulgens innoxios pueros , inlustris senes , conspicuas feminas eadem ruina prosterneres , cum segnitiam Neronis incusares , quod per singulas domos seque et delatores fatigaret posse universum senatum una voce subverti retinete , patres conscripti , et reservate hominem tam expediti consilii ut omnis aetas instructa sit , et quo modo senes nostri Marcellum , Crispum , iuvenes Regulum imitentur$$ As for you ,  the exile of your father ,  and the division of his property among his creditors ,  had left you perfectly safe ,  besides that your youth incapacitated you for office there was nothing in you which Nero could either covet or dread It was from sheer lust of slaughter and greed of gain that you ,  unknown as you were ,  you ,  who had never pleaded in any man's defence ,  steeped your soul in noble blood ,  when ,  though you had snatched from the very grave of your Country the spoils of a man of consular rank ,  had been fed to the full with seven million sesterces ,  and shone with all sacerdotal honours ,  you yet overwhelmed in one common ruin innocent boys ,  old men of illustrious name ,  and noble ladies ,  when you actually blamed the tardy movements of Nero in wearying himself and his informers with the overthrow of single families ,  and declared that the whole Senate might be destroyed by one word
 invenit aemulos etiam infelix nequitia$$ Keep ,  Conscript Fathers ,  preserve a man of such ready counsels ,  that every age may be furnished with its teacher ,  and that our young men may imitate Regulus ,  just as our old men imitate Marcellus and Crispus
 quid si floreat vigeatque$$ Even unsuccessful villany finds some to emulate it 
 et quem adhuc quaestorium offendere non audemus , praetorium et consularem ausuri sumus$$  what will happen ,  if it flourish and be strong
 an Neronem extremum dominorum putatis$$ And the man ,  whom we dare not offend when he holds only quaestor's rank ,  are we to see him rise to the dignities of praetor and consul
 idem crediderant qui Tiberio , qui Gaio superstites fuerunt , cum interim intestabilior et saevior exortus est$$ Do you suppose that Nero will be the last of the tyrants
 non timemus Vespasianum$$ Those who survived Tiberius ,  those who survived Caligula ,  thought the same
 ea principis aetas , ea moderatio$$ and yet after each there arose another ruler yet more detestable and more cruel
 sed diutius durant exempla quam mores$$ We are not afraid of Vespasian
 elanguimus , patres conscripti , nec iam ille senatus sumus qui occiso Nerone delatores et ministros more maiorum puniendos flagitabat$$ the age and moderation of the new Emperor reassure us
 optimus est post malum principem dies primus$$ But the influence of an example outlives the individual character
 Tanto cum adsensu senatus auditus est Montanus ut spem caperet Helvidius posse etiam Marcellum prosterni$$ Montanus was heard with such approval on the part of the Senate ,  that Helvidius conceived a hope that Marcellus also might be overthrown
 igitur a laude Cluvii Rufi orsus , qui perinde dives et eloquentia clarus nulli umquam sub Nerone periculum facessisset , crimine simul exemploque Eprium urgebat , ardentibus patrum animis$$ He therefore began with a panegyric on Cluvius Rufus ,  who ,  though not less rich nor less renowned for eloquence ,  had never imperilled a single life in the days of Nero By this comparison ,  as well as by direct accusations ,  he pressed Eprius hard ,  and stirred the indignation of the Senators
 quod ubi sensit Marcellus , velut excedens curia imus inquit , Prisce , et relinquimus tibi senatum tuum$$ When Marcellus perceived this ,  he made as if he would leave the House ,  exclaiming ,  We go ,  Priscus ,  and leave you your Senate
 regna praesente Caesare$$ act the king ,  though Caesar himself be present
 sequebatur Vibius Crispus , ambo infensi , vultu diverso , Marcellus minacibus oculis , Crispus renidens , donec adcursu amicorum retraherentur$$ Crispus followed Both were enraged ,  but their looks were different Marcellus cast furious glances about him ,  while Crispus smiled They were drawn back ,  however ,  into the Senate by the hasty interference of friends
 cum glisceret certamen , hinc multi bonique , inde pauci et validi pertinacibus odiis tenderent , consumptus per discordiam dies$$ The contest grew fiercer ,  while the well-disposed majority on the one side ,  and a powerful minority on the other ,  fought out their obstinate quarrel ,  and thus the day was spent in altercation
 Proximo senatu , inchoante Caesare de abolendo dolore iraque et priorum temporum necessitatibus , censuit Mucianus prolixe pro accusatoribus$$ At the next meeting of the Senate Caesar began by recommending that the wrongs ,  the resentments ,  and the terrible necessities of former times ,  should be forgotten ,  and Mucianus spoke at great length in favour of the informers
 simul eos qui coeptam , deinde omissam actionem repeterent , monuit sermone molli et tamquam rogaret$$ At the same time he admonished in gentle terms and in a tone of entreaty those who were reviving indictments ,  which they had before commenced and afterwards dropped
 patres coeptatam libertatem , postquam obviam itum , omisere$$ The Senators ,  when they found themselves opposed ,  relinquished the liberty which they had begun to exercise
 Mucianus , ne sperni senatus iudicium et cunctis sub Nerone admissis data impunitas videretur , Octavium Sagittam et Antistium Sosianum senatorii ordinis egressos exilium in easdem insulas redegit$$ That it might not be thought that the opinion of the Senate was disregarded ,  or that impunity was accorded to all acts done in the days of Nero ,  Mucianus sent back to their islands two men of Senatorial rank ,  Octavius Sagitta and Antistius Sosianus ,  who had quitted their places of banishment
 Octavius Pontiam Postuminam , stupro cognitam et nuptias suas abnuentem , impotens amoris interfecerat , Sosianus pravitate morum multis exitiosus$$ Octavius had seduced one Pontia Postumia ,  and ,  on her refusing to marry him ,  in the frenzy of passion had murdered her Sosianus by his depravity had brought many to ruin
 ambo gravi senatus consulto damnati pulsique , quamvis concesso aliis reditu , in eadem poena retenti sunt$$ Both had been condemned and banished by a solemn decision of the Senate ,  and ,  though others were permitted to return ,  were kept under the same penalty
 nec ideo lenita erga Mucianum invidia$$ But this did not mitigate the hatred felt against Mucianus
 quippe Sosianus ac Sagitta viles , etiam si reverterentur$$ Sosianus and Sagitta were utterly insignificant ,  even if they did return
 accusatorum ingenia et opes et exercita malis artibus potentia timebantur$$ but men dreaded the abilities of the informers ,  their wealth ,  and the power which they exercised in many sinister ways
 Inter quae militaris seditio prope exarsit$$ Amidst all this a mutiny in the army all but broke out
 praetorianam militiam repetebant a Vitellio dimissi , pro Vespasiano congregati$$ The troops who ,  having been disbanded by Vitellius ,  had flocked to support Vespasian ,  asked leave to serve again in the Praetorian Guard ,  and the soldiers who had been selected from the legions with the same prospect now clamoured for their promised pay
 et lectus in eandem spem e legionibus miles promissa stipendia flagitabat$$ Even the Vitellianists could not be got rid of without much bloodshed
 ne Vitelliani quidem sine multa caede pelli poterant$$ But the money required for retaining in the service so vast a body of men was immensely large
 sed immensa pecunia tanta vis hominum retinenda erat$$ Mucianus entered the camp to examine more accurately the individual claims
 ingressus castra Mucianus , quo rectius stipendia singulorum spectaret , suis cum insignibus armisque victores constituit , modicis inter se spatiis discretos$$ The victorious army ,  wearing their proper decorations and arms ,  he drew up with moderate intervals of space between the divisions
 tum Vitelliani , quos apud Bovillas in deditionem acceptos memoravimus , ceterique per urbem et urbi vicina conquisiti producuntur prope intecto corpore$$ then the Vitellianists ,  whose capitulation at Bovillae I have already related ,  and the other troops of the party ,  who had been collected from the capital and its neighbourhood ,  were brought forth almost naked
 eos Mucianus diduci et Germanicum Britannicumque militem , ac si qui aliorum exercituum , separatim adsistere iubet$$ Mucianus ordered these men to be drawn up apart ,  making the British ,  the German ,  and any other troops that there were belonging to other armies ,  take up separate positions
 illos primus statim aspectus obstupefecerat , cum ex diverso velut aciem telis et armis trucem , semet clausos nudosque et inluvie deformis aspicerent$$ The very first view of their situation paralyzed them They saw opposed to them what seemed a hostile array ,  threatening them with javelin and sword
 ut vero huc illuc distrahi coepere , metus per omnis et praecipua Germanici militis formido , tamquam ea separatione ad caedem destinaretur$$ They saw themselves hemmed in ,  without arms ,  filthy and squalid And when they began to be separated ,  some to be marched to one spot ,  and some to another ,  a thrill of terror ran through them all
 prensare commanipularium pectora , cervicibus innecti , suprema oscula petere , ne desererentur soli neu pari causa disparem fortunam paterentur$$ Among the troops from Germany the panic was particularly great for they believed that this separation marked them out for slaughter
 modo Mucianum , modo absentem principem , postremum caelum ac deos obtestari , donec Mucianus cunctos eiusdem sacramenti , eiusdem imperatoris milites appellans , falso timori obviam iret$$ They embraced their fellow soldiers ,  clung to their necks ,  begged for parting kisses ,  and entreated that they might not be deserted ,  or doomed in a common cause to suffer a different lot
 namque et victor exercitus clamore lacrimas eorum iuvabat isque finis illa die$$ They invoked now Mucianus ,  now the absent Emperor ,  and ,  as a last resource ,  heaven and the Gods ,  till Mucianus came forward ,  and calling them soldiers bound by the same oath and servants of the same Emperor ,  stopped the groundless panic
 paucis post diebus adloquentem Domitianum firmati iam excepere$$ And indeed the victorious army seconded the tears of the vanquished with their approving shouts
 spernunt oblatos agros , militiam et stipendia orant$$ This terminated the proceedings for that day
 preces erant , sed quibus contra dici non posset$$ But when Domitian harangued them a few days afterwards ,  they received him with increased confidence
 igitur in praetorium accepti$$ The land that was offered them they contemptuously rejected ,  and begged for regular service and pay
 dein quibus aetas et iusta stipendia , dimissi cum honore , alii ob culpam , sed carptim ac singuli , quo tutissimo remedio consensus multitudinis extenuatur$$ Theirs were prayers indeed ,  but such as it was impossible to reject They were therefore received into the Praetorian camp
 Ceterum verane pauperie an uti videretur , actum in senatu ut sescentiens sestertium a privatis mutuum acciperetur , praepositusque ei curae Pompeius Silvanus$$ It is a fact that ,  whether suggested by real poverty or by a wish to give the appearance of it ,  a proposition passed the Senate to the effect that a loan of sixty million sesterces from private persons should be accepted
 nec multo post necessitas abiit sive omissa simulatio abrogati inde legem ferente Domitiano consulatus quos Vitellius dederat , funusque censorium Flavio Sabino ductum , magna documenta instabilis fortunae summaque et ima miscentis$$ Pompeius Silvanus was appointed to manage the affair Before long ,  either the necessity ceased or the pretence was dropped After this ,  on the motion of Domitian ,  the consulships conferred by Vitellius were cancelled ,  and the honours of a censor's funeral were paid to Sabinus great lessons both of the mutability of fortune ,  ever bringing together the highest honours and the lowest humiliations
 Sub idem tempus Lucius Piso pro consule interficitur$$ About the same time the proconsul Lucius Piso was murdered
 ea de caede quam verissime expediam , si pauca supra repetiero ab initio causisque talium facinorum non absurda$$ I shall make the account of this murder as exact as possible by first reviewing a few earlier circumstances ,  which have a bearing on the origin and motives of such deeds
 legio in Africa auxiliaque tutandis imperii finibus sub divo Augusto Tiberioque principibus proconsuli parebant$$ The legion and the auxiliaries stationed in Africa to guard the frontiers of the Empire were under the proconsul's authority during the reigns of the divine Augustus and Tiberius
 mox G Caesar , turbidus animi ac Marcum Silanum obtinentem Africam metuens , ablatam proconsuli legionem misso in eam rem legato tradidit$$ But in course of time Caligula ,  prompted by his restless temper and by his fear of Marcus Silanus ,  who then held Africa ,  took away the legion from the proconsul ,  and handed it over to a legate whom he sent for that purpose
 aequatus inter duos beneficiorum numerus , et mixtis utriusque mandatis discordia quaesita auctaque pravo certamine$$ The patronage was equally divided between the two officers A source of disagreement was thus studiously sought in the continual clashing of their authority ,  and it was further developed by an unprincipled rivalry
 legatorum ius adolevit diuturnitate officii , vel quia minoribus maior aemulandi cura , proconsulum splendidissimus quisque securitati magis quam potentiae consulebant$$ The power of the legates grew through their lengthened tenure of office ,  and ,  perhaps ,  because an inferior feels greater interest in such a competition All the more distinguished of the proconsuls cared more for security than for power
 Sed tum legionem in Africa regebat Valerius Festus , sumptuosae adulescentiae neque modica cupiens et adfinitate Vitellii anxius$$ At this time the legion in Africa was commanded by Valerius Festus ,  a young man of extravagant habits and immoderate ambition ,  who was now made uneasy by his relationship to Vitellius
 is crebris sermonibus temptaveritne Pisonem ad res novas an temptanti restiterit , incertum , quoniam secreto eorum nemo adfuit , et occiso Pisone plerique ad gratiam interfectoris inclinavere$$ Whether this man in their frequent interviews tempted Piso to revolt ,  or whether he resisted such overtures ,  is not known for certain ,  for no one was present at their confidential meetings ,  and ,  after Piso's death ,  many were disposed to ingratiate themselves with the murderer
 nec ambigitur provinciam et militem alienato erga Vespasianum animo fuisse et quidam e Vitellianis urbe profugi ostentabant Pisoni nutantis Gallias , paratam Germaniam , pericula ipsius et in pace suspecto tutius bellum$$ There is no doubt that the province and the troops entertained feelings of hostility to Vespasian ,  and some of the Vitellianists ,  who had escaped from the capital ,  incessantly represented to Piso that Gaul was hesitating and Germany ready to revolt ,  that his own position was perilous ,  and that for one who in peace must be suspected ,  war was the safer course

 cecidisse Galerianum consobrinum eius generumque$$ He declared that an order to put Piso to death had been given to the centurion ,  and that Galerianus ,  his cousin and son-in-law ,  had perished
 unam in audacia spem salutis , sed duo itinera audendi , seu mallet statim arma , seu petita navibus Gallia ducem se Vitellianis exercitibus ostenderet$$ that his only hope of safety was in bold action that in such action two paths were open he might defend himself on the spot ,  or he might sail for Gaul and offer his services as general to the Vitellianist armies
 nihil ad ea moto Pisone , centurio a Muciano missus , ut portum Carthaginis attigit , magna voce laeta Pisoni omnia tamquam principi continuare , obvios et subitae rei miraculo attonitos ut eadem adstreperent hortari$$ Piso was wholly unmoved by this statement The centurion despatched by Mucianus ,  on landing in the port of Carthage ,  raised his voice ,  and invoked in succession all blessings on the head of Piso ,  as if he were Emperor ,  and bade the bystanders ,  who were astonished by this sudden and strange proceeding ,  take up the same cry
 vulgus credulum ruere in forum , praesentiam Pisonis exposcere$$ The credulous mob rushed into the market-place ,  and demanded that Piso should shew himself
 gaudio clamoribusque cuncta miscebant , indiligentia veri et adulandi libidine$$ They threw everything into an uproar with their clamorous shouts of joy ,  careless of the truth ,  and only eager to flatter
 Piso indicio Sagittae vel insita modestia non in publicum egressus est neque se studiis vulgi permisit$$ Piso ,  acting on the information of Sagitta ,  or ,  perhaps ,  from natural modesty ,  would not make his appearance in public ,  or trust himself to the zeal of the populace
 centurionemque percontatus , postquam quaesitum sibi crimen caedemque comperit , animadverti in eum iussit , haud perinde spe vitae quam ira in percussorem , quod idem ex interfectoribus Clodii Macri cruentas legati sanguine manus ad caedem proconsulis rettulisset$$ On questioning the centurion ,  and finding that he had sought a pretext for accusing and murdering him ,  he ordered the man to be executed ,  moved ,  not so much by any hope of saving his life ,  as by indignation against the assassin for this fellow had been one of the murderers of Macer ,  and was now come to slay the proconsul with hands already stained with the blood of the legate
 anxio deinde edicto Carthaginiensibus increpitis , ne solita quidem munia usurpabat , clausus intra domum , ne qua motus novi causa vel forte oreretur$$ He then severely blamed the people of Carthage in an edict which betrayed his anxiety ,  and ceased to discharge even the usual duties of his office ,  shutting himself up in his palace ,  to guard against any casual occurrence that might lead to a new outbreak
 Sed ubi Festo consternatio vulgi , centurionis supplicium veraque et falsa more famae in maius innotuere , equites in necem Pisonis mittit$$ But when the agitation of the people ,  the execution of the centurion ,  and other news ,  true or false ,  exaggerated as usual by report ,  came to the ears of Festus ,  he sent some cavalry to put Piso to death
 illi raptim vecti obscuro adhuc coeptae lucis domum proconsulis inrumpunt destrictis gladiis , et magna pars Pisonis ignari , quod Poenos auxiliaris Maurosque in eam caedem delegerat$$ They rode over at full speed ,  and broke into the dwelling of the proconsul in the dim light of early dawn ,  with their swords drawn in their hands Many of them were unacquainted with the person of Piso ,  for the legate had selected some Moorish and Carthaginian auxiliaries to perpetrate the deed
 haud procul cubiculo obvium forte servum quisnam et ubi esset Piso interrogavere$$ Near the proconsul's chamber they chanced to meet a slave ,  and asked him who he was ,  and where Piso was to be found
 servus egregio mendacio se Pisonem esse respondit ac statim obtruncatur$$ The slave with a noble untruth replied ,  I am he ,  and was immediately cut down
 nec multo post Piso interficitur namque aderat qui nosceret , Baebius Massa e procuratoribus Africae , iam tunc optimo cuique exitiosus et inter causas malorum quae mox tulimus saepius rediturus$$ Soon after Piso was killed ,  for there was on the spot one who recognized him ,  Baebius Massa ,  one of the procurators of Africa ,  a name even then fatal to the good ,  and destined often to reappear among the causes of the sufferings which he had ere long to endure
 Festus Adrumeto , ubi speculabundus substiterat , ad legionem contendit praefectumque castrorum Caetronium Pisanum vinciri iussit proprias ob simultates , sed Pisonis satellitem vocabat militesque et centuriones quosdam puniit , alios praemiis adfecit , neutrum ex merito , sed ut oppressisse bellum crederetur$$ From Adrumetum ,  where he had stayed to watch the result ,  Festus went to the legion ,  and gave orders that Cetronius Pisanus ,  prefect of the camp ,  should be put in irons He did this out of private pique ,  but he called the man an accomplice of Piso Some few centurions and soldiers he punished ,  others he rewarded ,  neither the one nor the other deservedly ,  but he wished men to believe that he had extinguished a war
 mox Oeensium Lepcitanorumque discordias componit , quae raptu frugum et pecorum inter agrestis modicis principiis , iam per arma atque acies exercebantur$$ He then put an end to a quarrel between the Censes and the Leptitani ,  which ,  originating in robberies of corn and cattle by two rustic populations ,  had grown from this insignificant beginning till it was carried on in pitched battles
 nam populus Oeensis multitudine inferior Garamantas exciverat , gentem indomitam et inter accolas latrociniis fecundam$$ The people of Ceea ,  who were inferior in numbers ,  had summoned to their aid the Garamantes ,  a wild race incessantly occupied in robbing their neighbours
 unde artae Lepcitanis res , lateque vastatis agris intra moenia trepidabant , donec interventu cohortium alarumque fusi Garamantes et recepta omnis praeda , nisi quam vagi per inaccessa mapalium ulterioribus vendiderant$$ This had brought the Leptitani to extremities their territories had been ravaged far and wide ,  and they were trembling within their walls ,  when the Garamantes were put to flight by the arrival of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry ,  and the whole of the booty was recaptured ,  with the exception of some which the plunderers ,  in their wanderings through inaccessible hamlets ,  had sold to more distant tribes
 Curam restituendi Capitolii in Lucium Vestinum confert , equestris ordinis virum , sed auctoritate famaque inter proceres$$ The work of rebuilding the Capitol was assigned by him to Lucius Vestinius ,  a man of the Equestrian order ,  who ,  however ,  for high character and reputation ranked among the nobles

 ite , nuntiate Vespasiano vel , quod propius est , Civili et Classico , relictum a vobis in acie ducem$$ There is no treachery here I have nothing to excuse but that I rashly believed that you ,  forgetting your alliance with Gaul ,  had again recollected your allegiance to Rome
 venient legiones quae neque me inultum neque vos impunitos patiantur$$ I shall be added to the number of the Numisii and Herennii ,  so that all your commanders will have fallen by the hands of their soldiers or of the enemy

 consistunt per cohortis et manipulos$$ The troops formed themselves in cohorts and companies ,  for they could not deploy into line
 neque enim poterat patescere acies effuso hoste et impedientibus tentoriis sarcinisque , cum intra vallum pugnaretur$$ as the enemy were scattered everywhere ,  while from the fact that the battle was raging within the entrenchments ,  they were themselves hampered with their tents and baggage
 Tutor et Classicus et Civilis suis quisque locis pugnam ciebant , Gallos pro libertate , Batavos pro gloria , Germanos ad praedam instigantes$$ Tutor ,  Classicus ,  and Civilis ,  each at his post ,  animated the combatants the Gauls they urged to fight for freedom ,  the Batavi for glory ,  the Germans for plunder
 et cuncta pro hostibus erant , donec legio unaetvicensima patentiore quam ceterae spatio conglobata sustinuit ruentis , mox impulit$$ Everything seemed in favour of the enemy ,  till the 21st legion ,  having more room than the others ,  formed itself into a compact body ,  withstood ,  and soon drove back the assailants
 nec sine ope divina mutatis repente animis terga victores vertere$$ Nor was it without an interposition of heaven ,  that by a sudden change of temper the conquerors turned their backs and fled
 ipsi territos se cohortium aspectu ferebant , quae primo impetu disiectae summis rursus iugis congregabantur ac speciem novi auxilii fecerant$$ Their own account was ,  that they were alarmed by the sight of the cohorts ,  which ,  after being broken at the first onset ,  rallied on the top of the hills ,  and presented the appearance of reinforcements
 sed obstitit vincentibus pravum inter ipsos certamen omisso hoste spolia consectandi$$ What checked them in their course of victory was a mischievous struggle among themselves to secure plunder while they forgot the enemy

 unde metus et iustae preces invocantium , antequam hostes reparatis viribus ad spem vel ad ultionem accingerentur$$ Hence their alarm and reasonable importunity in begging for help ,  before the enemy ,  recovering their strength ,  could raise their spirits for a new effort or for thoughts of revenge
 namque et Civilis illuc intenderat , non invalidus , flagrantissima cohortium suarum integra , quae e Chaucis Frisiisque composita Tolbiaci in finibus Agrippinensium agebat$$ And indeed Civilis had marched in their direction ,  nor was he by any means weak ,  as he had still ,  in unbroken force ,  the most warlike of his cohorts ,  which consisted of Chauci and Frisii ,  and which was posted at Tolbiacum ,  on the frontiers of the Agrippinenses
 sed tristis nuntius avertit , deletam cohortem dolo Agrippinensium , qui largis epulis vinoque sopitos Germanos , clausis foribus , igne iniecto cremavere$$ He was ,  however ,  diverted from his purpose by the deplorable news that this cohort had been entirely destroyed by a stratagem of the Agrippinenses ,  who ,  having stupefied the Germans by a profuse entertainment and abundance of wine ,  fastened the doors ,  set fire to the houses ,  and burned them
 simul Cerialis propero agmine subvenit$$ At the same time Cerialis advanced by forced marches ,  and relieved the city

 Isdem diebus Mucianus Vitellii filium interfici iubet , mansuram discordiam obtendens , ni semina belli restinxisset$$ About the same time Mucianus ordered the son of Vitellius to be put to death ,  alleging that dissension would never cease ,  if he did not destroy all seeds of civil war
 neque Antonium Primum adsciri inter comites a Domitiano passus est , favore militum anxius et superbia viri aequalium quoque , adeo superiorum intolerantis$$ Nor would he suffer Antonius Primus to be taken into the number of Domitian's attendants ,  for he felt uneasy at his popularity with the troops ,  and feared the proud spirit of the man ,  who could not endure an equal ,  much less a superior
 profectus ad Vespasianum Antonius ut non pro spe sua excipitur , ita neque averso imperatoris animo$$ Antonius then went to Vespasian ,  who received him ,  not indeed as he expected ,  but in a not unfriendly spirit
 trahebatur in diversa , hinc meritis Antonii , cuius ductu confectum haud dubie bellum erat , inde Muciani epistulis$$ Two opposite influences acted on the Emperor on the one hand were the merits of Antonius ,  under whose conduct the war had beyond all doubt been terminated
 simul ceteri ut infestum tumidumque insectabantur , adiunctis prioris vitae criminibus$$ on the other ,  were the letters of Mucianus And everyone else inveighed against him ,  as an ill-affected and conceited man ,  nor did they forget the scandals of his early life

 precabaturque principem ut genas et oculorum orbis dignaretur respergere oris excremento$$ He begged Vespasian that he would deign to moisten his cheeks and eye-balls with his spittle

 illi elapsos in pravum artus , si salubris vis adhibeatur , posse integrari$$ in the other case ,  the limb ,  which had fallen into a diseased condition ,  might be restored ,  if a healing influence were applied
 id fortasse cordi deis et divino ministerio principem electum$$ such ,  perhaps ,  might be the pleasure of the Gods ,  and the Emperor might be chosen to be the minister of the divine will
 denique patrati remedii gloriam penes Caesarem , inriti ludibrium penes miseros fore$$ at any rate ,  all the glory of a successful remedy would be Caesar's ,  while the ridicule of failure would fall on the sufferers
 igitur Vespasianus cuncta fortunae suae patere ratus nec quicquam ultra incredibile , laeto ipse vultu , erecta quae adstabat multitudine , iussa exequitur$$ And so Vespasian ,  supposing that all things were possible to his good fortune ,  and that nothing was any longer past belief ,  with a joyful countenance ,  amid the intense expectation of the multitude of bystanders ,  accomplished what was required

 Timotheus quaesitis qui in Pontum meassent , cognoscit urbem illic Sinopen , nec procul templum vetere inter accolas fama Iovis Ditis namque et muliebrem effigiem adsistere quam plerique Proserpinam vocent$$ Timotheus ,  questioning persons who had found their way to Pontus ,  learnt that there was there a city Sinope ,  and near it a temple ,  which ,  according to an old tradition of the neighbourhood ,  was sacred to the infernal Jupiter ,  for there also stood close at hand a female figure ,  to which many gave the name of Proserpine
 sed Ptolemaeus , ut sunt ingenia regum , pronus ad formidinem , ubi securitas rediit , voluptatum quam religionum adpetens neglegere paulatim aliasque ad curas animum vertere , donec eadem species terribilior iam et instantior exitium ipsi regnoque denuntiaret ni iussa patrarentur$$ Ptolemy ,  however ,  with the true disposition of a despot ,  though prone to alarm ,  was ,  when the feeling of security returned ,  more intent on pleasures than on religious matters and he began by degrees to neglect the affair ,  and to turn his thoughts to other concerns ,  till at length the same apparition ,  but now more terrible and peremptory ,  denounced ruin against the king and his realm ,  unless his bidding were performed

 Tantumque belli superfuit ut praesidia cohortium alarum legionum uno die Civilis quadripertito invaserit , decimam legionem Arenaci , secundam Batavoduri et Grinnes Vadamque , cohortium alarumque castra , ita divisis copiis ut ipse et Verax , sorore eius genitus , Classicusque ac Tutor suam quisque manum traherent , nec omnia patrandi fiducia , sed multa ausis aliqua in parte fortunam adfore$$ The war was so far from being at an end ,  that Civilis in one day attacked on four points the positions of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry and of the legions ,  assailing the tenth legion at Arenacum ,  the second at Batavodurum ,  and the camp of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry at Grinnes and Vada ,  and so dividing his forces ,  that he himself ,  his sister's son Verax ,  Classicus ,  and Tutor ,  led each his own division They were not confident of accomplishing all these objects ,  but they hoped that ,  if they made many ventures ,  fortune would favour them on some one point
 simul Cerialem neque satis cautum et pluribus nuntiis huc illuc cursantem posse medio intercipi$$ Besides ,  Cerialis was not cautious ,  and might easily be intercepted ,  as the multiplicity of tidings hurried him from place to place
 Quibus obvenerant castra decimanorum , obpugnationem legionis arduam rati egressum militem et caedendis materiis operatum turbavere , occiso praefecto castrorum et quinque primoribus centurionum paucisque militibus$$ The force ,  which had to attack the tenth legion ,  thinking it a hard matter to storm a legionary encampment ,  surprised some troops ,  who had gone out ,  and were busy felling timber ,  killed the prefect of the camp ,  five centurions of the first rank ,  and a few soldiers
 ceteri se munimentis defendere$$ the rest found shelter behind the fortifications
 Interim Germanorum manus Batavoduri interrumpere inchoatum pontem nitebantur$$ At Batavodurum the German troops tried to break down the bridge partly built
 ambiguum proelium nox diremit$$ Night terminated an indecisive conflict
 Plus discriminis apud Grinnes Vadamque$$ There was greater danger at Grinnes and Vada
 Vadam Civilis , Grinnes Classicus obpugnabant nec sisti poterant interfecto fortissimo quoque , in quis Briganticus praefectus alae ceciderat , quem fidum Romanis et Civili avunculo infensum diximus$$ Civilis attacked Vada ,  Classicus Grinnes ,  and they could not be checked ,  for our bravest men had fallen ,  among them Briganticus ,  who commanded a squadron of cavalry ,  and of whose loyalty to the Roman cause and enmity to his uncle Civilis I have already spoken
 Sed ubi Cerialis cum delecta equitum manu subvenit , versa fortuna$$ But when Cerialis came up with a picked body of cavalry ,  the fortune of the day changed ,  and the Germans were driven headlong into the river
 praecipites Germani in amnem aguntur Civilis dum fugientis retentat , agnitus petitusque telis relicto equo transnatavit$$ Civilis ,  who was recognised while seeking to stop his flying troops ,  became the mark of many missiles ,  left his horse ,  and swam across the river
 idem Veraci effugium$$ Verax escaped in the same way
 Tutorem Classicumque adpulsae luntres vexere$$ Some light vessels were brought up ,  and carried off Tutor and Classicus
 Ne tum quidem Romana classis pugnae adfuit , et iussum erat , sed obstitit formido et remiges per alia militiae munia dispersi$$ Even on this occasion the Roman fleet was not present at the engagement ,  though orders had been given to that effect
 Sane Cerialis parum temporis ad exequenda imperia dabat , subitus consiliis set eventu clarus$$ Fear kept them away ,  and their crews were dispersed about other military duties
 aderat fortuna , etiam ubi artes defuissent$$ Cerialis in fact allowed too little time for executing his commands
 hinc ipsi exercituique minor cura disciplinae$$ he was hasty in his plans ,  though eminently successful in their results
 Et paucos post dies , quamquam periculum captivitatis evasisset , infamiam non vitavit$$ Fortune helped him even where skill had failed ,  and so both the general and his army became less careful about discipline
 Civilem cupido incessit navalem aciem ostentandi$$ Civilis was seized by a desire to make a naval demonstration
 complet quod biremium quaeque simplici ordine agebantur$$ He manned all the triremes that he had ,  and such vessels as were propelled by a single bank of oars
 adiecta ingens luntrium vis , tricenos quadragenosque ferunt , armamenta Liburnicis solita$$ To these he added a vast number of boats He put in each three or four hundred men ,  the usual complement of a Liburnian galley
 et simul captae luntres sagulis versicoloribus haud indecore pro velis iuvabantur$$ With these were the captured vessels ,  in which ,  picturesquely enough ,  plaids of various colours were used for sails
 Spatium velut aequoris electum quo Mosae fluminis os amnem Rhenum Oceano adfundit$$ The place selected was an expanse of water ,  not unlike the sea ,  where the mouth of the Mosa serves to discharge the Rhine into the ocean
 Causa instruendae classis super insitam genti vanitatem ut eo terrore commeatus Gallia adventantes interciperentur$$ The motive for equipping this fleet was ,  to say nothing of the natural vanity of this people ,  a desire to intercept ,  by this alarming demonstration ,  the supplies that were approaching from Gaul
 Cerialis miraculo magis quam metu derexit classem , numero imparem , usu remigum , gubernatorum arte , navium magnitudine potiorem$$ Cerialis ,  more in astonishment than alarm ,  drew up his fleet in line ,  and ,  though inferior in numbers ,  it had the advantage in the experience of the crews ,  the skill of the pilots ,  and the size of the vessels
 His flumen secundum , illi vento agebantur$$ The Romans had the stream with them ,  the enemy's vessels were propelled by the wind
 sic praevecti temptato levium telorum iactu dirimuntur$$ Thus passing each other ,  they separated after a brief discharge of light missiles
 Civilis nihil ultra ausus trans Rhenum concessit$$ Civilis attempted nothing more ,  and retired to the other side of the Rhine
 Cerialis insulam Batavorum hostiliter populatus agros villasque Civilis intactas nota arte ducum sinebat , cum interim flexu autumni et crebris per aequinoctium imbribus superfusus amnis palustrem humilemque insulam in faciem stagni opplevit$$ Cerialis mercilessly ravaged the Island of the Batavi ,  but ,  with a policy familiar to commanders ,  left untouched the estates and houses of Civilis Meanwhile ,  however ,  the autumn was far advanced ,  and the river ,  swollen by the continual rains of the season ,  overflowed the island ,  marshy and low-lying as it is ,  till it resembled a lake
 Nec classis aut commeatus aderant , castraque in plano sita vi fluminis differebantur$$ There were no ships ,  no provisions at hand ,  and the camp ,  which was situated on low ground ,  was in process of being carried away by the force of the stream
 Potuisse tunc opprimi legiones et voluisse Germanos , sed dolo a se flexos imputavit Civilis$$ That the legions might then have been crushed ,  and that the Germans wished to crush them ,  but were turned from their purpose by his own craft ,  was claimed as a merit by Civilis
 neque abhorret vero , quando paucis post diebus deditio insecuta est$$ nor is it unlike the truth ,  since a capitulation followed in a few days
 Nam Cerialis per occultos nuntios Batavis pacem , Civili veniam ostentans , Veledam propinquosque monebat fortunam belli , tot cladibus adversam , opportuno erga populum Romanum merito mutare$$ Cerialis ,  sending secret emissaries ,  had held out the prospect of peace to the Batavi ,  and of pardon to Civilis ,  while he advised Veleda and her relatives to change by a well-timed service to the Roman people the fortune of war ,  which so many disasters had shewn to be adverse
 caesos Treviros , receptos Vbios , ereptam Batavis patriam neque aliud Civilis amicitia partum quam vulnera fugas luctus$$ He reminded them that the Treveri had been beaten ,  that the Ubii had submitted ,  that the Batavi had had their country taken from them ,  and that from the friendship of Civilis nothing else had been gained but wounds ,  defeat ,  and mourning
 Exulem eum et extorrem recipientibus oneri , et satis peccavisse quod totiens Rhenum transcenderint$$ an exile and a fugitive he could only be a burden to those who entertained him ,  and they had already trespassed enough in crossing the Rhine so often
 Si quid ultra moliantur , inde iniuriam et culpam , hinc ultionem et deos fore$$ If they attempted anything more ,  on their side would be the wrong and the guilt ,  with the Romans the vengeance of heaven
 Non fefellit Civilem ea inclinatio et praevenire statuit , super taedium malorum etiam spe vitae , quae plerumque magnos animos infringit$$ These dispositions did not escape the notice of Civilis He determined to anticipate them ,  moved not only by weariness of his sufferings ,  but also by that clinging to life which often breaks the noblest spirits
 Petito conloquio scinditur Nabaliae fluminis pons , in cuius abrupta progressi duces , et Civilis ita coepit$$ He asked for a conference The bridge over the river Nabalia was cut down ,  and the two generals advanced to the broken extremities
 si apud Vitellii legatum defenderer , neque facto meo venia neque dictis fides debebatur$$ Civilis thus opened the conference  If it were before a legate of Vitellius that I were defending myself ,  my acts would deserve no pardon ,  my words no credit
 cuncta inter nos inimica hostilia ab illo coepta , a me aucta erant$$ All the relations between us were those of hatred and hostility ,  first made so by him ,  and afterwards embittered by me
 erga Vespasianum vetus mihi observantia , et cum privatus esset , amici vocabamur$$ My respect for Vespasian is of long standing While he was still a subject ,  we were called friends
 Hoc Primo Antonio notum , cuius epistulis ad bellum actus sum , ne Germanicae legiones et Gallica iuventus Alpis transcenderent$$ This was known to Primus Antonius ,  whose letters urged me to take up arms ,  for he feared lest the legions of Germany and the youth of Gaul should cross the Alps
 Quae Antonius epistulis , Hordeonius Flaccus praesens monebat$$ What Antonius advised by his letters ,  Hordeonius suggested by word of mouth
 arma in Germania movi , quae Mucianus in Syria , Aponius in Moesia , Flavianus in Pannonia$$ I fought the same battle in Germany ,  as did Mucianus in Syria ,  Aponius in Moesia ,  Flavianus in Pannonia
 Germania omnis a Gallis Rhaetisque et Pannoniis Rheno et Danubio fluminibus , a Sarmatis Dacisque mutuo metu aut montibus separatur$$ Germany is separated from the Galli ,  the Rhæti ,  and Pannonii ,  by the rivers Rhine and Danube mountain ranges ,  or the fear which each feels for the other ,  divide it from the Sarmatæ and Daci
 cetera Oceanus ambit , latos sinus et insularum immensa spatia complectens , nuper cognitis quibusdam gentibus ac regibus , quos bellum aperuit$$ Elsewhere ocean girds it ,  embracing broad peninsulas and islands of unexplored extent ,  where certain tribes and kingdoms are newly known to us ,  revealed by war
 Rhenus , Rhaeticarum Alpium inaccesso ac praecipiti vertice ortus , modico flexu in occidentem versus , septentrionali Oceano miscetur$$ The Rhine springs from a precipitous and inaccessible height of the Rhætian Alps ,  bends slightly westward ,  and mingles with the Northern Ocean
 Danubius , molli et clementer edito montis Abnobae jugo effusus , plures populos adit , donec in Ponticum mare sex meatibus erumpat$$ The Danube pours down from the gradual and gently rising slope of Mount Abnoba ,  and visits many nations ,  to force its way at last through six channels into the Pontus
 septimum os paludibus hauritur$$ a seventh mouth is lost in marshes
 Ipsos Germanos indigenas crediderim , minimeque aliarum gentium adventibus et hospitiis mixtos$$ The Germans themselves I should regard as aboriginal ,  and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse
 quia nec terra olim , sed classibus advehebantur , qui mutare sedes quaerebant , et immensus ultra , utque sic dixerim , adversus Oceanus raris ab orbe nostro navibus aditur$$ For ,  in former times ,  it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive and the boundless and ,  so to speak ,  hostile ocean beyond us ,  is seldom entered by a sail from our world
 Quis porro , praeter periculum horridi et ignoti maris , Asia aut Africa aut Italia relicta , Germaniam peteret , informem terris , asperam coelo , tristem cultu aspectuque , nisi si patria sit$$ And ,  beside the perils of rough and unknown seas ,  who would leave Asia ,  or Africa ,  or Italy for Germany ,  with its wild country ,  its inclement skies ,  its sullen manners and aspect ,  unless indeed it were his home
 Celebrant carminibus antiquis (quod unum apud illos memoriae et annalium genus est) Tuisconem deum terra editum , et filium Mannum , originem gentis conditoresque$$ In their ancient songs ,  their only way of remembering or recording the past ,  they celebrate an earth-born god ,  Tuisco ,  and his son Mannus ,  as the origin of their race ,  as their founders
 Manno tres filios assignant , e quorum nominibus proximi Oceano Ingaevones , medii Hermiones , ceteri Istaevones vocentur$$ To Mannus they assign three sons ,  from whose names ,  they say ,  the coast tribes are called Ingævones
 Quidam autem , ut in licentia vetustatis , plures deo ortos pluresque gentis appellationes , Marsos , Gambrivios , Suevos , Vandalios , affirmant eaque vera et antiqua nomina$$ those of the interior ,  Herminones all the rest ,  Istævones Some ,  with the freedom of conjecture permitted by antiquity ,  assert that the god had several descendants ,  and the nation several appellations ,  as Marsi ,  Gambrivii ,  Suevi ,  Vandilii ,  and that these are genuine old names
 Ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum quoniam , qui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint , ac nunc Tungri , tunc Germani vocati sint$$ The name Germany ,  on the other hand ,  they say ,  is modern and newly introduced ,  from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the Rhine and drove out the Gauls ,  and are now called Tungrians ,  were then called Germans
 ita nationis nomen , non gentis evaluisse paulatim , ut omnes primum a victore ob metum , mox a seipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur$$ Thus what was the name of a tribe ,  and not of a race ,  gradually prevailed ,  till all called themselves by this self-invented name of Germans ,  which the conquerors had first employed to inspire terror
 Fuisse apud eos et Herculem memorant , primumque omnium virorum fortium ituri in proelia canunt$$ They say that Hercules ,  too ,  once visited them and when going into battle ,  they sing of him first of all heroes
 Sunt illis haec quoque carmina , quorum relatu , quem baritum vocant , accendunt animos , futuraeque pugnae fortunam ipso cantu augurantur$$ They have also those songs of theirs ,  by the recital of which (baritus ,  they call it) ,  they rouse their courage ,  while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict
 terrent enim trepidantve , prout sonuit acies$$ For ,  as their line shouts ,  they inspire or feel alarm
 Nec tam voces illae , quam virtutis concentus videntur$$ It is not so much an articulate sound ,  as a general cry of valour
 Affectatur praecipue asperitas soni et fractum murmur , objectis ad os scutis , quo plenior et gravior vox repercussu intumescat$$ They aim chiefly at a harsh note and a confused roar ,  putting their shields to their mouth ,  so that ,  by reverberation ,  it may swell into a fuller and deeper sound
 Ceterum et Ulixem quidam opinantur longo illo et fabuloso errore in hunc Occanum delatum , adisse Germaniae terras , Asciburgiumque , quod in ripa Rheni situm hodieque incolitur , ab illo constitutum nominatumque$$ Ulysses ,  too ,  is believed by some ,  in his long legendary wanderings ,  to have found his way into this ocean ,  and ,  having visited German soil ,  to have founded and named the town of Asciburgium ,  which stands on the bank of the Rhine ,  and is to this day inhabited
 Aram quin etiam Ulixi consecratam , adjecto Laertae patris nomine , eodem loco olim repertam , monumentaque et tumulos quosdam Graecis litteris inscriptos in confinio Germaniae Rhaetiaeque adhuc exstare$$ They even say that an altar dedicated to Ulysses ,  with the addition of the name of his father ,  Laertes ,  was formerly discovered on this same spot ,  and that certain monuments and tombs ,  with Greek inscriptions ,  still exist on the borders of Germany and Rhætia
 quae neque confirmare argumentis , neque refellere in animo est$$ These statements I have no intention of sustaining by proofs ,  or of refuting
 ex ingenio suo quisque demat , vel addat fidem$$ every one may believe or disbelieve them as he feels inclined
 Ipse eorum opinionibus accedo , qui Germaniae populos nullis aliis aliarum nationum connubiis infectos propriam et sinceram et tantum sui similem gentem exstitisse arbitrantur$$ For my own part ,  I agree with those who think that the tribes of Germany are free from all taint of intermarriages with foreign nations ,  and that they appear as a distinct ,  unmixed race ,  like none but themselves
 unde habitus quoque corporum , quanquam in tanto hominum numero , idem omnibus$$ Hence ,  too ,  the same physical peculiarities throughout so vast a population
 truces et cacrulei oculi , rutilae comae , magna corpora et tantum ad impetum valida$$ All have fierce blue eyes ,  red hair ,  huge frames ,  fit only for a sudden exertion
 laboris atque operum non eadem patientia$$ They are less able to bear laborious work

 Terra , etsi aliquanto specie differt , in universum tamen aut silvis horrida aut paludibus foeda$$ Their country ,  though somewhat various in appearance yet generally either bristles with forests or reeks with swamps
 humidior , qua Gallias$$ it is more rainy on the side of Gaul ,  bleaker on that of Noricum and Pannonia
 ventosior , qua Noricum ac Pannoniam aspicit$$ It is productive of grain ,  but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees
 satis ferax frugiferarum arborum impatiens pecorum fecunda , sed plerumque improcera$$ it is rich in flocks and herds ,  but these are for the most part undersized ,  and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head
 ne armentis quidem suus honor , aut gloria frontis$$ It is number that is chiefly valued
 numero gaudent$$ they are in fact the most highly prized ,  indeed the only riches of the people
 eaeque solae et gratissimae opes sunt$$ Silver and gold the gods have refused to them ,  whether in kindness or in anger I cannot say
 Argentum et aurum propitii an irati dii aegaverint , dubito$$ I would not ,  however ,  affirm that no vein of German soil produces gold or silver ,  for who has ever made a search
 Nec tamen affirmaverim , nullam Germaniae venam argentum aurumve gignere$$ They care but little to possess or use them
 quis enim scrutatus est possessione et usu haud perinde afficiuntur$$ You may see among them vessels of silver ,  which have been presented to their envoys and chieftains ,  held as cheap as those of clay
 Est videre apud illos argentea vasa , legatis et principibus eorum muneri data , non in alia vilitate , quam quae humo finguntur quanquam proximi , ob usum commerciorum , aurum et argentum in pretio habent , formasque quasdam nostrae pecuniae agnoscunt atque eligunt$$ The border population ,  however ,  value gold and silver for their commercial utility ,  and are familiar with ,  and show preference for ,  some of our coins The tribes of the interior use the simpler and more ancient practice of the barter of commodities They like the old and well-known money ,  coins milled ,  or showing a two-horse chariot
 interiores simplicius et antiquius permutatione mercium utuntur Pecuniam probant veterem et diu notam , serratos bigatosque$$ They likewise prefer silver to gold ,  not from any special liking ,  but because a large number of silver pieces is more convenient for use among dealers in cheap and common articles
 Ne ferrum quidem superest , sicut ex genere telorum colligitur$$ Even iron is not plentiful with them ,  as we infer from the character of their weapons
 Rari gladiis aut majoribus lanceis utuntur$$ But few use swords or long lances
 hastas , vel ipsorum vocabulo frameas gerunt , angusto et brevi ferro sed ita acri et ad usum habili , ut eodem telo , prout ratio poscit , vel cominus vel eminus pugnent$$ They carry a spear (framea is their name for it) ,  with a narrow and short head ,  but so sharp and easy to wield that the same weapon serves ,  according to circumstances ,  for close or distant conflict
 et eques quidem scuto frameaque contentus est$$ As for the horse-soldier ,  he is satisfied with a shield and spear
 pedites et missilia spargunt , plura singuli , atque in immensum vibrant , nudi aut sagulo leves$$ the foot-soldiers also scatter showers of missiles ,  each man having several and hurling them to an immense distance ,  and being naked or lightly clad with a little cloak
 Nulla cultus jactatio$$ There is no display about their equipment 
 scuta tantum lectissimis coloribus distinguunt$$  their shields alone are marked with very choice colours
 paucis loricae$$ A few only have corslets ,  and just one or two here and there a metal or leathern helmet
 vix uni alterive cassis aut galea$$ Their horses are remarkable neither for beauty nor for fleetness
 Equi non forma , non velocitate conspicui sed nec variare gyros in morem nostrum docentur$$ Nor are they taught various evolutions after our fashion ,  but are driven straight forward ,  or so as to make one wheel to the right in such a compact body that none is left behind another
 In rectum , aut uno flexu dextros agunt ita conjuncto orbe , ut nemo posterior sit$$ On the whole ,  one would say that their chief strength is in their infantry ,  which fights along with the cavalry
 In universum aestimanti , plus penes peditem roboris eoque mixti proeliantur , apta et congruente ad equestrem pugnam velocitate peditum , quos ex omni juventute delectos ante aciem locant$$ admirably adapted to the action of the latter is the swiftness of certain foot-soldiers ,  who are picked from the entire youth of their country ,  and stationed in front of the line
 Definitur et numerus$$ Their number is fixed ,  a hundred from each canton
 centeni ex singulis pagis sunt$$ and from this they take their name among their countrymen ,  so that what was originally a mere number has now become a title of distinction
 idque ipsum inter suos vocantur$$ Their line of battle is drawn up in a wedge-like formation
 et quod primo numerus fuit , jam nomen et honor est$$ To give ground ,  provided you return to the attack ,  is considered prudence rather than cowardice
 Acies per cuneos componitur$$ The bodies of their slain they carry off even in indecisive engagements
 Cedere loco , dummodo rursus instes , consilii quam formidinis arbitrantur$$ To abandon your shield is the basest of crimes
 Corpora suorum etiam in dubiis proeliis referunt$$ nor may a man thus disgraced be present at the sacred rites ,  or enter their council
 Scutum reliquisse , praecipuum flagitium$$ many ,  indeed ,  after escaping from battle ,  have ended their infamy with the halter
 Reges ex nobilitate , duces ex virtute sumunt$$ They choose their kings by birth ,  their generals for merit
 Nec regibus infinita aut libera potestas$$ These kings have not unlimited or arbitrary power ,  and the generals do more by example than by authority
 et duces exemplo potius , quam imperio , si prompti , si conspicui , si ante aciem agant , admiratione praesunt$$ If they are energetic ,  if they are conspicuous ,  if they fight in the front ,  they lead because they are admired
 Ceterum neque animadvertere neque vincire , ne verberare quidem , nisi sacerdotibus permissum non quasi in poenam , nec ducis jussu , sed velut deo imperante , quem adesse bellantibus credunt$$ But to reprimand ,  to imprison ,  even to flog ,  is permitted to the priests alone ,  and that not as a punishment ,  or at the general's bidding ,  but ,  as it were ,  by the mandate of the god whom they believe to inspire the warrior
 effigiesque et signa quaedam , detracta lucis , in proelium ferunt$$ They also carry with them into battle certain figures and images taken from their sacred groves
 Quodque praecipuum fortitudinis incitamentum est , non casus nec fortuita conglobatio turmam aut cuneum facit , sed familiae et propinquitates , et in proximo pignora , unde feminarum ululatus audiri , unde vagitus infantium$$ And what most stimulates their courage is ,  that their squadrons or battalions ,  instead of being formed by chance or by a fortuitous gathering ,  are composed of families and clans Close by them ,  too ,  are those dearest to them ,  so that they hear the shrieks of women ,  the cries of infants
 hi cuique sanctissimi testes , hi maximi laudatores$$ They are to every man the most sacred witnesses of his bravery they are his most generous applauders
 Ad matres , ad conjuges vulnera ferunt nec illae numerare , aut exigere plagas pavent$$ The soldier brings his wounds to mother and wife ,  who shrink not from counting or even demanding them and who administer both food and encouragement to the combatants
 Memoriae proditur , quasdam acies , inclinatas jam et labantes , a feminis restitutas , constantia precum et objectu pectorum et monstrata cominus captivitate , quam longe impatientius feminarum suarum nomine timent adeo ut efficacius obligentur animi civitatum , quibus inter obsides puellae quoque nobiles imperantur$$ Tradition says that armies already wavering and giving way have been rallied by women who ,  with earnest entreaties and bosoms laid bare ,  have vividly represented the horrors of captivity ,  which the Germans fear with such extreme dread on behalf of their women ,  that the strongest tie by which a state can be bound is the being required to give ,  among the number of hostages ,  maidens of noble birth
 Inesse quin etiam sanctum aliquid et providum putant nec aut consilia earum aspernantur , aut responsa negligunt$$ They even believe that the sex has a certain sanctity and prescience ,  and they do not despise their counsels ,  or make light of their answers
 Vidimus sub divo Vespasiano Veledam diu apud plerosque numinis loco habitam$$ In Vespasian's days we saw Veleda ,  long regarded by many as a divinity
 Sed et olim Auriniam et complures alias venerati sunt non adulatione , nec tanquam facerent deas$$ In former times ,  too ,  they venerated Aurinia ,  and many other women ,  but not with servile flatteries ,  or with sham deification
 De minoribus rebus principes consultant$$ About minor matters the chiefs deliberate ,  about the more important the whole tribe
 de majoribus omnes ita tamen , ut ea quoque , quorum penes plebem arbitrium est , apud principes pertractentur$$ Yet even when the final decision rests with the people ,  the affair is always thoroughly discussed by the chiefs
 Coeunt , nisi quid fortuitum et subitum inciderit , certis diebus , cum aut inchoatur luna aut impletur$$ They assemble ,  except in the case of a sudden emergency ,  on certain fixed days ,  either at new or at full moon
 nam agendis rebus hoc auspicatissimum initium credunt$$ for this they consider the most auspicious season for the transaction of business
 Nec dierum numerum , ut nos , sed noctium computant Sic constituunt , sic condicunt$$ Instead of reckoning by days as we do ,  they reckon by nights ,  and in this manner fix both their ordinary and their legal appointments
 nox ducere diem videtur$$ Night they regard as bringing on day
 Illud ex libertate vitium , quod non simul , nec ut jussi conveniunt , sed et alter et tertius dies cunctatione coeuntium absumitur$$ Their freedom has this disadvantage ,  that they do not meet simultaneously or as they are bidden ,  but two or three days are wasted in the delays of assembling
 Ut turbae placuit , considunt armati$$ When the multitude think proper ,  they it down armed
 Silentium per sacerdotes , quibus tum et coercendi jus est , imperatur$$ Silence is proclaimed by the priests ,  who have on these occasions the right of keeping order
 Mox rex vel princeps , prout aetas cuique , prout nobilitas , prout decus bellorum , prout facundia est , audiuntur , auctoritate suadendi magis , quam jubendi potestate$$ Then the king or the chief ,  according to age ,  birth ,  distinction in war ,  or eloquence ,  is heard ,  more because he has influence to persuade than because he has power to command

 Diversitas supplicii illuc respicit , tanquam scelera ostendi oporteat , dum puniuntur , flagitia abscondi$$ This distinction in punishment means that crime ,  they think ,  ought ,  in being punished ,  to be exposed ,  while infamy ought to be buried out of sight
 Sed et levioribus delictis , pro modo poenarum , equorum pecorumque numero convicti mulctantur$$ Lighter offences ,  too ,  have penalties proportioned to them he who is convicted ,  is fined in a certain number of horses or of cattle
 pars mulctae regi vel civitati , pars ipsi , qui vindicatur , vel propinquis ejus exsolvitur$$ Half of the fine is paid to the king or to the state ,  half to the person whose wrongs are avenged and to his relatives

 Gradus quin etiam et ipse comitatus habet judicio ejus , quem sectantur$$ Even in his escort there are gradations of rank ,  dependent on the choice of the man to whom they are attached

 Nec solum in sua gente cuique , sed apud finitimas quoque civitates id nomen , ea gloria est , si numero ac virtute comitatus emineat$$ it is an ornament in peace and a defence in war And not only in his own tribe but also in the neighbouring states it is the renown and glory of a chief to be distinguished for
 expetuntur enim legationibus et muneribus ornantur et ipsa plerumque fama bella profligant$$ the number and valour of his followers ,  for such a man is courted by embassies ,  is honoured with presents ,  and the very prestige of his name often settles a war
 Cum ventum in aciem , turpe principi virtute vinci , turpe comitatui , virtutem principis non adaequare$$ When they go into battle ,  it is a disgrace for the chief to be surpassed in valour ,  a disgrace for his followers not to equal the valour of the chief

 Quotiens bella non ineunt , non multum venatibus , plus per otium transigunt , dediti somno ciboque , fortissimus quisque ac bellicosissimus nihil agens , delegata domus et penatium et agrorum cura feminis senibusque et infirmissimo cuique ex familia$$ Whenever they are not fighting ,  they pass much of their time in the chase ,  and still more in idleness ,  giving themselves up to sleep and to feasting ,  the bravest and the most warlike doing nothing ,  and surrendering the management of the household ,  of the home ,  and of the land ,  to the women ,  the old men ,  and all the weakest members of the family
 ipsi hebent mira diversitate naturae , cum iidem homines sic ament inertiam et oderint quietem$$ They themselves lie buried in sloth ,  a strange combination in their nature that the same men should be so fond of idleness ,  so averse to peace
 Mos est civitatibus ultro ac viritim conferre principibus vel armentorum vel frugum , quod pro honore acceptum , etiam necessitatibus subvenit$$ It is the custom of the states to bestow by voluntary and individual contribution on the chiefs a present of cattle or of grain ,  which ,  while accepted as a compliment ,  supplies their wants

 Ne caementorum quidem apud illos aut tegularum usus$$ they employ timber for all purposes ,  rude masses without ornament or attractiveness

 Tegumen omnibus sagum , fibula , aut , si desit , spina consertum cetera intecti totos dies juxta focum atque ignem agunt$$ They all wrap themselves in a cloak which is fastened with a clasp ,  or ,  if this is not forthcoming ,  with a thorn ,  leaving the rest of their persons bare

 durant siquidem colles , paulatim rarescunt , et Chattos suos saltus Hercynius prosequitur simul atque deponit$$ They are found where there are hills ,  and with them grow less frequent ,  for the Hercynian forest keeps close till it has seen the last of its native Chatti

 Tencteri , super solitum bellorum decus , equestris disciplinae arte praecellunt nec major apud Chattos peditum laus , quam Tencteris equitum$$ The latter ,  besides the more usual military distinctions ,  particularly excel in the organisation of cavalry ,  and the Chatti are not more famous for their foot-soldiers than are the Tencteri for their horsemen

 Ipsum quin etiam Oceanum illa tentavimus$$ We have even ventured on the ocean itself in these parts
 et superesse adhuc Herculis columnas fama vulgavit$$ Pillars of Hercules ,  so rumour commonly says ,  still exist
 sive adiit Hercules , seu , quicquid ubique magnificum est , in claritatem ejus referre consensimus$$ whether Hercules really visited the country ,  or whether we have agreed to ascribe every work of grandeur ,  wherever met with ,  to his renown
 Nec defuit audentia Druso Germanico$$ Drusus Germanicus indeed did not lack daring

 idque jucundius , quam tutius , fuit quia inter impotentes et validos falso quiescas$$ This was more pleasant than safe ,  for to be peaceful is self-deception among lawless and powerful neighbours
 ubi manu agitur , modestia ac probitas nomina superioris sunt$$ Where the strong hand decides ,  moderation and justice are terms applied only to the more powerful
 Ita , qui olim boni aequique Cherusci , nunc inertes ac stulti vocantur Chattis victoribus fortuna in sapientiam cessit$$ and so the Cherusci ,  ever reputed good and just ,  are now called cowards and fools ,  while in the case of the victorious Chatti success has been identified with prudence
 Tracti ruina Cheruscorum et Fosi , contermina gens , adversarum rerum ex aequo socii , cum in secundis minores fuissent$$ The downfall of the Cherusci brought with it also that of the Fosi ,  a neighbouring tribe ,  which shared equally in their disasters ,  though they had been inferior to them in prosperous days
 Eundem Germaniae sinum proximi Oceano Cimbri tenent , parva nunc civitas , sed gloria ingens$$ In the same remote corner of Germany ,  bordering on the ocean dwell the Cimbri ,  a now insignificant tribe ,  but of great renown
 veterisque famae lata vestigia manent , utraque ripa castra ac spatia , quorum ambitu nunc quoque metiaris molem manusque gentis et tam magni exitus fidem$$ Of their ancient glory widespread traces yet remain on both sides of the Rhine are encampments of vast extent ,  and by their circuit you may even now measure the warlike strength of the tribe ,  and find evidence of that mighty emigration
 Sexcentesimum et quadragesimum annum urbs nostra agebat , cum primum Cimbrorum audita sunt arma , Caecilio Metello et Papirio Carbone consulibus$$ Rome was in her 640th year when we first heard of the Cimbrian invader in the consulship of Cæcilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo ,  from which time to the second consulship of the Emperor Trajan we have to reckon about 210 years
 Ex quo si ad alterum Imperatoris Trajani consulatum computemus , ducenti ferme et decem anni colliguntur$$ So long have we been in conquering Germany
 tamdiu Germania vincitur$$ In the space of this long epoch many losses have been sustained on both sides
 Medio tam longi aevi spatio , multa invicem damna$$ Neither Samnite nor Carthaginian ,  neither Spain nor Gaul ,  not even the Parthians ,  have given us more frequent warnings
 non Samnis , non Poeni , non Hispaniae Galliaeve , ne Parthi quidem saepius admonuere$$ German independence truly is fiercer than the despotism of an Arsaces
 quippe regno Arsacis acrior est Germanorum libertas$$ What else ,  indeed ,  can the East taunt us with but the slaughter of Crassus ,  when it has itself lost Pacorus ,  and been crushed under a Ventidius
 Quid enim aliud nobis , quam caedem Crassi , amisso et ipse Pacoro , infra Ventidium dejectus Oriens objecerit At Germani , Carbone et Cassio et Scauro Aurelio et Servilio Caepione , Marcus quoque Manlio fusis vel captis , quinque simul consulares exercitus Populo Romano , Varum , tresque cum eo legiones , etiam Caesari abstulerunt$$ But Germans ,  by routing or making prisoners of Carbo ,  Cassius ,  Scaurus Aurelius ,  Servilius Cæpio ,  and Marcus Manlius ,  deprived the Roman people of five consular armies ,  and they robbed even a Cæsar of Varus and his three legions Not without loss to us were they discomfited by Marius in Italy ,  by the great Julius in Gaul ,  and by Drusus ,  Nero ,  and Germanicus ,  on their own ground
 nec impune Gaius Marius in Italia , divus Julius in Gallia , Drusus ac Nero et Germanicus in suis eos sedibus perculerunt$$ Soon after ,  the mighty menaces of Caius Cæsar were turned into a jest
 Mox ingentes Gaius Caesaris minae in ludibrium versae Inde otium , donec occasione discordiae nostrae et civilium armorum , expugnatis legionum hibernis , etiam Gallias affectavere$$ Then came a lull ,  until on the occasion of our discords and the civil war ,  they stormed the winter camp of our legions ,  and even designed the conquest of Gaul
 ac rursus pulsi , inde proximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi sunt$$ Again were they driven back
 Nunc de Suevis dicendum est , quorum non una , ut Chattorum Tencterorumve , gens majorem enim Germaniae partem obtinent , propriis adhuc nationibus nominibusque discreti , quanquam in commune Suevi vocentur$$ I must now speak of the Suevi ,  who are not one nation as are the Chatti and Tencteri ,  for they occupy the greater part of Germany ,  and have hitherto been divided into separate tribes with names of their own ,  though they are called by the general designation of Suevi
 Insigne gentis obliquare crinem nodoque substringere sic Suevi a ceteris Germanis , sic Suevorum ingenui a servis separantur in aliis gentibus , seu cognatione aliqua Suevorum , seu quod saepe accidit , imitatione , rarum et intra juventae spatium$$ A national peculiarity with them is to twist their hair back ,  and fasten it in a knot This distinguishes the Suevi from the other Germans ,  as it also does their own freeborn from their slaves With other tribes ,  either from some connection with the Suevic race ,  or ,  as often happens ,  from imitation ,  the practice is an occasional one ,  and restricted to youth
 apud Suevos , usque ad canitiem , horrentem capillum retro sequuntur , ac saepe in ipso solo vertice religant$$ The Suevi ,  till their heads are grey ,  affect the fashion of drawing back their unkempt locks ,  and often they are knotted on the very top of the head
 Principes et ornatiorem habent$$ The chiefs have a more elaborate style
 ea cura formae , sed innoxiae neque enim ut ament amenturve$$ so much do they study appearance ,  but in perfect innocence ,  not with any thoughts of love-making
 in altitudinem quandam et terrorem , adituri bella , compti , ut hostium oculis , ornantur$$ but arranging their hair when they go to battle ,  to make themselves tall and terrible ,  they adorn themselves ,  so to speak ,  for the eyes of the foe
 Vetustissimos se nobilissimosque Suevorum Semnones memorant$$ The Semnones give themselves out to be the most ancient and renowned branch of the Suevi
 Fides antiquitatis religione firmatur$$ Their antiquity is strongly attested by their religion
 Stato tempore in silvam auguriis patrum et prisca formidine sacram , omnes ejusdem sanguinis populi legationibus coeunt , caesoque publice homine celebrant barbari ritus horrenda primordia$$ At a stated period ,  all the tribes of the same race assemble by their representatives in a grove consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers ,  and by immemorial associations of terror Here ,  having publicly slaughtered a human victim ,  they celebrate the horrible beginning of their barbarous rite
 Est et alia luco reverentia$$ Reverence also in other ways is paid to the grove
 Nemo nisi vinculo ligatus ingreditur , ut minor et potestatem numinis prae se ferens , Si forte prolapsus est , attolli et insurgere haud licitum$$ No one enters it except bound with a chain ,  as an inferior acknowledging the might of the local divinity If he chance to fall ,  it is not lawful for him to be lifted up ,  or to rise to his feet
 per humum evolvuntur$$ he must crawl out along the ground
 eoque omnis superstitio respicit , tanquam inde initia gentis , ibi regnator omnium deus , cetera subjecta atque parentia$$ All this superstition implies the belief that from this spot the nation took its origin ,  that here dwells the supreme and all-ruling deity ,  to whom all else is subject and obedient
 Adjicit auctoritatem fortuna Semnonum$$ The fortunate lot of the Semnones strengthens this belief
 centum pagis habitantur magnoque corpore efficitur , ut se Suevorum caput credant$$ a hundred cantons are in their occupation ,  and the vastness of their community makes them regard themselves as the head of the Suevic race
 Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat$$ To the Langobardi ,  on the contrary ,  their scanty numbers are a distinction
 plurimis ac valentissimis nationibus cincti , non per obsequium , sed proeliis et periclitando tuti sunt$$ Though surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes ,  they are safe ,  not by submitting ,  but by daring the perils of war
 Reudigni deinde et Aviones et Anglii et Varini et Eudoses et Suardones et Nuithones fluminibus aut silvis muniuntur$$ Next come the Reudigni ,  the Aviones ,  the Anglii ,  the Varini ,  the Eudoses ,  the Suardones ,  and Nuithones who are fenced in by rivers or forests
 nec quidquam notabile in singulis , nisi quod in commune Nerthum , id est Terram matrem colunt , eamque intervenire rebus hominum , invehi populis arbitrantur$$ None of these tribes have any noteworthy feature ,  except their common worship of Ertha ,  or mother-Earth ,  and their belief that she interposes in human affairs ,  and visits the nations in her car
 Est in insula Oceani castum nemus , dicatumque in eo vehiculum , veste contectum attingere uni sacerdoti concessum$$ In an island of the ocean there is a sacred grove ,  and within it a consecrated chariot ,  covered over with a garment
 Is adesse penetrali deam intelligit , vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur$$ Only one priest is permitted to touch it He can perceive the presence of the goddess in this sacred recess ,  and walks by her side with the utmost reverence as she is drawn along by heifers

 Non bella ineunt , non arma sumunt$$ They do not go to battle or wear arms
 clausum omne ferrum$$ every weapon is under lock
 pax et quies tunc tantum nota , tunc tantum amata , donec idem sacerdos satiatam conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat$$ peace and quiet are known and welcomed only at these times ,  till the goddess ,  weary of human intercourse ,  is at length restored by the same priest to her temple
 Mox vehiculum et vestes , et , si credere velis , numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur$$ Afterwards the car ,  the vestments ,  and ,  if you like to believe it ,  the divinity herself ,  are purified in a secret lake
 Servi ministrant , quos statim idem lacus haurit$$ Slaves perform the rite ,  who are instantly swallowed up by its waters
 arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia , quid sit illud , quod tantum perituri vident$$ Hence arises a mysterious terror and a pious ignorance concerning the nature of that which is seen only by men doomed to die
 Retro Marsigni , Gothini , Osi , Burii , terga Marcomannorum Quadorumque claudunt$$ Behind them the Marsigni ,  Gotini ,  Osi ,  and Buri ,  close in the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi
 e quibus Marsigni et Burii sermone cultuque Suevos referunt Gothinos Gallica , Osos Pannonica lingua coarguit non esse Germanos , et quod tributa patiuntur$$ Of these ,  the Marsigni and Buri ,  in their language and manner of life ,  resemble the Suevi The Gotini and Osi are proved by their respective Gallic and Pannonian tongues ,  as well as by the fact of their enduring tribute ,  not to be Germans

 ex quibus latissime patet Lygiorum nomen in plures civitates diffusum$$ The name of Ligii ,  spread as it is among many states ,  is the most widely extended
 Valentissimas nominasse sufficiet , Arios , Helveconas , Manimos , Elysios , Naharvalos$$ It will be enough to mention the most powerful ,  which are the Harii ,  the Helvecones ,  the Manimi ,  the Helisii and the Nahanarvali
 Apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur$$ Among these last is shown a grove of immemorial sanctity
 Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu$$ A priest in female attire has the charge of it
 sed deos , interpretatione Romana , Castorem Pollucemque memorant$$ But the deities are described in Roman language as Castor and Pollux
 ea vis numini$$ Such ,  indeed ,  are the attributes of the divinity ,  the name being Alcis
 nomen Alcis Nulla simulacra , nullum peregrinae superstitionis vestigium$$ They have no images ,  or ,  indeed ,  any vestige of foreign superstition ,  but it is as brothers and as youths that the deities are worshipped
 ut fratres tamen , ut juvenes , venerantur Ceterum Arii super vires , quibus enumeratos paulo ante populos antecedunt , truces , insitae feritati arte ac tempore lenocinantur$$ The Harii ,  besides being superior in strength to the tribes just enumerated ,  savage as they are ,  make the most of their natural ferocity by the help of art and opportunity
 Nigra scuta , tincta corpora$$ Their shields are black ,  their bodies dyed
 atras ad proelia noctes legunt ipsaque formidine atque umbra feralis exercitus terrorem inferant , nullo hostium sustinente novum ac velut infernum aspectum$$ They choose dark nights for battle ,  and ,  by the dread and gloomy aspect of their death-like host ,  strike terror into the foe ,  who can never confront their strange and almost infernal appearance
 nam primi in omnibus proeliis oculi vincuntur$$ For in all battles it is the eye which is first vanquished
 Trans Suionas aliud mare , pigrum ac prope immotum , quo cingi cludique terrarum orbem hinc fides , quod extremus cadentis jam solis fulgor in ortus edurat adeo clarus , ut sidera hebetet sonum insuper audiri , formasque deorum et radios capitis aspici persuasio adjicit Illuc usque , et fama vera , tantum natura Ergo jam dextro Suevici maris littore Aestyorum gentes alluuntur quibus ritus habitusque Suevorum lingua Britannicae propior Matrem deum venerantur insigne superstitionis , formas aprorum gestant id pro armis omnique tutela securum deae cultorem etiam inter hostes praestat Rarus ferri , frequens fustium usus Frumenta ceterosque fructus patientius , quam pro solita Germanorum inertia , laborant Sed et mare scrutantur , ac soli omnium succinum , quod ipsi glesum vocant inter vada atque in ipso littore legunt Nec , quae natura quaeve ratio gignat , ut barbaris , quaesitum compertumve Diu quin etiam inter cetera ejectamenta maris jacebat , donec luxuria nostra dedit nomen$$ Beyond the Suiones is another sea ,  sluggish and almost motionless ,  which ,  we may certainly infer ,  girdles and surrounds the world ,  from the fact that the last radiance of the setting sun lingers on till sunrise ,  with a brightness sufficient to dim the light of the stars
 ipsis in nullo usu rude legitur , informe perfertur , pretiumque mirantes accipiunt Succum tamen arborum esse intelligas , quia terrena quaedam atque etiam volucria animalia plerumque interlucent , quae implicata humore , mox , durescente materia , cluduntur Fecundiora igitur nemora lucosque , sicut Orientis secretis , ubi thura balsamaque sudantur , ita Occidentis insulis terrisque inesse , crediderim quae vicini solis radiis expressa atque liquentia in proximum mare labuntur , ac vi tempestatum in adversa littora exundant$$ Even the very sound of his rising ,  as popular belief adds ,  may be heard ,  and the forms of gods and the glory round his head may be seen

 Peucinorum Vene dorumque et Fennorum nationes Germanis an Sarmatis ascribam , dubito quanquam Peucini , quos quidam Bastarnas vocant , sermone , cultu , sede ac domiciliis , ut Germani , agunt$$ As to the tribes of the Peucini ,  Veneti ,  and Fenni ,  I am in doubt whether I should class them with the Germans or the Sarmatæ ,  although indeed the Peucini called by some Bastarnæ ,  are like Germans in their language ,  mode of life ,  and in the permanence of their settlements
 Sordes omnium ac torpor procerum connubiis mixtis , nonnihil in Sarmatarum habitum foedantur$$ They all live in filth and sloth ,  and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the Sarmatæ
 Venedi multum ex moribus traxerunt$$ The Veneti have borrowed largely from the Sarmatian character
 Nam quidquid inter Peucinos Fennosque silvarum ac montium erigitur , latrociniis pererrant$$ in their plundering expeditions they roam over the whole extent of forest and mountain between the Peucini and Fenni
 Hi tamen inter Germanos potius referuntur , quia et domos figunt et scuta gestant et pedum usu ac pernicitate gaudent$$ They are however to be rather referred to the German race ,  for they have fixed habitations ,  carry shields ,  and delight in strength and fleetness of foot ,  thus presenting a complete contrast to the Sarmatæ ,  who live in waggons and on horseback
 quae omnia diversa Sarmatis sunt , in plaustro equoque viventibus$$ The Fenni are strangely beastlike and squalidly poor
 Fennis mira feritas , foeda paupertas$$ neither arms nor homes have they
 non arma , non equi , non penates$$ their food is herbs ,  their clothing skins ,  their bed the earth
 victui herba , vestitui pelles , cubile humus$$ They trust wholly to their arrows ,  which ,  for want of iron ,  are pointed with bone
 sola in sagittis spes , quas , inopia ferri , ossibus asperant$$ The men and the women are alike supplied by the chase
 Idemque venatus viros pariter ac feminas alit$$ for the latter are always present ,  and demand a share of the prey
 Passim enim comitantur , partemque praedae petunt$$ The little children have no shelter from wild beasts and storms but a covering of interlaced boughs
 Nec aliud infantibus ferarum imbriumque suffugium , quam ut in aliquo ramorum nexu contegantur$$ Such are the homes of the young ,  such the resting place of the old
 huc redeunt juvenes , hoc senum receptaculum Sed beatius arbitrantur , quam ingemere agris , illaborare domibus , suas alienasque fortunas spe metuque versare$$ Yet they count this greater happiness than groaning over field-labour ,  toiling at building ,  and poising the fortunes of themselves and others between hope and fear
 Securi adversus homines , securi adversus deos , rem difficillimam assecuti sunt , ut illis ne vote quidem opus esset$$ Heedless of men ,  heedless of gods ,  they have attained that hardest of results ,  the not needing so much as a wish
 Legimus , cum Aruleno Rustico Paetus Thrasea , Herennio Senecioni Priscus Helvidius laudati essent , capitale fuisse , neque in ipsos modo auctores , sed in libros quoque eorum saevitum , delegato triumviris ministerio ut monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro urerentur$$ We have read that the panegyrics pronounced by Arulenus Rusticus on Rictus Thrasea ,  and by Herennius Senecio on Priscus Helvidius ,  were made capital crimes ,  that not only their persons but their very books were objects of rage ,  and that the triumvirs were commissioned to burn in the forum those works of splendid genius
 Scilicet illo igne vocem populi Romani et libertatem senatus et conscientiam generis humani aboleri arbitrabantur , expulsis insuper sapientiae professoribus atque omni bona arte in exilium acta , ne quid usquam honestum occurreret$$ They fancied ,  forsooth that in that fire the voice of the Roman people ,  the freedom of the Senate ,  and the conscience of the human race were perishing ,  while at the same time they banished the teachers of philosophy ,  and exiled every noble pursuit ,  that nothing good might anywhere confront them
 Dedimus profecto grande patientiae documentum$$ Certainly we showed a magnificent example of patience
 et sicut vetus aetas vidit quid ultimum in libertate esset , ita nos quid in servitute , adempto per inquisitiones etiam loquendi audiendique commercio$$ as a former age had witnessed the extreme of liberty ,  so we witnessed the extreme of servitude ,  when the informer robbed us of the interchange of speech and hearing
 Memoriam quoque ipsam cum voce perdidissemus , si tam in nostra potestate esset oblivisci quam tacere$$ We should have lost memory as well as voice ,  had it been as easy to forget as to keep silence
 Nunc demum redit animus$$ Now at last our spirit is returning
 et quamquam primo statim beatissimi saeculi ortu Nerva Caesar res olim dissociabilis miscuerit , principatum ac libertatem , augeatque cotidie felicitatem temporum Nerva Traianus , nec spem modo ac votum securitas publica , sed ipsius voti fiduciam ac robur adsumpserit , natura tamen infirmitatis humanae tardiora sunt remedia quam mala$$ And yet ,  though at the dawn of a most happy age Nerva Cæsar blended things once irreconcilable ,  sovereignty and freedom ,  though Nerva Trajan is now daily augmenting the prosperity of the time ,  and though the public safety has not only our hopes and good wishes ,  but has also the certain pledge of their fulfillment ,  still ,  from the necessary condition of human frailty ,  the remedy works less quickly than the disease
 et ut corpora nostra lente augescunt , cito extinguuntur , sic ingenia studiaque oppresseris facilius quam revocaveris$$ As our bodies grow but slowly ,  perish in a moment ,  so it is easier to crush than to revive genius and its pursuits
 subit quippe etiam ipsius inertiae dulcedo , et invisa primo desidia postremo amatur$$ Besides ,  the charm of indolence steals over us ,  and the idleness which at first we loathed we afterwards love
 Quid , si per quindecim annos , grande mortalis aevi spatium , multi fortuitis casibus , promptissimus quisque saevitia principis interciderunt , pauci et , ut ita dixerim , non modo aliorum sed etiam nostri superstites sumus , exemptis e media vita tot annis , quibus iuvenes ad senectutem , senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis terminos per silentium venimus Non tamen pigebit vel incondita ac rudi voce memoriam prioris servitutis ac testimonium praesentium bonorum composuisse$$ What if during those fifteen years ,  a large portion of human life ,  many were cut off by ordinary casualties ,  and the ablest fell victims to the Emperor's rage ,  if a few of us survive ,  I may almost say ,  not only others but our ownselves ,  survive ,  though there have been taken from the midst of life those many years which brought the young in dumb silence to old age ,  and the old almost to the very verge and end of existence! Yet we shall not regret that we have told ,  though in language unskilful and unadorned ,  the story of past servitude ,  and borne our testimony to present happiness
 Hic interim liber honori Agricolae soceri mei destinatus , professione pietatis aut laudatus erit aut excusatus$$ Meanwhile this book ,  intended to do honour to Agricola ,  my father-in-law ,  will ,  as an expression of filial regard ,  be commended ,  or at least excused

 In huius sinu indulgentiaque educatus per omnem honestarum artium cultum pueritiam adulescentiamque transegit$$ Brought up by her side with fond affection ,  he passed his boyhood and youth in the cultivation of every worthy attainment
 Arcebat eum ab inlecebris peccantium praeter ipsius bonam integramque naturam , quod statim parvulus sedem ac magistram studiorum Massiliam habuit , locum Graeca comitate et provinciali parsimonia mixtum ac bene compositum$$ He was guarded from the enticements of the profligate not only by his own good and straightforward character ,  but also by having ,  when quite a child ,  for the scene and guide of his studies ,  Massilia ,  a place where refinement and provincial frugality were blended and happily combined
 Memoria teneo solitum ipsum narrare se prima in iuventa studium philosophiae acrius , ultra quam concessum Romano ac senatori , hausisse , ni prudentia matris incensum ac flagrantem animum coercuisset$$ I remember that he used to tell us how in his early youth he would have imbibed a keener love of philosophy than became a Roman and a senator ,  had not his mother's good sense checked his excited and ardent spirit
 Scilicet sublime et erectum ingenium pulchritudinem ac speciem magnae excelsaeque gloriae vehementius quam caute adpetebat$$ It was the case of a lofty and aspiring soul craving with more eagerness than caution the beauty and splendour of great and glorious renown
 Mox mitigavit ratio et aetas , retinuitque , quod est difficillimum , ex sapientia modum$$ But it was soon mellowed by reason and experience ,  and he retained from his learning that most difficult of lessons moderation
 Prima castrorum rudimenta in Britannia Suetonio Paulino , diligenti ac moderato duci , adprobavit , electus quem contubernio aestimaret Nec Agricola licenter , more iuvenum qui militiam in lasciviam vertunt , neque segniter ad voluptates et commeatus titulum tribunatus et inscitiam rettulit$$ He served his military apprenticeship in Britain to the satisfaction of Suetonius Paullinus ,  a painstaking and judicious officer ,  who ,  to test his merits ,  selected him to share his tent
 sed noscere provinciam , nosci exercitui , discere a peritis , sequi optimos , nihil adpetere in iactationem , nihil ob formidinem recusare , simulque et anxius et intentus agere Non sane alias exercitatior magisque in ambiguo Britannia fuit trucidati veterani , incensae coloniae , intercepti exercitus$$ Without the recklessness with which young men often make the profession of arms a mere pastime ,  and without indolence ,  he never availed himself of his tribune's rank or his inexperience to procure enjoyment or to escape from duty
 tum de salute , mox de victoria certavere Quae cuncta etsi consiliis ductuque alterius agebantur , ac summa rerum et recuperatae provinciae gloria in ducem cessit , artem et usum et stimulos addidere iuveni , intravitque animum militaris gloriae cupido , ingrata temporibus quibus sinistra erga eminentis interpretatio nec minus periculum ex magna fama quam ex mala$$ He sought to make himself acquainted with the province and known to the army he would learn from the skilful ,  and keep pace with the bravest ,  would attempt nothing for display ,  would avoid nothing from fear ,  and would be at once careful and vigilant
 Hinc ad capessendos magistratus in urbem degressus Domitiam Decidianam , splendidis natalibus ortam , sibi iunxit idque matrimonium ad maiora nitenti decus ac robur fuit vixeruntque mira concordia , per mutuam caritatem et in vicem se anteponendo , nisi quod in bona uxore tanto maior laus , quanto in mala plus culpae est Sors quaesturae provinciam Asiam , pro consule Salvium Titianum dedit , quorum neutro corruptus est , quamquam et provincia dives ac parata peccantibus , et pro consule in omnem aviditatem pronus quantalibet facilitate redempturus esset mutuam dissimulationem mali$$ From Britain he went to Rome ,  to go through the regular course of office ,  and there allied himself with Domitia Decidiana ,  a lady of illustrious birth The marriage was one which gave a man ambitious of advancement distinction and support
 Auctus est ibi filia , in subsidium simul ac solacium nam filium ante sublatum brevi amisit Mox inter quaesturam ac tribunatum plebis atque ipsum etiam tribunatus annum quiete et otio transiit , gnarus sub Nerone temporum , quibus inertia pro sapientia fuit$$ They lived in singular harmony ,  through their mutual affection and preference of each other to self
 Idem praeturae tenor et silentium nec enim iurisdictio obvenerat Ludos et inania honoris medio rationis atque abundantiae duxit , uti longe a luxuria ita famae propior Tum electus a Galba ad dona templorum recognoscenda diligentissima conquisitione effecit , ne cuius alterius sacrilegium res publica quam Neronis sensisset$$ However ,  the good wife deserves the greater praise ,  just as the bad incurs a heavier censure
 Sequens annus gravi vulnere animum domumque eius adflixit Nam classis Othoniana licenter vaga dum Intimilium (Liguriae pars est) hostiliter populatur , matrem Agricolae in praediis suis interfecit , praediaque ipsa et magnam patrimonii partem diripuit , quae causa caedis fuerat$$ The following year inflicted a terrible blow on his affections and his fortunes Otho's fleet ,  while cruising idly about ,  cruelly ravaged Intemelii ,  a district of Liguria

 Is missum ad dilectus agendos Agricolam integreque ac strenue versatum vicesimae legioni tarde ad sacramentum transgressae praeposuit , ubi decessor seditiose agere narrabatur quippe legatis quoque consularibus nimia ac formidolosa erat , nec legatus praetorius ad cohibendum potens , incertum suo an militum ingenio$$ This was indeed the occasion of the crime Agricola ,  who instantly set out to discharge the duties of affection ,  was overtaken by the tidings that Vespasian was aiming at the throne He at once joined his party
 Ita successor simul et ultor electus rarissima moderatione maluit videri invenisse bonos quam fecisse$$ Vespasian's early policy ,  and the government of Rome were directed by Mucianus ,  for Domitian was a mere youth ,  and from his father's elevation sought only the opportunities of indulgence

 Credunt plerique militaribus ingeniis subtilitatem deesse , quia castrensis iurisdictio secura et obtusior ac plura manu agens calliditatem fori non exerceat$$ Many think the genius of the soldier wants subtlety ,  because military law ,  which is summary and blunt ,  and apt to appeal to the sword ,  finds no exercise for the refinements of the forum

 Integritatem atque abstinentiam in tanto viro referre iniuria virtutum fuerit$$ To speak of uprightness and purity in such a man would be an insult to his virtues
 Ne famam quidem , cui saepe etiam boni indulgent , ostentanda virtute aut per artem quaesivit$$ Fame itself ,  of which even good men are often weakly fond ,  he did not seek by an ostentation of virtue or by artifice
 procul ab aemulatione adversus collegas , procul a contentione adversus procuratores , et vincere inglorium et atteri sordidum arbitrabatur$$ He avoided rivalry with his colleagues ,  contention with his procurator ,  thinking such victories no honour and defeat disgrace
 Minus triennium in ea legatione detentus ac statim ad spem consulatus revocatus est , comitante opinione Britanniam ei provinciam dari , nullis in hoc ipsius sermonibus , sed quia par videbatur$$ For somewhat less than three years he was kept in his governorship ,  and was then recalled with an immediate prospect of the consulate A general belief went with him that the province of Britain was to be his ,  not because he had himself hinted it ,  but because he seemed worthy of it
 Haud semper errat fama$$ Public opinion is not always mistaken
 aliquando et eligit$$ sometimes even it chooses the right man
 Consul egregiae tum spei filiam iuveni mihi despondit ac post consulatum collocavit , et statim Britaniae praepositus est , adiecto pontificatus sacerdotio$$ He was consul ,  and I but a youth ,  when he betrothed to me his daughter ,  a maiden even then of noble promise After his consulate he gave her to me in marriage ,  and was then at once appointed to the government of Britain ,  with the addition of the sacred office of the pontificate
 Britanniae situm populosque multis scriptoribus memoratos non in comparationem curae ingeniive referam , sed quia tum primum perdomita est Ita quae priores nondum comperta eloquentia percoluere , rerum fide tradentur Britannia , insularum quas Romana notitia complectitur maxima , spatio ac caelo in orientem Germaniae , in occidentem Hispaniae obtenditur , Gallis in meridiem etiam inspicitur septentrionalia eius , nullis contra terris , vasto atque aperto mari pulsantur Formam totius Britanniae Livius veterum , Fabius Rusticus recentium eloquentissimi auctores oblongae scutulae vel bipenni adsimulavere Et est ea facies citra Caledoniam , unde et in universum fama est transgressis inmensum et enorme spatium procurrentium extremo iam litore terrarum velut in cuneum tenuatur Hanc oram novissimi maris tunc primum Romana classis circumvecta insulam esse Britanniam adfirmavit , ac simul incognitas ad id tempus insulas , quas Orcadas vocant , invenit domuitque$$ The geography and inhabitants of Britain ,  already described by many writers ,  I will speak of ,  not that my research and ability may be compared with theirs ,  but because the country was then for the first time thoroughly subdued
 Dispecta est et Thule , quia hactenus iussum , et hiems adpetebat Sed mare pigrum et grave remigantibus perhibent ne ventis quidem perinde attolli , credo quod rariores terrae montesque , causa ac materia tempestatum , et profunda moles continui maris tardius impellitur Naturam Oceani atque aestus neque quaerere huius operis est , ac multi rettulere unum addiderim , nusquam latius dominari mare , multum fluminum huc atque illuc ferre , nec litore tenus adcrescere aut resorberi , sed influere penitus atque ambire , et iugis etiam ac montibus inseri velut in suo$$ And so matters ,  which as being still not accurately known my predecessors embellished with their eloquence ,  shall now be related on the evidence of facts
 Ceterum Britanniam qui mortales initio coluerint , indigenae an advecti , ut inter barbaros , parum compertum$$ Who were the original inhabitants of Britain ,  whether they were indigenous or foreign ,  is ,  as usual among barbarians ,  little known
 Habitus corporum varii atque ex eo argumenta$$ Their physical characteristics are various ,  and from these conclusions may be drawn
 Namque rutilae Caledoniam habitantium comae , magni artus Germanicam originem adseverant$$ The red hair and large limbs of the inhabitants of Caledonia point clearly to a German origin
 Silurum colorati vultus , torti plerumque crines et posita contra Hispania Hiberos veteres traiecisse easque sedes occupasse fidem faciunt$$ The dark complexion of the Silures ,  their usually curly hair ,  and the fact that Spain is the opposite shore to them ,  are an evidence that Iberians of a former date crossed over and occupied these parts
 proximi Gallis et similes sunt , seu durante originis vi , seu procurrentibus in diversa terris positio caeli corporibus habitum dedit$$ Those who are nearest to the Gauls are also like them ,  either from the permanent influence of original descent ,  or ,  because in countries which run out so far to meet each other ,  climate has produced similar physical qualities
 In universum tamen aestimanti Gallos vicinam insulam occupasse credibile est$$ But a general survey inclines me to believe that the Gauls established themselves in an island so near to them
 Eorum sacra deprehendas ac superstitionum persuasiones$$ Their religious belief may be traced in the strongly-marked British superstition
 sermo haud multum diversus , in deposcendis periculis eadem audacia et , ubi advenere , in detrectandis eadem formido$$ The language differs but little there is the same boldness in challenging danger ,  and ,  when it is near ,  the same timidity in shrinking from it
 Plus tamen ferociae Britanni praeferunt , ut quos nondum longa pax emollierit$$ The Britons ,  however ,  exhibit more spirit ,  as being a people whom a long peace has not yet enervated
 Nam Gallos quoque in bellis floruisse accepimus$$ Indeed we have understood that even the Gauls were once renowned in war
 mox segnitia cum otio intravit , amissa virtute pariter ac libertate$$ but ,  after a while ,  sloth following on ease crept over them ,  and they lost their courage along with their freedom

 ita singuli pugnant , universi vincuntur Caelum crebris imbribus ac nebulis foedum asperitas frigorum abest Dierum spatia ultra nostri orbis mensuram nox clara et extrema Britanniae parte brevis , ut finem atque initium lucis exiguo discrimine internoscas$$ They were once ruled by kings ,  but are now divided under chieftains into factions and parties
 Quod si nubes non officiant , aspici per noctem solis fulgorem , nec occidere et exurgere , sed transire adfirmant Scilicet extrema et plana terrarum humili umbra non erigunt tenebras , infraque caelum et sidera nox cadit$$ Our greatest advantage in coping with tribes so powerful is that they do not act in concert
 Solum praeter oleam vitemque et cetera calidioribus terris oriri sueta patiens frugum pecudumque fecundum tarde mitescunt , cito proveniunt eademque utriusque rei causa , multus umor terrarum caelique$$ Seldom is it that two or three states meet together to ward off a common danger
 Fert Britannia aurum et argentum et alia metalla , pretium victoriae Gignit et Oceanus margarita , sed subfusca ac liventia$$ Thus ,  while they fight singly ,  all are conquered
 Ipsi Britanni dilectum ac tributa et iniuncta imperii munia impigre obeunt , si iniuriae absint$$ The Britons themselves bear cheerfully the conscription ,  the taxes ,  and the other burdens imposed on ,  them by the Empire ,  if there be no oppression
 has aegre tolerant , iam domiti ut pareant , nondum ut serviant$$ Of this they are impatient
 Igitur primus omnium Romanorum divus Iulius cum exercitu Britanniam ingressus , quamquam prospera pugna terruerit incolas ac litore potitus sit , potest videri ostendisse posteris , non tradidisse$$ they are reduced to subjection ,  not as yet to slavery The deified Julius ,  the very first Roman who entered Britain with an army ,  though by a successful engagement he struck terror into the inhabitants and gained possession of the coast 
 Mox bella civilia et in rem publicam versa principum arma , ac longa oblivio Britanniae etiam in pace$$  must be regarded as having indicated rather than transmitted the acquisition to future generations
 consilium id divus Augustus vocabat , Tiberius praeceptum Agitasse Gaium Caesarem de intranda Britannia satis constat , ni velox ingenio mobili paenitentiae , et ingentes adversus Germaniam conatus frustra fuissent Divus Claudius auctor iterati operis , transvectis legionibus auxiliisque et adsumpto in partem rerum Vespasiano , quod initium venturae mox fortunae fuit domitae gentes , capti reges et monstratus fatis Vespasianus$$ Then came the civil wars ,  and the arms of our leaders were turned against their country ,  and even when there was peace ,  there was a long neglect of Britain This Augustus spoke of as policy Tiberius as an inherited maxim That Caius Cæsar meditated an invasion of Britain is perfectly clear ,  but his purposes ,  rapidly formed ,  were easily changed ,  and his vast attempts on Germany had failed Claudius was the first to renew the attempt ,  and conveyed over into the island some legions and auxiliaries ,  choosing Vespasian to share with him the campaign ,  whose approaching elevation had this beginning
 Consularium primus Aulus Plautius praepositus ac subinde Ostorius Scapula , uterque bello egregius$$ Aulus Plautius was the first governor of consular rank ,  and Ostorius Scapula the next
 redactaque paulatim in formam provinciae proxima pars Britanniae , addita insuper veteranorum colonia$$ Both were famous soldiers ,  and by degrees the nearest portions of Britain were brought into the condition of a province ,  and a colony of veterans was also introduced
 Quaedam civitates Cogidumno regi donatae (is ad nostram usque memoriam fidissimus mansit) , vetere ac iam pridem recepta populi Romani consuetudine , ut haberet instrumenta servitutis et reges$$ Some of the states were given to king Cogidumnus ,  who lived down to our day a most faithful ally So was maintained the ancient and long-recognised practice of the Roman people ,  which seeks to secure among the instruments of dominion even kings themselves
 Mox Didius Gallus parta a prioribus continuit , paucis admodum castellis in ulteriora promotis , per quae fama aucti officii quaereretur$$ Soon after ,  Didius Gallus consolidated the conquests of his predecessors ,  and advanced a very few positions into parts more remote ,  to gain the credit of having enlarged the sphere of government
 Didium Veranius excepit , isque intra annum extinctus est$$ Didius was succeeded by Veranius ,  who died within the year
 Suetonius hinc Paulinus biennio prosperas res habuit , subactis nationibus firmatisque praesidiis$$ Then Suetonius Paullinus enjoyed success for two years he subdued several tribes and strengthened our military posts
 quorum fiducia Monam insulam ut vires rebellibus ministrantem adgressus terga occasioni patefecit$$ Thus encouraged ,  he made an attempt on the island of Mona ,  as a place from which the rebels drew reinforcements
 Namque absentia legati remoto metu Britanni agitare inter se mala servitutis , conferre iniurias et interpretando accendere$$ Relieved from apprehension by the legate's absence ,  the Britons dwelt much among themselves on the miseries of subjection ,  compared their wrongs ,  and exaggerated them in the discussion
 nihil profici patientia nisi ut graviora tamquam ex facili tolerantibus imperentur$$ All we get by patience ,  they said ,  is that heavier demands are exacted from us ,  as from men who will readily submit
 Singulos sibi olim reges fuisse , nunc binos imponi , e quibus legatus in sanguinem , procurator in bona saeviret$$ A single king once ruled us now two are set over us a legate to tyrannise over our lives ,  a procurator to tyrannise over our property

 Nihil iam cupiditati , nihil libidini exceptum$$ Nothing is now safe from their avarice ,  nothing from their lust
 In proelio fortiorem esse qui spoliet$$ In war it is the strong who plunders
 nunc ab ignavis plerumque et imbellibus eripi domos , abstrahi liberos , iniungi dilectus , tamquam mori tantum pro patria nescientibus$$ now ,  it is for the most part by cowards and poltroons that our homes are rifled ,  our children torn from us ,  the conscription enforced ,  as though it were for our country alone that we could not die
 Quantulum enim transisse militum , si sese Britanni numerent$$ For ,  after all ,  what a mere handful of soldiers has crossed over ,  if we Britons look at our own numbers
 Sic Germanias excussisse iugum$$ Germany did thus actually shake off the yoke ,  and yet its defence was a river ,  not the ocean
 et flumine , non Oceano defendi$$ With us ,  fatherland ,  wives ,  parents ,  are the motives to war
 Sibi patriam coniuges parentes , illis avaritiam et luxuriam causas belli esse$$ with them ,  only greed and profligacy
 Recessuros , ut divus Iulius recessisset , modo virtutem maiorum suorum aemularentur$$ They will surely fly ,  as did the now deified Julius ,  if once we emulate the valour of our sires
 Neve proelii unius aut alterius eventu pavescerent$$ Let us not be panicstricken at the result of one or two engagements
 plus impetus felicibus , maiorem constantiam penes miseros esse$$ The miserable have more fury and greater resolution
 Iam Britannorum etiam deos misereri , qui Romanum ducem absentem , qui relegatum in alia insula exercitum detinerent$$ Now even the gods are beginning to pity us ,  for they are keeping away the Roman general ,  and detaining his army far from us in another island
 iam ipsos , quod difficillimum fuerit , deliberare$$ We have already taken the hardest step
 Porro in eius modi consiliis periculosius esse deprehendi quam audere$$ we are deliberating
 His atque talibus in vicem instincti , Boudicca generis regii femina duce (neque enim sexum in imperiis discernunt) sumpsere universi bellum$$ Rousing each other by this and like language ,  under the leadership of Boudicea ,  a woman of kingly descent (for they admit no distinction of sex in their royal successions) ,  they all rose in arms
 ac sparsos per castella milites consectati , expugnatis praesidiis ipsam coloniam invasere ut sedem servitutis , nec ullum in barbaris ingeniis saevitiae genus omisit ira et victoria$$ They fell upon our troops ,  which were scattered on garrison duty ,  stormed the forts ,  and burst into the colony itself ,  the head-quarters ,  as they thought ,  of tyranny
 Quod nisi Paulinus cognito provinciae motu propere subvenisset , amissa Britannia foret$$ In their rage and their triumph ,  they spared no variety of a barbarian's cruelty
 quam unius proelii fortuna veteri patientiae restituit , tenentibus arma plerisque , quos conscientia defectionis et proprius ex legato timor agitabat , ne quamquam egregius cetera adroganter in deditos et ut suae cuiusque iniuriae ultor durius consuleret$$ Had not Paullinus on hearing of the outbreak in the province rendered prompt succour ,  Britain would have been lost By one successful engagement ,  he brought it back to its former obedience ,  though many ,  troubled by the conscious guilt of rebellion and by particular dread of the legate ,  still clung to their arms
 Missus igitur Petronius Turpilianus tamquam exorabilior et delictis hostium novus eoque paenitentiae mitior , compositis prioribus nihil ultra ausus Trebellio Maximo provinciam tradidit$$ Excellent as he was in other respects ,  his policy to the conquered was arrogant ,  and exhibited the cruelty of one who was avenging private wrongs
 Trebellius segnior et nullis castorum experimentis , comitate quadam curandi provinciam tenuit$$ Accordingly Petronius Turpilianus was sent out to initiate a milder rule
 Didicere iam barbari quoque ignoscere vitiis blandientibus , et interventus civilium armorum praebuit iustam segnitiae excusationem$$ A stranger to the enemy's misdeeds and so more accessible to their penitence ,  he put an end to old troubles ,  and ,  attempting nothing more ,  handed the province over to Trebellius Maximus
 sed discordia laboratum , cum adsuetus expeditionibus miles otio lasciviret$$ Trebellius ,  who was somewhat indolent ,  and never ventured on a campaign ,  controlled the province by a certain courtesy in his administration
 Trebellius , fuga ac latebris vitata exercitus ira , indecorus atque humilis precario mox praefuit , ac velut pacta exercitus licentia , ducis salute , et seditio sine sanguine stetit$$ Even the barbarians now learnt to excuse many attractive vices ,  and the occurrence of the civil war gave a good pretext for inaction But we were sorely troubled with mutiny ,  as troops habituated to service grew demoralised by idleness
 Nec Vettius Bolanus , manentibus adhuc civilibus bellis , agitavit Britanniam disciplina$$ Trebellius ,  who had escaped the soldiers' fury by flying and hiding himself ,  governed henceforth on sufferance ,  a disgraced and humbled man
 eadem inertia erga hostis , similis petulantia castrorum , nisi quod innocens Bolanus et nullis delictis invisus caritatem paraverat loco auctoritatis$$ It was a kind of bargain the soldiers had their licence ,  the general had his life and so the mutiny cost no bloodshed
 Sed ubi cum cetero orbe Vespasianus et Britanniam recuperavit , magni duces , egregii exercitus , minuta hostium spes$$ When however Vespasian had restored to unity Britain as well as the rest of the world ,  in the presence of great generals and renowned armies the enemy's hopes were crushed
 Et terrorem statim intulit Petilius Cerialis , Brigantum civitatem , quae numerosissima provinciae totius perhibetur , adgressus$$ They were at once panic-stricken by the attack of Petilius Cerialis on the state of the Brigantes ,  said to be the most prosperous in the entire province
 Multa proelia , et aliquando non incruenta magnamque Brigantum partem aut victoria amplexus est aut bello$$ There were many battles ,  some by no means bloodless ,  and his conquests ,  or at least his wars ,  embraced a large part of the territory of the Brigantes
 Et Cerialis quidem alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset$$ Indeed he would have altogether thrown into the shade the activity and renown of any other successor
 subiit sustinuitque molem Iulius Frontinus , vir magnus , quantum licebat , validamque et pugnacem Silurum gentem armis subegit , super virtutem hostium locorum quoque difficultates eluctatus$$ but Julius Frontinus was equal to the burden ,  a great man as far as greatness was then possible ,  who subdued by his arms the powerful and warlike tribe of the Silures ,  surmounting the difficulties of the country as well as the valour of the enemy
 Hunc Britanniae statum , has bellorum vices media iam aestate transgressus Agricola invenit , cum et milites velut omissa expeditione ad securitatem et hostes ad occasionem verterentur$$ Such was the state of Britain ,  and such were the vicissitudes of the war ,  which Agricola found on his crossing over about midsummer
 Ordovicum civitas haud multo ante adventum eius alam in finibus suis agentem prope universam obtriverat , eoque initio erecta provincia$$ Our soldiers made it a pretext for carlessness ,  as if all fighting was over ,  and the enemy were biding their time
 Et quibus bellum volentibus erat , probare exemplum ac recentis legati animum opperiri , cum Agricola , quamquam transvecta aestas , sparsi per provinciam numeri , praesumpta apud militem illius anni quies , tarda et contraria bellum incohaturo , et plerisque custodiri suspecta potius videbatur , ire obviam discrimini statuit$$ The Ordovices ,  shortly before Agricola's arrival ,  had destroyed nearly the whole of a squadron of allied cavalry quartered in their territory
 contractisque legionum vexillis et modica auxiliorum manu , quia in aequum degredi Ordovices non audebant , ipse ante agmen , quo ceteris par animus simili periculo esset , erexit aciem$$ Such a beginning raised the hopes of the country ,  and all who wished for war approved the precedent ,  and anxiously watched the temper of the new governor
 Caesaque prope universa gente , non ignarus instandum famae ac , prout prima cessissent , terrorem ceteris fore , Monam insulam , cuius possessione revocatum Paulinum rebellione totius Britanniae supra memoravi , redigere in potestatem animo intendit Sed , ut in subitis consiliis , naves deerant ratio et constantia ducis transvexit Depositis omnibus sarcinis lectissimos auxiliarium , quibus nota vada et patrius nandi usus , quo simul seque et arma et equos regunt , ita repente inmisit , ut obstupefacti hostes , qui classem , qui navis , qui mare expectabant , nihil arduum aut invictum crediderint sic ad bellum venientibus$$ Meanwhile Agricola ,  though summer was past and the detachments were scattered throughout the province ,  though the soldiers' confident anticipation of inaction for that year would be a source of delay and difficulty in beginning a campaign ,  and most advisers thought it best simply to watch all weak points ,  resolved to face the peril
 Ita petita pace ac dedita insula clarus ac magnus haberi Agricola , quippe cui ingredienti provinciam , quod tempus alii per ostentationem et officiorum ambitum transigunt , labor et periculum placuisset Nec Agricola prosperitate rerum in vanitatem usus , expeditionem aut victoriam vocabat victos continuisse ne laureatis quidem gesta prosecutus est , sed ipsa dissimulatione famae famam auxit , aestimantibus quanta futuri spe tam magna tacuisset$$ He collected a force of veterans and a small body of auxiliaries then as the Ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain ,  he put himself in front of the ranks to inspire all with the same courage against a common danger ,  and led his troops up a hill
 Ceterum animorum provinciae prudens , simulque doctus per aliena experimenta parum profici armis , si iniuriae sequerentur , causas bellorum statuit excidere$$ Next ,  with thorough insight into the feelings of his province ,  and taught also ,  by the experience of others ,  that little is gained by conquest if followed by oppression ,  he determined to root out the causes of war
 A se suisque orsus primum domum suam coercuit , quod plerisque haud minus arduum est quam provinciam regere$$ Beginning first with himself and his dependants ,  he kept his household under restraint ,  a thing as hard to many as ruling a province
 Nihil per libertos servosque publicae rei , non studiis privatis nec ex commendatione aut precibus centurionem militesve adscire , sed optimum quemque fidissimum putare$$ He transacted no public business through freedmen or slaves no private leanings ,  no recommendations or entreaties of friends ,  moved him in the selection of centurions and soldiers ,  but it was ever the best man whom he thought most trustworthy
 Omnia scire , non omnia exsequi$$ He knew everything ,  but did not always act on his knowledge
 Parvis peccatis veniam , magnis severitatem commodare$$ Trifling errors he treated with leniency ,  serious offences with severity
 nec poena semper , sed saepius paenitentia contentus esse$$ Nor was it always punishment ,  but far oftener penitence ,  which satisfied him
 officiis et administrationibus potius non peccaturos praeponere , quam damnare cum peccassent$$ He preferred to give office and power to men who would not transgress ,  rather than have to condemn a transgressor
 Frumenti et tributorum exactionem aequalitate munerum mollire , circumcisis quae in quaestum reperta ipso tributo gravius tolerabantur$$ He lightened the exaction of corn and tribute by an equal distribution of the burden ,  while he got rid of those contrivances for gain which were more intolerable than the tribute itself
 Namque per ludibrium adsidere clausis horreis et emere ultro frumenta ac luere pretio cogebantur$$ Hitherto the people had been compelled to endure the farce of waiting by the closed granary and of purchasing corn unnecessarily and raising it to a fictitious price
 Divortia itinerum et longinquitas regionum indicebatur , ut civitates proximis hibernis in remota et avia deferrent , donec quod omnibus in promptu erat paucis lucrosum fieret$$ Difficult by-roads and distant places were fixed for them ,  so that states with a winter-camp close to them had to carry corn to remote and inaccessible parts of the country ,  until what was within the reach of all became a source of profit to the few
 Tertius expeditionum annus novas gentis aperuit , vastatis usque ad Tanaum (aestuario nomen est) nationibus Qua formdine territi hostes quamquam conflictatum saevis tempestatibus exercitum lacessere non ausi$$ The third year of his campaigns opened up new tribes ,  our ravages on the native population being carried as far as the Taus ,  an estuary so called
 ponendisque insuper castellis spatium fuit Adnotabant periti non alium ducem opportunitates locorum sapientius legisse$$ This struck such terror into the enemy that he did not dare to attack our army ,  harassed though it was by violent storms
 Nullum ab Agricola positum castellum aut vi hostium expugnatum aut pactione ac fuga desertum$$ and there was even time for the erection of forts
 nam adversus moras obsidionis annuis copiis firmabantur Ita intrepida ibi hiems , crebrae eruptiones et sibi quisque praesidio , inritis hostibus eoque desperantibus , quia soliti plerumque damna aestatis hibernis eventibus pensare tum aestate atque hieme iuxta pellebantur$$ It was noted by experienced officers that no general had ever shown more judgment in choosing suitable positions ,  and that not a single fort established by Agricola was either stormed by the enemy or abandoned by capitulation or flight
 Nec Agricola umquam per alios gesta avidus intercepit$$ Sorties were continually made
 seu centurio seu praefectus incorruptum facti testem habebat$$ for these positions were secured from protracted siege by a year's supply
 Apud quosdam acerbior in conviciis narrabatur et ut erat comis bonis , ita adversus malos iniucundus Ceterum ex iracundia nihil supererat secretum , ut silentium eius non timeres honestius putabat offendere quam odisse$$ So winter brought with it no alarms ,  and each garrison could hold its own ,  as the baffled and despairing enemy ,  who had been accustomed often to repair his summer losses by winter successes ,  found himself repelled alike both in summer and winter
 Quinto expeditionum anno nave prima transgressus ignotas ad id tempus gentis crebris simul ac prosperis proeliis domuit$$ In the fifth year of the war Agricola ,  himself in the leading ship ,  crossed the Clota ,  and subdued in a series of victories tribes hitherto unknown
 eamque partem Britanniae quae Hiberniam aspicit copiis instruxit , in spem magis quam ob formidinem , si quidem Hibernia medio inter Britanniam atque Hispaniam sita et Gallico quoque mari opportuna valentissimam imperii partem magnis in vicem usibus miscuerit$$ In that part of Britain which looks towards Ireland ,  he posted some troops ,  hoping for fresh conquests rather than fearing attack ,  inasmuch as Ireland ,  being between Britain and Spain and conveniently situated for the seas round Gaul ,  might have been the means of connecting with great mutual benefit the most powerful parts of the empire
 Spatium eius , si Britanniae comparetur , angustius nostri maris insulas superat$$ Its extent is small when compared with Britain ,  but exceeds the islands of our seas
 Solum caelumque et ingenia cultusque hominum haud multum a Britannia differunt$$ In soil and climate ,  in the disposition ,  temper ,  and habits of its population ,  it differs but little from Britain
 in melius aditus portusque per commercia et negotiatores cogniti$$ We know most of its harbours and approaches ,  and that through the intercourse of commerce
 Agricola expulsum seditione domestica unum ex regulis gentis exceperat ac specie amicitiae in occasionem retinebat$$ One of the petty kings of the nation ,  driven out by internal faction ,  had been received by Agricola ,  who detained him under the semblance of friendship till he could make use of him
 Saepe ex eo audivi legione una et modicis auxiliis debellari obtinerique Hiberniam posse idque etiam adversus Britanniam profuturum , si Romana ubique arma et velut e conspectu libertas tolleretur$$ I have often heard him say that a single legion with a few auxiliaries could conquer and occupy Ireland ,  and that it would have a salutary effect on Britain for the Roman arms to be seen everywhere ,  and for freedom ,  so to speak ,  to be banished from its sight
 Ceterum aestate , qua sextum officii annum incohabat , amplexus civitates trans Bodotriam sitas , quia motus universarum ultra gentium et infesta hostilis exercitus itinera timebantur , portus classe exploravit quae ab Agricola primum adsumpta in partem virium sequebatur egregia specie , cum simul terra , simul mari bellum impelleretur , ac saepe isdem castris pedes equesque et nauticus miles mixti copiis et laetitia sua quisque facta , suos casus attollerent , ac modo silvarum ac montium profunda , modo tempestatum ac fluctuum adversa , hinc terra et hostis , hinc victus Oceanus militari iactantia compararentur$$ In the summer in which he entered on the sixth year of his office ,  his operations embraced the states beyond Bodotria ,  and ,  as he dreaded a general movement among the remoter tribes ,  as well as the perils which would beset an invading army ,  he explored the harbours with a fleet ,  which ,  at first employed by him as an integral part of his force ,  continued to accompany him The spectacle of war thus pushed on at once by sea and land was imposing while often infantry ,  cavalry ,  and marines ,  mingled in the same encampment and joyously sharing the same meals ,  would dwell on their own achievements and adventures ,  comparing ,  with a soldier's boastfulness ,  at one time the deep recesses of the forest and the mountain with the dangers of waves and storms ,  or ,  at another ,  battles by land with victories over the ocean
 Britannos quoque , ut ex captivis audiebatur , visa classis obstupefaciebat , tamquam aperto maris sui secreto ultimum victis perfugium clauderetur$$ The Britons too ,  as we learnt from the prisoners ,  were confounded by the sight of a fleet ,  as if ,  now that their inmost seas were penetrated ,  the conquered had their last refuge closed against them
 Ad manus et arma conversi Caledoniam incolentes populi magno paratu , maiore fama , uti mos est de ignotis , oppugnare ultro castellum adorti , metum ut provocantes addiderant$$ The tribes inhabiting Caledonia flew to arms ,  and with great preparations ,  made greater by the rumours which always exaggerate the unknown ,  themselves advanced to attack our fortresses ,  and thus ,  challenging a conflict ,  inspired us with alarm
 regrediendumque citra Bodotriam et cedendum potius quam pellerentur ignavi specie prudentium admonebant , cum interim cognoscit hostis pluribus agminibus inrupturos$$ To retreat south of the Bodotria ,  and to retire rather than to be driven out ,  was the advice of timid pretenders to prudence ,  when Agricola learnt that the enemy's attack would be made with more than one army
 Ac ne superante numero et peritia locorum circumiretur , diviso et ipso in tris partes exercitu incessit$$ Fearing that their superior numbers and their knowledge of the country might enable them to hem him in ,  he too distributed his forces into three divisions ,  and so advanced
 Quod ubi cognitum hosti , mutato repente consilio universi nonam legionem ut maxime invalidam nocte adgressi , inter somnum ac trepidationem caesis vigilibus inrupere$$ This becoming known to the enemy ,  they suddenly changed their plan ,  and with their whole force attacked by night the ninth Legion ,  as being the weakest ,  and cutting down the sentries ,  who were asleep or panic-stricken ,  they broke into the camp
 Iamque in ipsis castris pugnabatur , cum Agricola iter hostium ab exploratoribus edoctus et vestigiis insecutus , velocissimos equitum peditumque adsultare tergis pugnantium iubet , mox ab universis adici clamorem$$ And now the battle was raging within the camp itself ,  when Agricola ,  who had learnt from his scouts the enemy's line of march and had kept close on his track ,  ordered the most active soldiers of his cavalry and infantry to attack the rear of the assailants ,  while the entire army were shortly to raise a shout
 et propinqua luce fulsere signa$$ Soon his standards glittered in the light of daybreak
 Ita ancipiti malo territi Britanni$$ A double peril thus alarmed the Britons ,  while the courage of the Romans revived
 et nonanis rediit animus , ac securi pro salute de gloria certabant$$ and feeling sure of safety ,  they now fought for glory
 Ultro quin etiam erupere , et fuit atrox in ipsis portarum angustiis proelium , donec pulsi hostes , utroque exercitu certante , his , ut tulisse opem , illis , ne eguisse auxilio viderentur$$ In their turn they rushed to the attack ,  and there was a furious conflict within the narrow passages of the gates till the enemy were routed Both armies did their utmost ,  the one for the honour of having given aid ,  the other for that of not having needed support
 Quod nisi paludes et silvae fugientis texissent , debellatum illa victoria foret$$ Had not the flying enemy been sheltered by morasses and forests ,  this victory would have ended the war
 Cuius conscientia ac fama ferox exercitus nihil virtuti suae invium et penetrandam Caledoniam inveniendumque tandem Britanniae terminum continuo proeliorum cursu fremebant$$ Knowing this ,  and elated by their glory ,  our army exclaimed that nothing could resist their valour that they must penetrate the recesses of Caledonia ,  and at length after an unbroken succession of battles ,  discover the furthest limits of Britain
 Atque illi modo cauti ac sapientes prompti post eventum ac magniloqui erant$$ Those who but now were cautious and prudent ,  became after the event eager and boastful
 Iniquissima haec bellorum condicio est prospera omnes sibi vindicant , adversa uni imputantur$$ It is the singularly unfair peculiarity of war that the credit of success is claimed by all ,  while a disaster is attributed to one alone
 At Britanni non virtute se victos , sed occasione et arte ducis rati , nihil ex adrogantia remittere , quo minus iuventutem armarent , coniuges ac liberos in loca tuta transferrent , coetibus et sacrificiis conspirationem civitatum sancirent$$ But the Britons thinking themselves baffled ,  not so much by our valour as by our general's skilful use of an opportunity ,  abated nothing of their arrogant demeanour ,  arming their youth ,  removing their wives and children to a place of safety ,  and assembling together to ratify ,  with sacred rites ,  a confederacy of all their states
 Atque ita inritatis utrimque animis discessum$$ Thus ,  with angry feelings on both sides ,  the combatants parted
 Eadem aestate cohors Usiporum per Germanias conscripta et in Britanniam transmissa magnum ac memorabile facinus ausa est$$ The same summer a Usipian cohort ,  which had been levied in Germany and transported into Britain ,  ventured on a great and memorable exploit
 Occiso centurione ac militibus , qui ad tradendam disciplinam inmixti manipulis exemplum et rectores habebantur , tris liburnicas adactis per vim gubernatoribus ascendere$$ Having killed a centurion and some soldiers ,  who ,  to impart military discipline ,  had been incorporated with their ranks and were employed at once to instruct and command them ,  they embarked on board three swift galleys with pilots pressed into their service
 et uno remigante , suspectis duobus eoque interfectis , nondum vulgato rumore ut miraculum praevehebantur$$ Under the direction of one of them for two of the three they suspected and consequently put to death they sailed past the coast in the strangest way before any rumour about them was in circulation
 Mox ad aquam atque utilia raptum ubi adpulissent , cum plerisque Britannorum sua defensantium proelio congressi ac saepe victores , aliquando pulsi , eo ad extremum inopiae venere , ut infirmissimos suorum , mox sorte ductos vescerentur$$ After a while ,  dispersing in search of water and provisions ,  they encountered many of the Britons ,  who sought to defend their property Often victorious ,  though now and then beaten ,  they were at last reduced to such an extremity of want as to be compelled to eat ,  at first ,  the feeblest of their number ,  and then victims selected by lot
 Atque ita circumvecti Britanniam , amissis per inscitiam regendi navibus , pro praedonibus habiti , primum a Suebis , mox a Frisiis intercepti sunt$$ Having sailed round Britain and lost their vessels from not knowing how to manage them ,  they were looked upon as pirates and were intercepted ,  first by the Suevi and then by the Frisii
 Ac fuere quos per commercia venumdatos et in nostram usque ripam mutatione ementium adductos indicium tanti casus inlustravit$$ Some who were sold as slaves in the way of trade ,  and were brought through the process of barter as far as our side of the Rhine ,  gained notoriety by the disclosure of this extraordinary adventure
 Initio aestatis Agricola domestico vulnere ictus , anno ante natum filium amisit Quem casum neque ut plerique fortium virorum ambitiose , neque per lamenta rursus ac maerorem muliebriter tulit , et in luctu bellum inter remedia erat$$ Early in the summer Agricola sustained a domestic affliction in the loss of a son born a year before ,  a calamity which he endured ,  neither with the ostentatious fortitude displayed by many brave men ,  nor ,  on the other hand ,  with womanish tears and grief
 Igitur praemissa classe , quae pluribus locis praedata magnum et incertum terrorem faceret , expedito exercitu , cui ex Britannis fortissimos et longa pace exploratos addiderat , ad montem Graupium pervenit , quem iam hostis insederat$$ In his sorrow he found one source of relief in war Having sent on a fleet ,  which by its ravages at various points might cause a vague and wide-spread alarm ,  he advanced with a lightly equipped force ,  including in its ranks some Britons of remarkable bravery ,  whose fidelity had been tried through years of peace ,  as far as the Grampian mountains ,  which the enemy had already occupied
 Nam Britanni nihil fracti pugnae prioris eventu et ultionem aut servitium expectantes , tandemque docti commune periculum concordia propulsandum , legationibus et foederibus omnium civitatium vires exciverant$$ For the Britons ,  indeed ,  in no way cowed by the result of the late engagement ,  had made up their minds to be either avenged or enslaved ,  and convinced at length that a common danger must be averted by union ,  had ,  by embassies and treaties ,  summoned forth the whole strength of all their states
 Iamque super triginta milia armatorum aspiciebantur , et adhuc adfluebat omnis iuventus et quibus cruda ac viridis senectus , clari bello et sua quisque decora gestantes , cum inter pluris duces virtute et genere praestans nomine Calgacus apud contractam multitudinem proelium poscentem in hunc modum locutus fertur$$ More than 30 , 000 armed men were now to be seen ,  and still there were pressing in all the youth of the country ,  with all whose old age was yet hale and vigorous ,  men renowned in war and bearing each decorations of his own Meanwhile ,  among the many leaders ,  one superior to the rest in valour and in birth ,  Galgacus by name ,  is said to have thus harangued the multitude gathered around him and clamouring for battle 
 Quotiens causas belli et necessitatem nostram intueor , magnus mihi animus est hodiernum diem consensumque vestrum initium libertatis toti Britanniae fore$$ Whenever I consider the origin of this war and the necessities of our position ,  I have a sure confidence that this day ,  and this union of yours ,  will be the beginning of freedom to the whole of Britain
 nam et universi coistis et servitutis expertes , et nullae ultra terrae ac ne mare quidem securum inminente nobis classe Romana$$ To all of us slavery is a thing unknown there are no lands beyond us ,  and even the sea is not safe ,  menaced as we are by a Roman fleet
 Ita proelium atque arma , quae fortibus honesta , eadem etiam ignavis tutissima sunt$$ And thus in war and battle ,  in which the brave find glory ,  even the coward will find safety
 Priores pugnae , quibus adversus Romanos varia fortuna certatum est , spem ac subsidium in nostris manibus habebant , quia nobilissimi totius Britanniae eoque in ipsis penetralibus siti nec ulla servientium litora aspicientes , oculos quoque a contactu dominationis inviolatos habebamus Nos terrarum ac libertatis extremos recessus ipse ac sinus famae in hunc diem defendit$$ Former contests ,  in which ,  with varying fortune ,  the Romans were resisted ,  still left in us a last hope of succour ,  inasmuch as being the most renowned nation of Britain ,  dwelling in the very heart of the country ,  and out of sight of the shores of the conquered ,  we could keep even our eyes unpolluted by the contagion of slavery To us who dwell on the uttermost confines of the earth and of freedom ,  this remote sanctuary of Britain's glory has up to this time been a defence
 nunc terminus Britanniae patet , atque omne ignotum pro magnifico est$$ Now ,  however ,  the furthest limits of Britain are thrown open ,  and the unknown always passes for the marvellous
 sed nulla iam ultra gens , nihil nisi fluctus ac saxa , et infestiores Romani , quorum superbiam frustra per obsequium ac modestiam effugias$$ But there are no tribes beyond us ,  nothing indeed but waves and rocks ,  and the yet more terrible Romans ,  from whose oppression escape is vainly sought by obedience and submission
 Raptores orbis , postquam cuncta vastantibus defuere terrae , mare scrutantur$$ Robbers of the world ,  having by their universal plunder exhausted the land ,  they rifle the deep
 si locuples hostis est , avari , si pauper , ambitiosi , quos non Oriens , non Occidens satiaverit$$ If the enemy be rich ,  they are rapacious if he be poor ,  they lust for dominion
 soli omnium opes atque inopiam pari adfectu concupiscunt$$ neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them
 Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium , atque ubi solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant$$ Alone among men they covet with equal eagerness poverty and riches
 An eandem Romanis in bello virtutem quam in pace lasciviam adesse creditis$$ Do you suppose that the Romans will be as brave in war as they are licentious in peace
 Nostris illi dissensionibus ac discordiis clari vitia hostium in gloriam exercitus sui vertunt quem contractum ex diversissimis gentibus ut secundae res tenent , ita adversae dissolvent$$ To our strifes and discords they owe their fame ,  and they turn the errors of an enemy to the renown of their own army ,  an army which ,  composed as it is of every variety of nations ,  is held together by success and will be broken up by disaster
 nisi si Gallos et Germanos et (pudet dictu) Britannorum plerosque , licet dominationi alienae sanguinem commodent , diutius tamen hostis quam servos , fide et adfectu teneri putatis$$ These Gauls and Germans ,  and ,  I blush to say ,  these numerous Britons ,  who ,  though they lend their lives to support a stranger's rule ,  have been its enemies longer than its subjects ,  you cannot imagine to be bound by fidelity and affection
 Metus ac terror sunt infirma vincla caritatis$$ Fear and terror there certainly are ,  feeble bonds of attachment
 quae ubi removeris , qui timere desierint , odisse incipient$$ remove them ,  and those who have ceased to fear will begin to hate
 Omnia victoriae incitamenta pro nobis sunt$$ All the incentives to victory are on our side
 nullae Romanos coniuges accendunt , nulli parentes fugam exprobraturi sunt$$ The Romans have no wives to kindle their courage
 aut nulla plerisque patria aut alia est$$ no parents to taunt them with flight
 Paucos numero , trepidos ignorantia , caelum ipsum ac mare et silvas , ignota omnia circumspectantis , clausos quodam modo ac vinctos di nobis tradiderunt$$ many have either no country or one far away Few in number ,  dismayed by their ignorance ,  looking around upon a sky ,  a sea ,  and forests which are all unfamiliar to them
 Ne terreat vanus aspectus et auri fulgor atque argenti , quod neque tegit neque vulnerat$$ hemmed in ,  as it were ,  and enmeshed ,  the Gods have delivered them into our hands
 In ipsa hostium acie inveniemus nostras manus$$ Be not frightened by idle display ,  by the glitter of gold and of silver ,  which can neither protect nor wound
 adgnoscent Britanni suam causam , recordabuntur Galli priorem libertatem , tam deserent illos ceteri Germani quam nuper Usipi reliquerunt$$ In the very ranks of the enemy we shall find our own forces Britons will acknowledge their own cause
 Nec quicquam ultra formidinis$$ Gauls will remember past freedom
 vacua castella , senum coloniae , inter male parentis et iniuste imperantis aegra municipia et discordantia$$ the other Germans will abandon them ,  as but lately did the Usipii
 Hic dux , hic exercitus$$ Behind them there is nothing to dread
 ibi tributa et metalla et ceterae servientium poenae , quas in aeternum perferre aut statim ulcisci in hoc campo est$$ The forts are ungarrisoned the colonies in the hands of aged men
 Proinde ituri in aciem et maiores vestros et posteros cogitate$$ what with disloyal subjects and oppressive rulers ,  the towns are ill-affected and rife with discord
 Excepere orationem alacres , ut barbaris moris , fremitu cantuque et clamoribus dissonis Iamque agmina et armorum fulgores audentissimi cuiusque procursu simul instruebatur acies , cum Agricola quamquam laetum et vix munimentis coercitum militem accendendum adhuc ratus , ita disseruit septimus annus est , commilitones , ex quo virtute et auspiciis imperii Romani , fide atque opera vestra Britanniam vicistis$$ They received his speech with enthusiasm ,  and as is usual among barbarians ,  with songs ,  shouts and discordant cries
 Tot expeditionibus , tot proeliis , seu fortitudine adversus hostis seu patientia ac labore paene adversus ipsam rerum naturam opus fuit , neque me militum neque vos ducis paenituit Ergo egressi , ego veterum legatorum , vos priorum exercituum terminos , finem Britanniae non fama nec rumore , sed castris et armis tenemus inventa Britannia et subacta Equidem saepe in agmine , cum vos paludes montesve et flumina fatigarent , fortissimi cuiusque voces audiebam quando dabitur hostis , quando in manus veniet Veniunt , e latebris suis extrusi , et vota virtusque in aperto , omniaque prona victoribus atque eadem victis adversa Nam ut superasse tantum itineris , evasisse silvas , transisse aestuaria pulchrum ac decorum in frontem , ita fugientibus periculosissima quae hodie prosperrima sunt neque enim nobis aut locorum eadem notitia aut commeatuum eadem abundantia , sed manus et arma et in his omnia Quod ad me attinet , iam pridem mihi decretum est neque exercitus neque ducis terga tuta esse Proinde et honesta mors turpi vita potior , et incolumitas ac decus eodem loco sita sunt$$ And now was seen the assembling of troops and the gleam of arms ,  as the boldest warriors stepped to the fro ,  As the line was forming ,  Agricola ,  who ,  though his troop were in high spirits and could scarcely be kept within the entrenchments ,  still thought it right to encourage them ,  spoke as follows 
 Si novae gentes atque ignota acies constitisset , aliorum exercituum exemplis vos hortarer$$ If unknown nations and an untried enemy confronted you ,  I should urge you on by the example of other armies
 nunc vestra decora recensete , vestros oculos interrogate$$ As it is ,  look back upon your former honours ,  question your own eyes
 Hi sunt , quos proximo anno unam legionem furto noctis adgressos clamore debellastis$$ These are the men who last year under cover of darkness attacked a single legion ,  whom you routed by a shout
 hi ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi ideoque tam diu superstites$$ Of all the Britons these are the most confirmed runaways ,  and this is why they have survived so long
 Quo modo silvas saltusque penetrantibus fortissimum quodque animal contra ruere , pavida et inertia ipso agminis sono pellebantur , sic acerrimi Britannorum iam pridem ceciderunt , reliquus est numerus ignavorum et metuentium$$ Just a when the huntsman penetrates the forest and the thicket ,  all the most courageous animals rush out upon him ,  while the timid and feeble are scared away by the very sound of his approach ,  so the bravest of the Britons have long since fallen
 Quos quod tandem invenistis , non restiterunt , sed deprehensi sunt$$ and the rest are a mere crowd of spiritless cowards
 novissimae res et extremus metus torpore defixere aciem in his vestigiis , in quibus pulchram et spectabilem victoriam ederetis$$ You have at last found them ,  not because they have stood their ground ,  but because they have been overtaken
 Transigite cum expeditionibus , imponite quinquaginta annis magnum diem , adprobate rei publicae numquam exercitui imputari potuisse aut moras belli aut causas rebellandi$$ Their desperate plight ,  and the extreme terror that paralyses them ,  have rivetted their line to this spot ,  that you might achieve in it a splendid and memorable victory
 Et adloquente adhuc Agricola militum ardor eminebat , et finem orationis ingens alacritas consecuta est , statimque ad arma discursum$$ While Agricola was yet speaking ,  the ardour of the soldiers was rising to its height ,  and the close of his speech was followed by a great outburst of enthusiasm
 Instinctos ruentisque ita disposuit , ut peditum auxilia , quae octo milium erant , mediam aciem firmarent , equitum tria milia cornibus adfunderentur$$ In a moment they flew to arms He arrayed his eager and impetuous troops in such a manner that the auxiliary infantry ,  8 , 000 in number ,  strengthened his centre ,  while 3 , 000 cavalry were posted on his wings
 Legiones pro vallo stetere , ingens victoriae decus citra Romanum sanguinem bellandi , et auxilium , si pellerentur$$ The legions were drawn up in front of the intrenched camp his victory would be vastly more glorious if won without the loss of Roman blood ,  and he would have a reserve in case of repulse
 Britannorum acies in speciem simul ac terrorem editioribus locis constiterat ita , ut primum agmen in aequo , ceteri per adclive iugum conexi velut insurgerent$$ The enemy ,  to make a formidable display ,  had posted himself on high ground his van was on the plain ,  while the rest of his army rose in an arch-like form up the slope of a hill
 media campi covinnarius eques strepitu ac discursu complebat$$ The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry
 Tum Agricola superante hostium multitudine veritus , ne in frontem simul et latera suorum pugnaretur , diductis ordinibus , quamquam porrectior acies futura erat et arcessendas plerique legiones admonebant , promptior in spem et firmus adversis , dimisso equo pedes ante vexilla constitit$$ Agricola ,  fearing that from the enemy's superiority of force he would be simultaneously attacked in front and on the flanks ,  widened his ranks ,  and though his line was likely to be too extended ,  and several officers advised him to bring up the legions ,  yet ,  so sanguine was he ,  so resolute in meeting danger ,  he sent away his horse and took his stand on foot before the colours
 Ac primo congressu eminus certabatur$$ The action began with distant fighting
 simulque constantia , simul arte Britanni ingentibus gladiis et brevibus caetris missilia nostrorum vitare vel excutere , atque ipsi magnam vim telorum superfundere , donec Agricola quattuor Batavorum cohortis ac Tungrorum duas cohortatus est , ut rem ad mucrones ac manus adducerent$$ The Britons with equal steadiness and skill used their huge swords and small shields to avoid or to parry the missiles of our soldiers ,  while they themselves poured on us a dense shower of darts ,  till Agricola encouraged three Batavian and two Tungrian cohorts to bring matters to the decision of close fighting with swords
 quod et ipsis vetustate militiae exercitatum et hostibus inhabile parva scuta et enormis gladios gerentibus$$ Such tactics were familiar to these veteran soldiers ,  but were embarrassing to an enemy armed with small bucklers and unwieldy weapons
 nam Britannorum gladii sine mucrone complexum armorum et in arto pugnam non tolerabant$$ The swords of the Britons are not pointed ,  and do not allow them to close with the foe ,  or to fight in the open field
 Igitur ut Batavi miscere ictus , ferire umbonibus , ora fodere , et stratis qui in aequo adstiterant , erigere in collis aciem coepere , ceterae cohortes aemulatione et impetu conisae proximos quosque caedere$$ No sooner did the Batavians begin to close with the enemy ,  to strike them with their shields ,  to disfigure their faces ,  and overthrowing the force on the plain to advance their line up the hill ,  than the other auxiliary cohorts joined with eager rivalry in cutting down all the nearest of the foe
 ac plerique semineces aut integri festinatione victoriae relinquebantur$$ Many were left behind half dead ,  some even unwounded ,  in the hurry of victory
 Interim equitum turmae , ut fugere covinnarii , peditum se proelio miscuere$$ Meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled ,  and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry
 Et quamquam recentem terrorem intulerant , densis tamen hostium agminibus et inaequalibus locis haerebant$$ But although these at first spread panic ,  they were soon impeded by the close array of our ranks and by the inequalities of the ground
 minimeque aequa nostris iam pugnae facies erat , cum aegre clivo instantes simul equorum corporibus impellerentur ac saepe vagi currus , exterriti sine rectoribus equi , ut quemque formido tulerat , transversos aut obvios incursabant$$ The battle had anything but the appearance of a cavalry action ,  for men and horses were carried along in confusion together ,  while chariots ,  destitute of guidance ,  and terrified horses without drivers ,  dashed as panic urged them ,  sideways ,  or in direct collision against the ranks
 Et Britanni , qui adhuc pugnae expertes summa collium insederant et paucitatem nostrorum vacui spernebant , degredi paulatim et circumire terga vincentium coeperant , ni id ipsum veritus Agricola quattuor equitum alas , ad subita belli retentas , venientibus opposuisset , quantoque ferocius adcucurrerant , tanto acrius pulsos in fugam disiecisset$$ Those of the Britons who ,  having as yet taken no part in the engagement ,  occupied the hill-tops ,  and who without fear for themselves sat idly disdaining the smallness of our numbers ,  had begun gradually to descend and to hem in the rear of the victorious army ,  when Agricola ,  who feared this very movement ,  opposed their advance with four squadrons of cavalry held in reserve by him for any sudden emergencies of battle
 Ita consilium Britannorum in ipsos versum , transvectaeque praecepto ducis a fronte pugnantium alae aversam hostium aciem invasere$$ Their repulse and rout was as severe as their onset had been furious Thus the enemy's design recoiled on himself ,  and the cavalry which by the general's order had wheeled round from the van of the contending armies ,  attacked his rear
 Tum vero patentibus locis grande et atrox spectaculum$$ Then ,  indeed ,  the open plain presented an awful and hideous spectacle
 sequi , vulnerare , capere , atque eosdem oblatis aliis trucidare$$ Our men pursued ,  wounded ,  made prisoners of the fugitives only to slaughter them when others fell in their way
 Iam hostium , prout cuique ingenium erat , catervae armatorum paucioribus terga praestare , quidam inermes ultro ruere ac se morti offerre$$ And now the enemy ,  as prompted by their various dispositions ,  fled in whole battalions with arms in their hands before a few pursuers ,  while some ,  who were unarmed ,  actually rushed to the front and gave themselves up to death
 Passim arma et corpora et laceri artus et cruenta humus$$ Everywhere there lay scattered arms ,  corpses ,  and mangled limbs ,  and the earth reeked with blood
 et aliquando etiam victis ira virtusque$$ Even the conquered now and then felt a touch of fury and of courage
 Nam postquam silvis adpropinquaverunt , primos sequentium incautos collecti et locorum gnari circumveniebant$$ On approaching the woods ,  they rallied ,  and its they knew the ground ,  they were able to pounce on the foremost and least cautious of the pursuers
 Quod ni frequens ubique Agricola validas et expeditas cohortis indaginis modo et , sicubi artiora erant , partem equitum dimissis equis , simul rariores silvas equitem persultare iussisset , acceptum aliquod vulnus per nimiam fiduciam foret$$ Had not Agricola ,  who was present everywhere ,  ordered a force of strong and lightly-equipped cohorts ,  with some dismounted troopers for the denser parts of the forest ,  and a detachment of cavalry where it was not so thick ,  to scour the woods like a party of huntsmen ,  serious loss would have been sustained through the excessive confidence of our troops
 Ceterum ubi compositos firmis ordinibus sequi rursus videre , in fugam versi , non agminibus , ut prius , nec alius alium respectantes$$ When ,  however ,  the enemy saw that we again pursued them in firm and compact array ,  they fled no longer in masses as before ,  each looking for his comrade
 rari e vitabundi in vicem longinqua atque avia petiere$$ but dispersing and avoiding one another ,  they sought the shelter of distant and pathless wilds
 Finis sequendi nox et satietas fuit$$ Night and weariness of bloodshed put an end to the pursuit
 Caesa hostium ad decem milia$$ About 10 , 000 of the enemy were slain
 nostrorum trecenti sexaginta cecidere , in quis Aulus Atticus praefectus cohortis , iuvenili ardore et ferocia equi hostibus inlatus$$ on our side there fell 360 men ,  and among them Aulus Atticus ,  the commander of the cohort ,  whose youthful impetuosity and mettlesome steed had borne him into the midst of the enemy
 Et nox quidem gaudio praedaque laeta victoribus$$ Elated by their victory and their booty ,  the conquerors passed a night of merriment
 Britanni palantes mixto virorum mulierumque ploratu trahere vulneratos , vocare integros , deserere domos ac per iram ultro incendere , eligere latebras et statim relinquere$$ Meanwhile the Britons ,  wandering amidst the mingled wailings of men and women ,  were dragging off their wounded ,  calling to the unhurt ,  deserting their homes ,  and in their rage actually firing them ,  choosing places of concealment only instantly to abandon them
 miscere in vicem consilia aliqua , dein separare aliquando frangi aspectu pignorum suorum , saepius concitari$$ One moment they would take counsel together ,  the next ,  part company ,  while the sight of those who were dearest to them sometimes melted their hearts ,  but oftener roused their fury
 Satisque constabat saevisse quosdam in coniuges ac liberos , tamquam misererentur$$ It was an undoubted fact that some of them vented their rage on their wives and children ,  as if in pity for their lot
 Proximus dies faciem victoriae latius aperuit$$ The following day showed more fully the extent of the calamity ,  for the silence of desolation reigned everywhere 
 vastum ubique silentium , secreti colles , fumantia procul tecta , nemo exploratoribus obvius$$  the hills were forsaken ,  houses were smoking in the distance ,  and no one was seen by the scouts
 Quibus in omnem partem dimissis , ubi incerta fugae vestigia neque usquam conglobari hostis compertum (et exacta iam aestate spargi bellum nequibat) , in finis Borestorum exercitum deducit$$ These were despatched in all directions and it having been ascertained that the track of the flying enemy was uncertain ,  and that there was no attempt at rallying ,  it being also impossible ,  as summer was now over ,  to extend the war ,  Agricola led back his army into the territory of the Boresti
 Ibi acceptis obsidibus , praefecto classis circumvehi Britanniam praecipit$$ He received hostages from them ,  and then ordered the commander of the fleet to sail round Britain
 Datae ad id vires , et praecesserat terror$$ A force for this purpose was given him ,  which great panic everywhere preceded
 Ipse peditem atque equites lento itinere , quo novarum gentium animi ipsa transitus mora terrerentur , in hibernis locavit Et simul classis secunda tempestate ac fama Trucculensem portum tenuit , unde proximo Britanniae latere praelecto omni redierat$$ Agricola himself ,  leading his infantry and cavalry by slow marches ,  so as to overawe the newly-conquered tribes by the very tardiness of his progress ,  brought them into winter-quarters ,  while the fleet with propitious breezes and great renown entered the harbour of Trutulium ,  to which it had returned after having coasted along the entire southern shore of the island
 Hunc rerum cursum , quamquam nulla verborum iactantia epistulis Agricolae auctum , ut erat Domitiano moris , fronte laetus , pectore anxius excepit$$ Of this series of events ,  though not exaggerated in the despatches of Agricola by any boastfulness of language ,  Domitian heard ,  as was his wont ,  with joy in his face but anxiety in his heart
 Inerat conscientia derisui fuisse nuper falsum e Germania triumphum , emptis per commercia , quorum habitus et crinis in captivorum speciem formarentur at nunc veram magnamque victoriam tot milibus hostium caesis ingenti fama celebrari$$ He felt conscious that all men laughed at his late mock triumph over Germany ,  for which there had been purchased from traders people whose dress and hair might be made to resemble those of captives ,  whereas now a real and splendid victory ,  with the destruction of thousands of the enemy ,  was being celebrated with just applause
 Id sibi maxime formidolosum , privati hominis nomen supra principem attolli$$ It was ,  he thought ,  a very alarming thing for him that the name of a subject should be raised above that of the Emperor
 frustra studia fori et civilium artium decus in silentium acta , si militarem gloriam alius occuparet$$ it was to no purpose that he had driven into obscurity the pursuit of forensic eloquence and the graceful accomplishments of civil life ,  if another were to forestall the distinctions of war
 cetera utcumque facilius dissimulari , ducis boni imperatoriam virtutem esse$$ To other glories he could more easily shut his eyes ,  but the greatness of a good general was a truly imperial quality
 Talibus curis exercitus , quodque saevae cogitationis indicium erat , secreto suo satiatus , optimum in praesentia statuit reponere odium , donec impetus famae et favor exercitus languesceret$$ Harassed by these anxieties ,  and absorbed in an incommunicable trouble ,  a sure prognostic of some cruel purpose ,  he decided that it was best for the present to suspend his hatred until the freshness of Agricola's renown and his popularity with the army should begin to pass away
 Igitur triumphalia ornamenta et inlustris statuae honorem et quidquid pro triumpho datur , multo verborum honore cumulata , decerni in senatu iubet addique insuper opinionem , Syriam provinciam Agricolae destinari , vacuam tum morte Atili Rufi consularis et maioribus reservatam Credidere plerique libertum ex secretioribus ministeriis missum ad Agricolam codicillos , quibus ei Syria dabatur , tulisse , cum eo praecepto ut , si in Britannia foret , traderentur eumque libertum in ipso freto Oceani obvium Agricolae , ne appellato quidem eo ad Domitianum remeasse , sive verum istud , sive ex ingenio principis fictum ac compositum est$$ For Agricola was still the governor of Britain Accordingly the Emperor ordered that the usual triumphal decorations ,  the honour of a laurelled statue ,  and all that is commonly given in place of the triumphal procession ,  with the addition of many laudatory expressions ,  should be decreed in the senate ,  together with a hint to the effect that Agricola was to have the province of Syria ,  then vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus ,  a man of consular rank ,  and generally reserved for men of distinction
 Tradiderat interim Agricola successori suo provinciam quietam tutamque Ac ne notabilis celebritate et frequentia occurrentium introitus esset , vitato amicorum officio noctu in urbem , noctu in Palatium , ita ut praeceptum erat , venit exceptusque brevi osculo et nullo sermone turbae servientium inmixtus est$$ It was believed by many persons that one of the freedmen employed on confidential services was sent to Agricola ,  bearing a despatch in which Syria was offered him ,  and with instructions to deliver it should he be in Britain
 Ceterum uti militare nomen , grave inter otiosos , aliis virtutibus temperaret , tranquillitatem atque otium penitus hausit , cultu modicus , sermone facilis , uno aut altero amicorum comitatus , adeo ut plerique , quibus magnos viros per ambitionem aestimare mos est , viso aspectoque Agricola quaererent famam , pauci interpretarentur$$ that this freedman in crossing the straits met Agricola ,  and without even saluting him made his way back to Domitian though I cannot say whether the story is true ,  or is only a fiction invented to suit the Emperor's character
 Aderat iam annus , quo proconsulatum Africae et Asiae sortiretur , et occiso Civica nuper nec Agricolae consilium deerat nec Domitiano exemplum$$ The year had now arrived in which the proconsulate of Asia or Africa was to fall to him by lot ,  and ,  as Civica had been lately murdered ,  Agricola did not want a warning ,  or Domitian a precedent
 Accessere quidam cogitationum principis periti , qui iturusne esset in provinciam ultro Agricolam interrogarent$$ Persons well acquainted with the Emperor's feelings came to ask Agricola ,  as if on their own account ,  whether he would go
 Ac primo occultius quietem et otium laudare , mox operam suam in adprobanda excusatione offerre , postremo non iam obscuri suadentes simul terrentesque pertraxere ad Domitianum$$ First they hinted their purpose by praises of tranquillity and leisure then offered their services in procuring acceptance for his excuses and at last ,  throwing off all disguise ,  brought him by entreaties and threats to Domitian
 Qui paratus simulatione , in adrogantiam compositus , et audiit preces excusantis , et , cum adnuisset , agi sibi gratias passus est , nec erubuit beneficii invidia$$ The Emperor ,  armed beforehand with hypocrisy ,  and assuming a haughty demeanour ,  listened to his prayer that he might be excused ,  and having granted his request allowed himself to be formally thanked ,  nor blushed to grant so sinister a favour
 Salarium tamen proconsulare solitum offerri et quibusdam a se ipso concessum Agricolae non dedit , sive offensus non petitum , sive ex conscientia , ne quod vetuerat videretur emisse$$ But the salary usually granted to a proconsul ,  and which he had himself given to some governors ,  he did not bestow on Agricola ,  either because he was offended at its not having been asked ,  or was warned by his conscience that he might be thought to have purchased the refusal which he had commanded
 Proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem laeseris$$ It is ,  indeed ,  human nature to hate the man whom you have injured
 Domitiani vero natura praeceps in iram , et quo obscurior , eo inrevocabilior , moderatione tamen prudentiaque Agricolae leniebatur , quia non contumacia neque inani iactatione libertatis famam fatumque provocabat$$ yet the Emperor ,  notwithstanding his irascible temper and an implacability proportioned to his reserve ,  was softened by the moderation and prudence of Agricola ,  who neither by a perverse obstinacy nor an idle parade of freedom challenged fame or provoked his fate
 Sciant , quibus moris est inlicita mirari , posse etiam sub malis principibus magnos viros esse , obsequiumque ac modestiam , si industria ac vigor adsint , eo laudis excedere , quo plerique per abrupta , sed in nullum rei publicae usum <nisi> ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt$$ Let it be known to those whose habit it is to admire the disregard of authority ,  that there may be great men even under bad emperors ,  and that obedience and submission ,  when joined to activity and vigour ,  may attain a glory which most men reach only by a perilous career ,  utterly useless to the state ,  and closed by an ostentatious death
 Finis vitae eius nobis luctuosus , amicis tristis , extraneis etiam ignotisque non sine cura fuit$$ The end of his life ,  a deplorable calamity to us and a grief to his friends ,  was regarded with concern even by strangers and those who knew him not
 vulgus quoque et hic aliud agens populus et ventitavere ad domum et per fora et circulos locuti sunt$$ The common people and this busy population continually inquired at his house ,  and talked of him in public places and in private gatherings
 nec quisquam audita morte Agricolae aut laetatus est aut statim oblitus$$ No man when he heard of Agricola's death could either be glad or at once forget it
 Augebat miserationem constans rumor veneno interceptum$$ Men's sympathy was increased by a prevalent rumour that he was destroyed by poison
 nobis nihil comperti , ut adfirmare ausim$$ For myself ,  I have nothing which I should venture to state for fact
 Ceterum per omnem valetudinem eius crebrius quam ex more principatus per nuntios visentis et libertorum primi et medicorum intimi venere , sive cura illud sive inquisitio erat$$ Certainly during the whole of his illness the Emperor's chief freedmen and confidential physicians came more frequently than is usual with a court which pays its visits by means of messengers
 Supremo quidem die momenta ipsa deficientis per dispositos cursores nuntiata constabat , nullo credente sic adcelerari quae tristis audiret$$ This was ,  perhaps ,  solicitude ,  perhaps espionage Certain it is ,  that on the last day the very agonies of his dying moments were reported by a succession of couriers ,  and no one believed that there would be such haste about tidings which would be heard with regret
 Speciem tamen doloris animi vultu prae se tulit , securus iam odii et qui facilius dissimularet gaudium quam metum$$ Yet in his manner and countenance the Emperor displayed some signs of sorrow ,  for he could now forget his enmity ,  and it was easier to conceal his joy than his fear
 Satis constabat lecto testamento Agricolae , quo coheredem optimae uxori et piissimae filiae Domitianum scripsit , laetatum eum velut honore iudicioque$$ It was well known that on reading the will ,  in which he was named co-heir with Agricola's excellent wife and most dutiful daughter ,  he expressed delight ,  as if it had been a complimentary choice
 Tam caeca et corrupta mens adsiduis adulationibus erat , ut nesciret a bono patre non scribi heredem nisi malum principem$$ So blinded and perverted was his mind by incessant flattery ,  that he did not know that it was only a bad Emperor whom a good father would make his heir
 Natus erat Agricola Gaio Caesare tertium consule idibus Iuniis$$ Agricola was born on the 13th of June ,  in the third consulate of Caius Cæsar
 excessit quarto et quinquagesimo anno , decimum kalendas Septembris Collega Prisc<in>oque consulibus$$ he died on the 23rd of August ,  during the consulate of Collega and Priscus ,  being in the fifty-sixth year of his age
 Quod si habitum quoque eius posteri noscere velint , decentior quam sublimior fuit$$ Should posterity wish to know something of his appearance ,  it was graceful rather than commanding
 nihil impetus in vultu$$ There was nothing formidable in his appearance
 gratia oris supererat$$ a gracious look predominated
 Bonum virum facile crederes , magnum libenter$$ One would easily believe him a good man ,  and willingly believe him to be great
 Et ipse quidem , quamquam medio in spatio integrae aetatis ereptus , quantum ad gloriam , longissimum aevum peregit$$ As for himself ,  though taken from us in the prime of a vigorous manhood ,  yet ,  as far as glory is concerned ,  his life was of the longest
 Quippe et vera bona , quae in virtutibus sita sunt , impleverat , et consulari ac triumphalibus ornamentis praedito quid aliud adstruere fortuna poterat$$ Those true blessings ,  indeed ,  which consist in virtue ,  he had fully attained and on one who had reached the honours of a consulate and a triumph ,  what more had fortune to bestow
 Opibus nimiis non gaudebat , speciosae non contigerant$$ Immense wealth had no attractions for him ,  and wealth he had ,  even to splendour
 Filia atque uxore superstitibus potest videri etiam beatus incolumi dignitate , florente fama , salvis adfinitatibus et amicitiis futura effugisse$$ As his daughter and his wife survived him ,  it may be thought that he was even fortunate fortunate ,  in that while his honours had suffered no eclipse ,  while his fame was at its height ,  while his kindred and his friends still prospered ,  he escaped from the evil to come
 Nam sicut ei non licuit durare in hanc beatissimi saeculi lucem ac principem Traianum videre , quod augurio votisque apud nostras auris ominabatur , ita festinatae mortis grande solacium tulit evasisse postremum illud tempus , quo Domitianus non iam per intervalla ac spiramenta temporum , sed continuo et velut uno ictu rem publicam exhausit$$ For ,  though to survive until the dawn of this most happy age and to see a Trajan on the throne was what he would speculate upon in previsions and wishes confided to my ears ,  yet he had this mighty compensation for his premature death ,  that he was spared those later years during which Domitian ,  leaving now no interval or breathing space of time ,  but ,  as it were ,  with one continuous blow ,  drained the life-blood of the Commonwealth
 Non vidit Agricola obsessam curiam et clausum armis senatum et eadem strage tot consularium caedes , tot nobilissimarum feminarum exilia et fugas Una adhuc victoria Carus Mettius censebatur , et intra Albanam arcem sententia Messalini strepebat , et Massa Baebius iam tum reus erat$$ Agricola did not see the senate-house besieged ,  or the senate hemmed in by armed men ,  or so many of our consulars falling at one single massacre ,  or so many of Rome's noblest ladies exiles and fugitives
 mox nostrae duxere Helvidium in carcerem manus nos Maurici Rusticique visus foedavit nos innocenti sanguine Senecio perfudit Nero tamen subtraxit oculos suos iussitque scelera , non spectavit praecipua sub Domitiano miseriarum pars erat videre et aspici , cum suspiria nostra subscriberentur , cum denotandis tot hominum palloribus sufficeret saevus ille vultus et rubor , quo se contra pudorem muniebat Tu vero felix , Agricola , non vitae tantum claritate , sed etiam opportunitate mortis Ut perhibent qui interfuere novissimis sermonibus tuis , constans et libens fatum excepisti , tamquam pro virili portione innocentiam principi donares$$ Carus Metius had as yet the distinction of but one victory ,  and the noisy counsels of Messalinus were not heard beyond the walls of Alba ,  and Massa Bæbius was then answering for his life It was not long before our hands dragged Helvidius to prison ,  before we gazed on the dying looks of Manricus and Rusticus ,  before we were steeped in Senecio's innocent blood
 Sed mihi filiaeque eius praeter acerbitatem parentis erepti auget maestitiam , quod adsidere valetudini , fovere deficientem , satiari vultu complexuque non contigit$$ Even Nero turned his eyes away ,  and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered
 Excepissemus certe mandata vocesque , quas penitus animo figeremus Noster hic dolor , nostrum vulnus , nobis tam longae absentiae condicione ante quadriennium amissus est Omnia sine dubio , optime parentum , adsidente amantissima uxore superfuere honori tuo paucioribus tamen lacrimis comploratus es , et novissima in luce desideravere aliquid oculi tui$$ with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen ,  to know that our sighs were being recorded ,  to have ,  ever ready to note the pallid looks of so many faces ,  that savage countenance reddened with the hue with which he defied shame
 Si quis piorum manibus locus , si , ut sapientibus placet , non cum corpore extinguuntur magnae animae , placide quiescas , nosque domum tuam ab infirmo desiderio et muliebribus lamentis ad contemplationem virtutum tuarum voces , quas neque lugeri neque plangi fas est$$ If there is any dwelling-place for the spirits of the just if ,  as the wise believe ,  noble souls do not perish with the body ,  rest thou in peace and call us ,  thy family ,  from weak regrets and womanish laments to the contemplation of thy virtues ,  for which we must not weep nor beat the breast
 Admiratione te potius et immortalibus laudibus et , si natura suppeditet , similitudine colamus$$ Let us honour thee not so much with transitory praises as with our reverence ,  and ,  if our powers permit us ,  with our emulation
 is verus honos , ea coniunctissimi cuiusque pietas$$ That will be true respect ,  that the true affection of thy nearest kin
 Id filiae quoque uxorique praeceperim , sic patris , sic mariti memoriam venerari , ut omnia facta dictaque eius secum revolvant , formamque ac figuram animi magis quam corporis complectantur , non quia intercedendum putem imaginibus quae marmore aut aere finguntur , sed ut vultus hominum , ita simulacra vultus imbecilla ac mortalia sunt , forma mentis aeterna , quam tenere et exprimere non per alienam materiam et artem , sed tuis ipse moribus possis$$ This ,  too ,  is what I would enjoin on daughter and wife ,  to honour the memory of that father ,  that husband ,  by pondering in their hearts all his words and acts ,  by cherishing the features and lineaments of his character rather than those of his person It is not that I would forbid the likenesses which are wrought in marble or in bronze but as the faces of men ,  so all similitudes of the face are weak and perishable things ,  while the fashion of the soul is everlasting ,  such as may be expressed not in some foreign substance ,  or by the help of art ,  but in our own lives
 Quidquid ex Agricola amavimus , quidquid mirati sumus , manet mansurumque est in animis hominum in aeternitae temporum , fama rerum$$ Whatever we loved ,  whatever we admired in Agricola ,  survives ,  and will survive in the hearts of men ,  in the succession of the ages ,  in the fame that waits on noble deeds
 nam multos veterum velut inglorios et ignobilis oblivio obruit$$ Over many indeed ,  of those who have gone before ,  as over the inglorious and ignoble ,  the waves of oblivion will roll
 Agricola posteritati narratus et traditus superstes erit$$ Agricola ,  made known to posterity by history and tradition ,  will live for ever
 Saepe ex me requiris , Iuste Fabi , cur , cum priora saecula tot eminentium oratorum ingeniis gloriaque floruerint , nostra potissimum aetas deserta et laude eloquentiae orbata vix nomen ipsum oratoris retineat$$ You often ask me ,  Justus Fabius ,  how it is that while the genius and the fame of so many distinguished orators have shed a lustre on the past ,  our age is so forlorn and so destitute of the glory of eloquence that it scarce retains the very name of orator
 neque enim ita appellamus nisi antiquos , horum autem temporum diserti causidici et advocati et patroni et quidvis potius quam oratores vocantur$$ That title indeed we apply only to the ancients ,  and the clever speakers of this day we call pleaders ,  advocates ,  counsellors ,  anything rather than orators
 Cui percontationi tuae respondere et tam magnae quaestionis pondus excipere , ut aut de ingeniis nostris male existimandum sit , si idem adsequi non possumus , aut de iudiciis , si nolumus , vix hercule auderem , si mihi mea sententia proferenda ac non disertissimorum , ut nostris temporibus , hominum sermo repetendus esset , quos eandem hanc quaestionem pertractantis iuvenis admodum audivi$$ To answer this question of yours ,  to undertake the burden of so serious an inquiry ,  involving ,  as it must ,  a mean opinion either of our capacities ,  if we cannot reach the same standard ,  or of our tastes ,  if we have not the wish ,  is a task on which I should scarcely venture had I to give my own views instead of being able to reproduce a conversation among men ,  for our time ,  singularly eloquent ,  whom ,  when quite a youth ,  I heard discussing this very question
 Ita non ingenio , sed memoria et recordatione opus est , ut quae a praestantissimis viris et excogitata subtiliter et dicta graviter accepi , cum singuli diversas vel easdem sed probabilis causas adferrent , dum formam sui quisque et animi et ingenii redderent , isdem nunc numeris isdemque rationibus persequar , servato ordine disputationis$$ And so it is not ability ,  it is only memory and recollection which I require I have to repeat now ,  with the same divisions and arguments ,  following closely the course of that discussion ,  those subtle reflections which I heard ,  powerfully expressed ,  from men of the highest eminence ,  each of whom assigned a different but plausible reason ,  thereby displaying the peculiarities of his individual temper and genius
 Neque enim defuit qui diversam quoque partem susciperet , ac multum vexata et inrisa vetustate nostrorum temporum eloquentiam antiquorum ingeniis anteferret$$ Nor indeed did the opposite side lack an advocate ,  who ,  after much criticism and ridicule of old times ,  maintained the superiority of the eloquence of our own days to the great orators of the past
 Nam postero die quam Curiatius Maternus Catonem recitaverat , cum offendisse potentium animos diceretur , tamquam in eo tragoediae argumento sui oblitus tantum Catonem cogitasset , eaque de re per urbem frequens sermo haberetur , venerunt ad eum Marcus Aper et Iulius Secundus , celeberrima tum ingenia fori nostri , quos ego utrosque non modo in iudiciis studiose audiebam , sed domi quoque et in publico adsectabar mira studiorum cupiditate et quodam ardore iuvenili , ut fabulas quoque eorum et disputationes et arcana semotae dictionis penitus exciperem , quamvis maligne plerique opinarentur , nec Secundo promptum esse sermonem et Aprum ingenio potius et vi naturae quam institutione et litteris famam eloquentiae consecutum$$ It was the day after Curiatius Maternus had given a reading of his Cato ,  by which it was said that he had irritated the feelings of certain great personages ,  because in the subject of his tragedy he had apparently forgotten himself and thought only of Cato While all Rome was discussing the subject ,  he received a visit from Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus ,  then the most famous men of genius at our bar Of both I was a studious hearer in court ,  and I also would follow them to their homes and when they appeared in public ,  from a singular zeal for my profession ,  and a youthful enthusiasm which urged me to listen diligently to their trivial talk ,  their more serious debates ,  and their private and esoteric descourse Yet many ill-naturedly thought that Secundus had no readiness of speech ,  and that Aper had won his reputation for eloquence by his cleverness and natural powers ,  more than by training and culture
 Nam et Secundo purus et pressus et , in quantum satis erat , profluens sermo non defuit , et Aper omni eruditione imbutus contemnebat potius litteras quam nesciebat , tamquam maiorem industriae et laboris gloriam habiturus , si ingenium eius nullis alienarum artium adminiculis inniti videretur$$ As a fact ,  Secundus had a pure ,  terse ,  and a sufficiently fluent style ,  while Aper ,  who was imbued with learning of all kinds ,  pretended to despise the culture which he really possessed He would have ,  so he must have thought ,  a greater reputation for industry and application ,  if it should appear that his genius did not depend on any supports from pursuits alien to his profession
 Igitur ut intravimus cubiculum Materni , sedentem ipsumque , quem pridie recitaverat librum , inter manus habentem deprehendimus Tum Secundus nihilne te inquit , Materne , fabulae malignorum terrent , quo minus offensas Catonis tui ames An ideo librum istum adprehendisti , ut diligentius retractares , et sublatis si qua pravae interpretationi materiam dederunt , emitteres Catonem non quidem meliorem , sed tamen securiorem Tum ille leges inquit quid Maternus sibi debuerit , et adgnosces quae audisti Quod si qua omisit Cato , sequenti recitatione Thyestes dicet hanc enim tragoediam disposui iam et intra me ipse formavi$$ So we entered the study of Maternus ,  and found him seated with the very book which he had read the day before ,  in his hands Secundus began Has the talk of ill-natured people no effect in deterring you ,  Maternus ,  from clinging to your Cato with its provocations
 Atque ideo maturare libri huius editionem festino , ut dimissa priore cura novae cogitationi toto pectore incumbam Adeo te tragoediae istae non satiant , inquit Aper quo minus omissis orationum et causarum studiis omne tempus modo circa Medeam , ecce nunc circa Thyestem consumas , cum te tot amicorum causae , tot coloniarum et municipiorum clientelae in forum vocent , quibus vix suffeceris , etiam si non novum tibi ipse negotium importasses , ut Domitium et Catonem , id est nostras quoque historias et Romana nomina Graeculorum fabulis adgregares$$ Or have you taken up the book to revise it more carefully ,  and ,  after striking out whatever has given a handle for a bad interpretation ,  will you publish ,  if not a better ,  at least a safer ,  Cato
 Et Maternus perturbarer hac tua severitate , nisi frequens et assidua nobis contentio iam prope in consuetudinem vertisset$$ This severity of yours ,  replied Maternus ,  would be quite a blow to us ,  had not our controversy from its frequency and familiarity become by this time almost a regular practice
 Nam nec tu agitare et insequi poetas intermittis , et ego , cui desidiam advocationum obicis , cotidianum hoc patrocinium defendendae adversus te poeticae exerceo$$ You ,  in fact ,  never cease from abusing and inveighing against poets ,  and I ,  whom you reproach with neglect of my professional duties ,  every day undertake to plead against you in defence of poetry
 Quo laetor magis oblatum nobis iudicem , qui me vel in futurum vetet versus facere , vel , quod iam pridem opto , sua quoque auctoritate compellat , ut omissis forensium causarum angustiis , in quibus mihi satis superque sudatum est , sanctiorem illam et augustiorem eloquentiam colam$$ So I am all the more delighted at the presence of a judge who will either forbid me for the future to write verses ,  or who will compel me by his additional authority to do what I have long desired ,  to give up the petty subleties of legal causes ,  at which I have toiled enough ,  and more than enough ,  and to cultivate a more sacred and more stately eloquence
 Ego vero inquit Secundus , antequam me iudicem Aper recuset , faciam quod probi et moderati iudices solent , ut in iis cognitionibus se excusent , in quibus manifestum est alteram apud eos partem gratia praevalere Quis enim nescit neminem mihi coniunctiorem esse et usu amicitiae et assiduitate contubernii quam Saleium Bassum , cum optimum virum tum absolutissimum poetam Porro si poetica accusatur , non alium video reum locupletiorem Securus sit inquit Aper et Saleius Bassus et quisquis alius studium poeticae et carminum gloriam fovet , cum causas agere non possit Ego enim , quatenus arbitrum litis huius inveniri , non patiar Maternum societate plurium defendi , sed ipsum solum apud omnes arguam , quod natus ad eloquentiam virilem et oratoriam , qua parere simul et tueri amicitias , adsciscere necessitudines , complecti provincias possit , omittit studium , quo non aliud in civitate nostra vel ad utilitatem fructuosius vel ad voluptatem dulcius vel ad dignitatem amplius vel ad urbis famam pulchrius vel ad totius imperii atque omnium gentium notitiam inlustrius excogitari potest Nam si ad utilitatem vitae omnia consilia factaque nostra derigenda sunt , quid est tutius quam eam exercere artem , qua semper armatus praesidium amicis , opem alienis , salutem periclitantibus , invidis vero et inimicis metum et terrorem ultro feras , ipse securus et velut quadam perpetua potentia ac potestate munitus cuius vis et utilitas rebus prospere fluentibus aliorum perfugio et tutela intellegitur sin proprium periculum increpuit , non hercule lorica et gladius in acie firmius munimentum quam reo et periclitanti eloquentia , praesidium simul ac telum , quo propugnare pariter et incessere sive in iudicio sive in senatu sive apud principem possis$$ For my part ,  said Secundus ,  before Aper refuses me as a judge ,  I will do as is usually done by upright and sensible judges ,  who excuse themselves in cases in which it is evident that one side has an undue influence with them Who knows not that no one is nearer my heart from long friendship and uninterrupted intercourse than Saleius Bassus ,  an excellent man ,  as well as a most accomplished poet
 Quid aliud infestis patribus nuper Eprius Marcellus quam eloquentiam suam opposuit Qua accinctus et minax disertam quidem , sed inexercitatam et eius modi certaminum rudem Helvidii sapientiam elusit plura de utilitate non dico , cui parti minime contra dicturum Maternum meum arbitror$$ Besides ,  if poetry is to be put on her defence ,  I know not a more influential defendant
 Ad voluptatem oratoriae eloquentiae transeo , cuius iucunditas non uno aliquo momento , sed omnibus prope diebus ac prope omnibus horis contingit$$ I pass now to the pleasure derived from the orator's eloquence Its delights are enjoyed not for a single moment ,  but almost on every day and at every hour
 Quid enim dulcius libero et ingenuo animo et ad voluptates honestas nato quam videre plenam semper et frequentem domum suam concursu splendidissimorum hominum idque scire non pecuniae , non orbitati , non officii alicuius administrationi , sed sibi ipsi dari$$ To the mind of an educated gentleman ,  naturally fitted for worthy enjoyments ,  what can be more delightful than to see his house always thronged and crowded by gatherings of the most eminent men ,  and to know that the honour is paid not to his wealth ,  his childlessness ,  or his possession of some office ,  but to himself
 ipsos quin immo orbos et locupletes et potentis venire plerumque ad iuvenem et pauperem , ut aut sua aut amicorum discrimina commendent$$ Nay ,  more the childless ,  the rich ,  and the powerful often go to one who is both young and poor ,  in order to intrust him with difficulties affecting themselves or their friends
 ullane tanta ingentium opum ac magnae potentiae voluptas quam spectare homines veteres et senes et totius orbis gratia subnixos in summa rerum omnium abundantia confitentis , id quod optimum sit se non habere$$ Can there be any pleasure from boundless wealth and vast power equal to that of seeing men in years ,  and even in old age ,  men backed by the influence of the whole world ,  readily confessing ,  amid the utmost affluence of every kind ,  that they do not possess that which is the best of all
 iam vero qui togatorum comitatus et egressus! Quae in publico species! Quae in iudiciis veneratio! Quod illud gaudium consurgendi adsistendique inter tacentis et in unum conversos! coire populum et circumfundi coram et accipere adfectum , quemcumque orator induerit! vulgata dicentium gaudia et imperitorum quoque oculis exposita percenseo$$ Again ,  look at the respectable citizens who escort the pleader to and from the court Look at his appearance in public ,  and the respect shown him before the judges What a delight it must be to rise and stand amid the hushed crowd ,  with every eye on him alone ,  the people assembling and gathering round him in a circle ,  and taking from the orator any emotion he has himself assumed
 illa secretiora et tantum ipsis orantibus nota maiora sunt$$ I am now reckoning the notorious joys of an orator ,  those which are open to the sight even of the uneducated
 Sive accuratam meditatamque profert orationem , est quoddam sicut ipsius dictionis , ita gaudii pondus et constantia$$ the more secret ,  known only to the advocate himself ,  are yet greater
 sive novam et recentem curam non sine aliqua trepidatione animi attulerit , ipsa sollicitudo commendat eventum et lenocinatur voluptati$$ If he produces a careful and well-prepared speech ,  there is a solidity and stedfastness in his satisfaction ,  just as there is in his style
 Sed extemporalis audaciae atque ipsius temeritatis vel praecipua iucunditas est$$ if ,  again ,  he offers his audience ,  not without some tremblings at heart ,  the result of a fresh and sudden effort ,  his very anxiety enhances the joy of success ,  and ministers to his pleasure
 nam in ingenio quoque , sicut in agro , quamquam grata sint quae diu serantur atque elaborentur , gratiora tamen quae sua sponte nascuntur$$ In fact ,  audacity at the moment ,  and rashness itself ,  have quite a peculiar sweetness
 Equidem , ut de me ipso fatear , non eum diem laetiorem egi , quo mihi latus clavus oblatus est , vel quo homo novus et in civitate minime favorabili natus quaesturam aut tribunatum aut praeturam accepi , quam eos , quibus mihi pro mediocritate huius quantulaecumque in dicendo facultatis aut reum prospere defendere aut apud centumviros causam aliquam feliciter orare aut apud principem ipsos illos libertos et procuratores principum tueri et defendere datur$$ To speak my own mind ,  I did not experience more job on the day on which I was presented with the robe of a senator ,  or when ,  as a new man ,  born in a far from influential state ,  I was elected quæstor ,  or tribune ,  or prætor ,  than on those on which it was my privilege ,  considering the insignificance of my ability as a speaker ,  to defend a prisoner with success ,  to win a verdict in a cause before the Court of the Hundred ,  or to give the support of my advocacy in the emperor's presence to the great freedmen themselves ,  or to ministers of the crown
 tum mihi supra tribunatus et praeturas et consulatus ascendere videor , tum habere quod , si non ultro oritur , nec codicillis datur nec cum gratia venit$$ On such occasions I seem to rise above tribunates ,  prætorships ,  and consulships ,  and to possess that which ,  if it be not of natural growth ,  is not bestowed by mandate ,  nor comes through interest
 Quid fama et laus cuius artis cum oratorum gloria comparanda est Quid Non inlustres sunt in urbe non solum apud negotiosos et rebus intentos , sed etiam apud iuvenes vacuos et adulescentis , quibus modo recta indoles est et bona spes sui$$ Again ,  is there an accomplishment ,  the fame and glory of which are to be compared with the distinction of the orator ,  who is an illustrious man at Rome ,  not only with the busy class ,  intent on public affairs ,  but even with people of leisure ,  and with the young ,  those at least who have a right disposition and a worthy confidence in themselves
 Quorum nomina prius parentes liberis suis ingerunt$$ Whose name does the father din into his children's ears before that of the orator
 Quos saepius vulgus quoque imperitum et tunicatus hic populus transeuntis nomine vocat et digito demonstrat$$ Whom ,  as he passes by ,  do the ignorant mob and the men with the tunic oftener speak of by name and point out with the finger
 Advenae quoque et peregrini iam in municipiis et coloniis suis auditos , cum primum urbem attigerunt , requirunt ac velut adgnoscere concupiscunt$$ Strangers too and foreigners ,  having heard of him in their towns and colonies ,  as soon as they have arrived at Rome ,  ask for him and are eager ,  as it were ,  to recognise him
 Ausim contendere Marcellum hunc Eprium , de quo modo locutus sum , et Crispum Vibium (libentius enim novis et recentibus quam remotis et oblitteratis exemplis utor) non minores esse in extremis partibus terrarum quam Capuae aut Vercellis , ubi nati dicuntur$$ As for Marcellus Eprius ,  whom I have just mentioned ,  and Crispus Vibius (it is pleasanter to me to cite recent and modern examples than those of a distant and forgotten past) ,  I would venture to argue that they are quite as great men in the remotest corners of the world as at Capua or Vercellae ,  where they are said to have been born
 Nec hoc illis alterius bis alterius ter milies sestertium praestat , quamquam ad has ipsas opes possunt videri eloquentiae beneficio venisse , sed ipsa eloquentia$$ Nor do they owe this to the three hundred million sesterces of the one ,  although it may seem that they must thank their eloquence for having attained such wealth
 cuius numen et caelestis vis multa quidem omnibus saeculis exempla edidit , ad quam usque fortunam homines ingenii viribus pervenerint , sed haec , ut supra dixi , proxima et quae non auditu cognoscenda , sed oculis spectanda haberemus$$ Eloquence itself is the cause Its inspiration and superhuman power have throughout all times shown by many an example what a height of fortune men have reached by the might of genius
 Nam quo sordidius et abiectius nati sunt quoque notabilior paupertas et angustiae rerum nascentis eos circumsteterunt , eo clariora et ad demonstrandam oratoriae eloquentiae utilitatem inlustriora exempla sunt , quod sine commendatione natalium , sine substantia facultatum , neuter moribus egregius , alter habitu quoque corporis contemptus , per multos iam annos potentissimi sunt civitatis ac , donec libuit , principes fori , nunc principes in Caesaris amicitia agunt feruntque cuncta atque ab ipso principe cum quadam reverentia diliguntur , quia Vespasianus , venerabilis senex et patientissimus veri , bene intellegit et ceteros quidem amicos suos iis niti , quae ab ipso acceperint quaeque ipsis accumulare et in alios congerere promptum sit , Marcellum autem et Crispum attulisse ad amicitiam suam quod non a principe acceperint nec accipi possit Ninimum inter tot ac tanta locum obtinent imagines ac tituli et statuae , quae neque ipsa tamen negleguntur , tam hercule quam divitiae et opes , quas facilius invenies qui vituperet quam qui fastidiat$$ But there are ,  as I said but now ,  instances close at hand ,  and we may know them ,  not by hearsay ,  but may see them with our eyes The lower and meaner their birth ,  the more notorious the poverty and the straitened means amid which their life began ,  the more famous and brilliant are they as examples to show the efficacy of an orator's eloquence Without the recommendation of birth ,  without the support of riches ,  neither of the two distinguished for virtue ,  one even despised for the appearance of his person ,  they have now for many years been the most powerful men in the state ,  and ,  as long as it suited them ,  they were the leaders of the bar At this moment ,  as leading men in the emperor's friendship they carry all before them ,  and even the leading man himself of the State esteems and almost reverences them Vespasian indeed ,  venerable in his old age and most tolerant of truth ,  knows well that while his other friends are dependent on what he has given them ,  and on what it is easy for him to heap and pile on others ,  Marcellus and Crispus ,  in becoming his friends ,  brought with them something which they had not received and which could not be received from a prince
 His igitur et honoribus et ornamentis et facultatibus refertas domos eorum videmus , qui se ab ineunte adulescentia causis forensibus et oratorio studio dederunt$$ Amid so much that is great ,  busts ,  inscriptions ,  and statues hold but a very poor place
 Nam carmina et versus , quibus totam vitam Maternus insumere optat (inde enim omnis fluxit oratio) , neque dignitatem ullam auctoribus suis conciliant neque utilitates alunt$$ As for song and verse to which Maternus wishes to devote his whole life (for this was the starting-point of his entire argument) ,  they bring no dignity to the author ,  nor do they improve his circumstances
 voluptatem autem brevem , laudem inanem et infructuosam consequuntur$$ Although your ears ,  Maternus ,  may loathe what I am about to say ,  I ask what good it is if Agamemnon or Jason speaks eloquently in your composition
 licet haec ipsa et quae deinceps dicturus sum aures tuae , Materne , respuant , cui bono est , si apud te Agamemnon aut Iason diserte loquitur$$ Who the more goes back to his home saved from danger and bound to you
 Quis ideo domum defensus et tibi obligatus redit$$ Our friend Saleius is an admirable poet ,  or ,  if the phrase be more complimentary ,  a most illustrious bard
 Quis Saleium nostrum , egregium poetam vel , si hoc honorificentius est , praeclarissimum vatem , deducit aut salutat aut prosequitur$$ but who walks by his side or attends his receptions or follows in his train
 Nempe si amicus eius , si propinquus , si denique ipse in aliquod negotium inciderit , ad hunc Secundum recurret aut ad te , Materne , non quia poeta es , neque ut pro eo versus facias$$ Why ,  if his friend or relative or even he himself stumbles into some troublesome affair ,  he will run to Secundus here ,  or to you ,  Maternus ,  not because you are a poet or that you may make verses for him
 hi enim Basso domi nascuntur , pulchri quidem et iucundi , quorum tamen hic exitus est , ut cum toto anno , per omnes dies , magna noctium parte unum librum excudit et elucubravit , rogare ultro et ambire cogatur , ut sint qui dignentur audire , et ne id quidem gratis$$ for verses come naturally to Bassus in his own home ,  and pretty and charming they are ,  though the result of them is that when ,  with the labour of a whole year ,  through entire days and the best part of the nights ,  he has hammered out ,  with the midnight oil ,  a single book ,  he is forced actually to beg and canvass for people who will condescend to be his hearers ,  and not even this without cost to himself
 nam et domum mutuatur et auditorium exstruit et subsellia conducit et libellos dispergit$$ He gets the loan of a house ,  fits up a room ,  hires benches ,  and scatters programmes
 Et ut beatissimus recitationem eius eventus prosequatur , omnis illa laus intra unum aut alterum diem , velut in herba vel flore praecerpta , ad nullam certam et solidam pervenit frugem , nec aut amicitiam inde refert aut clientelam aut mansurum in animo cuiusquam beneficium , sed clamorem vagum et voces inanis et gaudium volucre$$ Even if his reading is followed by a complete success ,  all the glory is ,  so to say ,  cut short in the bloom and the flower ,  and does not come to any real and substantial fruit He carries away with him not a single friendship ,  not a single client ,  not an obligation that will abide in anyone's mind ,  only idle applause ,  meaningless acclamations and a fleeting delight
 laudavimus nuper ut miram et eximiam Vespasiani liberalitatem , quod quingenta sestertia Basso donasset$$ We lately praised Vespasian's bounty ,  in giving Bassus four thousand pounds ,  as something marvellous and splendid
 pulchrum id quidem , indulgentiam principis ingenio mereri$$ It is no doubt a fine thing to win an emperor's favour by talent
 quanto tamen pulchrius , si ita res familiaris exigat , se ipsum colere , suum genium propitiare , suam experiri liberalitatem! adice quod poetis , si modo dignum aliquid elaborare et efficere velint , relinquenda conversatio amicorum et iucunditas urbis , deserenda cetera officia utque ipsi dicunt , in nemora et lucos , id est in solitudinem secedendum est$$ but how much finer ,  if domestic circumstances so require ,  to cultivate one ,  self ,  to make one's own genius propitious ,  to fall back on one's own bounty Consider too that a poet ,  if he wishes to work out and accomplish a worthy result ,  must leave the society of his friends ,  and the attractions of the capital
 Ne opinio quidem et fama , cui soli serviunt et quod unum esse pretium omnis laboris sui fatentur , aeque poetas quam oratores sequitur , quoniam mediocris poetas nemo novit , bonos pauci$$ Nor again do even reputation and fame ,  the only object of their devotion ,  the sole reward of their labours ,  by their own confession ,  cling to the poet as much as to the orator
 Quando enim rarissimarum recitationum fama in totam urbem penetrat$$ for indifferent poets are known to none ,  and the good but to a few
 Nedum ut per tot provincias innotescat$$ When does the rumour of the very choicest readings penetrate every part of Rome ,  much less is talked of throughout our numerous provinces
 Quotus quisque , cum ex Hispania vel Asia , ne quid de Gallis nostris loquar , in urbem venit , Saleium Bassum requirit$$ How few ,  when they visit the capital from Spain or Asia ,  to say nothing of our Gallic neighbours ,  ask after Saleius Bassus! And indeed ,  if any one does ask after him ,  having once seen him ,  he passes on ,  and is satisfied ,  as if he had seen a picture or a statue
 Atque adeo si quis requirit , ut semel vidit , transit et contentus est , ut si picturam aliquam vel statuam vidisset$$ I do not wish my remarks to be taken as implying that I would deter from poetry those to whom nature has denied the orator's talent ,  if only they can amuse their leisure and push themselves into fame by this branch of culture
 Neque hunc meum sermonem sic accipi volo , tamquam eos , quibus natura sua oratorium ingenium denegavit , deterream a carminibus , si modo in hac studiorum parte oblectare otium et nomen inserere possunt famae$$ For my part I hold all eloquence in its every variety something sacred and venerable ,  and I regard as preferable to all studies of other arts not merely your tragedian's buskin or the measures of heroic verse ,  but even the sweetness of the lyric ode ,  the playfulness of the elegy ,  the satire of the iambic ,  the wit of the epigram ,  and indeed any other form of eloquence
 Ego vero omnem eloquentiam omnisque eius partis sacras et venerabilis puto , nec solum cothurnum vestrum aut heroici carminis sonum , sed lyricorum quoque iucunditatem et elegorum lascivias et iamborum amaritudinem et epigrammatum lusus et quamcumque aliam speciem eloquentia habeat , anteponendam ceteris aliarum artium studiis credo Sed tecum mihi , Materne , res est , quod , cum natura tua in ipsam arcem eloquentiae ferat , errare mavis et summa adepturus in levioribus subsistis$$ But it is with you ,  Maternus ,  that I am dealing for ,  when your genius might carry you to the summit of eloquence ,  you prefer to wander from the path ,  and though sure to win the highest prize you stop short at meaner things Just as ,  if you had been born in Greece ,  where it is an honour to practise even the arts of the arena ,  and if the gods had given you the vigour and strength of Nicostratus ,  I should not suffer those giant arms meant by nature for combat to waste themselves on the light javelin or the throwing of the quoit ,  so now I summon you from the lecture-room and the theatre to the law court with its pleadings and its real battles
 ut si in Graecia natus esses , ubi ludicras quoque artis exercere honestum est , ac tibi Nicostrati robur ac vires di dedissent , non paterer inmanis illos et ad pugnam natos lacertos levitate iaculi aut iactu disci vanescere , sic nunc te ab auditoriis et theatris in forum et ad causas et ad vera proelia voco , cum praesertim ne ad illud quidem confugere possis , quod plerisque patrocinatur , tamquam minus obnoxium sit offendere poetarum quam oratorum studium$$ I do this the more because you cannot even fall back on the refuge which shelters many ,  the plea that the poet's pursuit is less liable to give offence than that of the orator In truth ,  with you the ardour of a peculiarly noble nature bursts forth ,  and the offence you give is not for the sake of a friend ,  but ,  what is more dangerous ,  for the sake of Cato Nor is this offending excused by the obligation of duty ,  or by the fidelity of an advocate ,  or by the impulse of a casual and sudden speech
 Effervescit enim vis pulcherrimae naturae tuae , nec pro amico aliquo , sed , quod periculosius est , pro Catone offendis$$ You have ,  it seems ,  prepared your part in having chosen a character of note who would speak with authority
 Nec excusatur offensa necessitudine officii aut fide advocationis aut fortuitae et subitae dictionis impetu$$ I foresee your possible answer
 meditatus videris aut elegisse personam notabilem et cum auctoritate dicturam$$ Hence ,  you will say ,  came the decisive approval
 Sentio quid responderi possit$$ this is the style which the lecture-room chiefly praises ,  and which next becomes the world's talk
 hinc ingentis ex his adsensus , haec in ipsis auditoriis praecipue laudari et mox omnium sermonibus ferri$$ Away then with the excuse of quiet and safety ,  when you are deliberately choosing a more doughty adversary
 Tolle igitur quietis et securitatis excusationem , cum tibi sumas adversarium superiorem$$ For myself ,  let it be enough to take a side in the private disputes of our own time
 Nobis satis sit privatas et nostri saeculi controversias tueri , in quibus expressis si quando necesse sit pro periclitante amico potentiorum aures offendere , et probata sit fides et libertas excusata$$ In these ,  if at any time necessity has compelled us on behalf of an imperilled friend to offend the ears of the powerful ,  our loyalty must be approved ,  our liberty of speech condoned
 Quae cum dixisset Aper acrius , ut solebat , et intento ore , remissus et subridens Maternus parantem inquit me non minus diu accusare oratores quam Aper laudaverat (fore enim arbitrabar ut a laudatione eorum digressus detrectaret poetas atque carminum studium prosterneret) arte quadam mitigavit , concedendo iis , qui causas agere non possent , ut versus facerent$$ Aper having said this with his usual spirit and with vehemence of utterance ,  Maternus replied good-humouredly with something of a smile I was preparing to attack the orators at as great length as Aper had praised them ,  for I thought that he would leave his praises of them and go on to demolish poets and the pursuit of poetry ,  but he appeased me by a sort of stratagem ,  granting permission to those who cannot plead causes ,  to make verses
 Ego autem sicut in causis agendis efficere aliquid et eniti fortasse possum , ita recitatione tragoediarum et ingredi famam auspicatus sum , cum quidem imperante Nerone inprobam et studiorum quoque sacra profanantem Vatinii potentiam fregi , et hodie si quid in nobis notitiae ac nominis est , magis arbitror carminum quam orationum gloria partum$$ For myself ,  though I am perhaps able to accomplish and effect something in pleading causes ,  yet it was by the public reading of tragedies that I first began to enter the path of fame ,  when in Nero's time I broke the wicked power of Vatinius by which even the sanctities of culture were profaned ,  and if at this moment I possess any celebrity and distinction I maintain that it has been acquired more by the renown of my poems than of my speeches
 ac iam me deiungere a forensi labore constitui , nec comitatus istos et egressus aut frequentiam salutantium concupisco , non magis quam aera et imagines , quae etiam me nolente in domum meam inruperunt$$ And so now I have resolved to throw off the yoke of my labours at the bar ,  and for trains of followers on my way to and from the court and for crowded receptions I crave no more than for the bronzes and busts which have invaded my house even against my will
 Nam statum cuiusque ac securitatem melius innocentia tuetur quam eloquentia , nec vereor ne mihi umquam verba in senatu nisi pro alterius discrimine facienda sint$$ For hitherto I have upheld my position and my safety better by integrity than by eloquence ,  and I am not afraid of having ever to say a word in the senate except to avert peril from another
 Nemora vero et luci et secretum ipsum , quod Aper increpabat , tantam mihi adferunt voluptatem , ut inter praecipuos carminum fructus numerem , quod non in strepitu nec sedente ante ostium litigatore nec inter sordes ac lacrimas reorum componuntur , sed secedit animus in loca pura atque innocentia fruiturque sedibus sacris$$ As to the woods and groves and that retirement which Aper denounced ,  they bring such delight to me that I count among the chief enjoyments of poetry the fact that it is composed not in the midst of bustle ,  or with a suitor sitting before one's door ,  or amid the wretchedness and tears of prisoners ,  but that the soul withdraws herself to abodes of purity and innocence ,  and enjoys her holy resting-place
 Haec eloquentiae primordia , haec penetralia$$ Here eloquence had her earliest beginnings
 hoc primum habitu cultuque commoda mortalibus in illa casta et nullis contacta vitiis pectora influxit$$ here is her inmost shrine In such guise and beauty did she first charm mortals ,  and steal into those virgin hearts which no vice had contaminated
 sic oracula loquebantur$$ Oracles spoke under these conditions
 Nam lucrosae huius et sanguinantis eloquentiae usus recens et ex malis moribus natus , atque , ut tu dicebas , Aper , in locum teli repertus$$ As for the present money-getting and blood-stained eloquence ,  its use is modern ,  its origin in corrupt manners ,  and ,  as you said ,  Aper ,  it is a device to serve as a weapon
 Ceterum felix illud et , ut more nostro loquar , aureum saeculum , et oratorum et criminum inops , poetis et vatibus abundabat , qui bene facta canerent , non qui male admissa defenderent$$ But the happy golden age ,  to speak in our own poetic fashion ,  knew neither orators nor accusations ,  while it abounded in poets and bards ,  men who could sing of good deeds ,  but not defend evil actions
 Nec ullis aut gloria maior aut augustior honor , primum apud deos , quorum proferre responsa et interesse epulis ferebantur , deinde apud illos dis genitos sacrosque reges , inter quos neminem causidicum , sed Orphea ac Linum ac , si introspicere altius velis , ipsum Apollinem accepimus$$ None enjoyed greater glory ,  or honours more august ,  first with the gods ,  whose answers they published ,  and at whose feasts they were present ,  as was commonly said ,  and then with the offspring of the gods and with sacred kings ,  among whom ,  so we have understood ,  was not a single pleader of causes ,  but an Orpheus ,  a Linus ,  and ,  if you care to dive into a remoter age ,  an Apollo himself
 vel si haec fabulosa nimis et composita videntur , illud certe mihi concedes , Aper , non minorem honorem Homero quam Demostheni apud posteros , nec angustioribus terminis famam Euripidis aut Sophoclis quam Lysiae aut Hyperidis includi$$ Or ,  if you think all this too fabulous and imaginary ,  at least you grant me that Homer has as much honour with posterity as Demosthenes ,  and that the fame of Euripides or Sophocles is bounded by a limit not narrower than that of Lysias or Hyperides
 Pluris hodie reperies , qui Ciceronis gloriam quam qui Virgilii detrectent$$ You will find in our own day more who disparage Cicero's than Virgil's glory
 nec ullus Asinii aut Messallae liber tam inlustris est quam Medea Ovidii aut Varii Thyestes$$ Nor is any production of Asinius or Messala so famous as Ovid's Medea or the Thyestes of Varius
 Ac ne fortunam quidem vatum et illud felix contubernium comparare timuerim cum inquieta et anxia oratorum vita$$ Look again at the poet's lot ,  with its delightful companionships
 licet illos certamina et pericula sua ad consulatus evexerint , malo securum et quietum Virgilii secessum , in quo tamen neque apud divum Augustum gratia caruit neque apud populum Romanum notitia$$ I should not be afraid of comparing it with the harassing and anxious life of the orator Orators ,  it is true ,  have been raised to consulships by their contests and perils ,  but I prefer Virgil's serene ,  calm ,  and peaceful retirement ,  in which after all he was not without the favour of the di-vine Augustus ,  and fame among the people of Rome
 Testes Augusti epistulae , testis ipse populus , qui auditis in theatro Virgilii versibus surrexit universus et forte praesentem spectantemque Virgilium veneratus est sic quasi Augustum$$ We have the testimony of the letters of Augustus ,  the testimony too of the people themselves ,  who ,  on hearing in the theatre some of Virgil's verses ,  rose in a body and did homage to the poet ,  who happened to be present as a spectator ,  just as to Augustus himself
 Ne nostris quidem temporibus Secundus Pomponius Afro Domitio vel dignitate vitae vel perpetuitate famae cesserit$$ Even in our own day ,  Pomponius Serundus need not yield to Domitius Aper on the score of a dignified life or an enduring reputation
 Nam Crispus iste et Marcellus , ad quorum exempla me vocas , quid habent in hac sua fortuna concupiscendum$$ As for your Crispus and Marcellus ,  whom you hold up to me as examples ,  what is there in their lot to be coveted
 Quod timent , an quod timentur$$ Is it that they are in fear themselves ,  or are a fear to others
 Quod , cum cotidie aliquid rogentur , ii quibus praestant indignantur$$ Is it that ,  while every day something is asked from them ,  those to whom they grant it feel indignant
 Quod adligati omni adulatione nec imperantibus umquam satis servi videntur nec nobis satis liberi$$ Is it that ,  bound as they are by the chain of flattery ,  they are never thought servile enough by those who rule ,  or free enough by us
 Quae haec summa eorum potentia est$$ What is their power at its highest
 tantum posse liberti solent$$ Why ,  the freedmen usually have as much
 Ne vero dulces , ut Virgilius ait , Musae , remotum a sollicitudinibus et curis et necessitate cotidie aliquid contra animum faciendi , in illa sacra illosque fontis ferant$$ For my self ,  as Virgil says ,  let the sweet muses lead me to their sacred retreats ,  and to their fountains far away from anxieties and cares ,  and the necessity of doing every day something repugnant to my heart
 nec insanum ultra et lubricum forum famamque pallentem trepidus experiar$$ Let me no longer tremblingly experience the madness and perils of the forum ,  and the pallors of fame
 Non me fremitus salutantium nec anhelans libertus excitet , nec incertus futuri testamentum pro pignore scribam , nec plus habeam quam quod possim cui velim relinquere$$ Let me not be aroused by a tumult of morning visitors ,  or a freedman's panting haste ,  or ,  anxious about the future ,  have to make a will to secure my wealth
 quandoque enim fatalis et meus dies veniet$$ Let me not possess more than what I can leave to whom I please ,  whenever the day appointed by my own fates shall come
 statuarque tumulo non maestus et atrox , sed hilaris et coronatus , et pro memoria mei nec consulat quisquam nec roget$$ and let the statue over my tomb be not gloomy and scowling ,  but bright and laurel-crowned
 Vixdum finierat Maternus , concitatus et velut instinctus , cum Vipstanus Messalla cubiculum eius ingressus est , suspicatusque ex ipsa intentione singulorum altiorem inter eos esse sermonem , num parum tempestivus inquit interveni secretum consilium et causae alicuius meditationem tractantibus Minime , minime inquit Secundus , atque adeo vellem maturius intervenisses delectasset enim te et Apri nostri accuratissimus sermo , cum Maternum ut omne ingenium ac studium suum ad causas agendas converteret exhortatus est , et Materni pro carminibus suis laeta , utque poetas defendi decebat , audentior et poetarum quam oratorum similior oratio Me vero inquit et sermo iste infinita voluptate adfecisset , atque id ipsum delectat , quod vos , viri optimi et temporum nostrorum oratores , non forensibus tantum negotiis et declamatorio studio ingenia vestra exercetis , sed eius modi etiam disputationes adsumitis , quae et ingenium alunt et eruditionis ac litterarum iucundissimum oblectamentum cum vobis , qui ista disputatis , adferunt , tum etiam iis , ad quorum auris pervenerint Itaque hercule non minus probari video in te , Secunde , quod Iuli Africani vitam componendo spem hominibus fecisti plurium eius modi librorum , quam in Apro , quod nondum ab scholasticis controversiis recessit et otium suum mavult novorum rhetorum more quam veterum oratorum consumere$$ Excited and ,  I say ,  full of enthusiasm ,  Maternus had hardly finished when Vipstanus Messala entered his room ,  and ,  from the earnest expression on each face ,  he conjectured that their conversation was unusually serious Have I ,  he asked ,  come among you unseasonably ,  while you are engaged in private deliberation ,  or the preparation of some case
 Tum Aper non desinis , Messalla , vetera tantum et antiqua mirari , nostrorum autem temporum studia inridere atque contemnere$$ Upon this Aper replied ,  You still persist ,  Messala ,  in admiring only what is old and antique and in sneering at and disparaging the culture of our own day
 Nam hunc tuum sermonem saepe excepi , cum oblitus et tuae et fratris tui eloquentiae neminem hoc tempore oratorem esse contenderes antiquis , eo , credo , audacius , quod malignitatis opinionem non verebaris , cum eam gloriam , quam tibi alii concedunt , ipse tibi denegares$$ I have often heard this sort of talk from you ,  when ,  forgetting the eloquence of yourself and your brother ,  you argued that nobody in this age is an orator And you did this ,  I believe ,  with the more audacity because you were not afraid of a reputation for ill-nature ,  seeing that the glory which others concede to you ,  you deny to yourself
 Neque illius inquit sermonis mei paenitentiam ago , neque aut Secundum aut Maternum aut te ipsum , Aper , quamquam interdum in contrarium disputes , aliter sentire credo$$ I feel no penitence ,  said Messala ,  for such talk ,  nor do I believe that Secundus or Maternus or you yourself ,  Aper ,  think differently ,  though now and then you argue for the opposite view
 Ac velim impetratum ab aliquo vestrum ut causas huius infinitae differentiae scrutetur ac reddat , quas mecum ipse plerumque conquiro$$ I could wish that one of you were prevailed on to investigate and describe to us the reasons of this vast difference
 Et quod quibusdam solacio est , mihi auget quaestionem , quia video etiam Graecis accidisse ut longius absit ab Aeschine et Demosthene Sacerdos ille Nicetes , et si quis alius Ephesum vel Mytilenas concentu scholasticorum et clamoribus quatit , quam Afer aut Africanus aut vos ipsi a Cicerone aut Asinio recessistis$$ I often inquire into them by myself That which consoles some minds ,  to me increases the difficulty For I perceive that even with the Greeks it has happened that there is a greater distance between Aeschines and Demosthenes on the one hand ,  and your friend Nicetes or any other orator who shakes Ephesus or Mitylene with a chorus of rhetoricians and their noisy applause ,  on the other ,  than that which separates Afer ,  Africanus ,  or yourselves from Cicero or Asinius
 Magnam inquit Secundus et dignam tractatu quaestionem movisti Sed quis eam iustius explicabit quam tu , ad cuius summam eruditionem et praestantissimum ingenium cura quoque et meditatio accessit Et Messalla aperiam inquit cogitationes meas , si illud a vobis ante impetravero , ut vos quoque sermonem hunc nostrum adiuvetis Pro duobus inquit Maternus promitto nam et ego et Secundus exsequemur eas partis , quas intellexerimus te non tam omisisse quam nobis reliquisse Aprum enim solere dissentire et tu paulo ante dixisti et ipse satis manifestus est iam dudum in contrarium accingi nec aequo animo perferre hanc nostram pro antiquorum laude concordiam$$ The question you have raised ,  said Secundus ,  is a great one and quite worthy of discussion
 Non enim inquit Aper inauditum et indefensum saeculum nostrum patiar hac vestra conspiratione damnari sed hoc primum interrogabo , quos vocetis antiquos , quam oratorum aetatem significatione ista determinetis Ego enim cum audio antiquos , quosdam veteres et olim natos intellego , ac mihi versantur ante oculos Ulixes ac Nestor , quorum aetas mille fere et trecentis annis saeculum nostrum antecedit vos autem Demosthenem et Hyperidem profertis , quos satis constat Philippi et Alexandri temporibus floruisse , ita tamen ut utrique superstites essent Ex quo apparet non multo pluris quam trecentos annos interesse inter nostram et Demosthenis aetatem Quod spatium temporis si ad infirmitatem corporum nostrorum referas , fortasse longum videatur si ad naturam saeculorum ac respectum inmensi huius aevi , perquam breve et in proximo est Nam si , ut Cicero in Hortensio scribit , is est magnus et verus annus , par quo eadem positio caeli siderumque , quae cum maxime est , rursum existet , isque annus horum quos nos vocamus annorum duodecim milia nongentos quinquaginta quattuor complectitur , incipit Demosthenes vester , quem vos veterem et antiquum fingitis , non solum eodem anno quo nos , sed etiam eodem mense extitisse$$ But who has a better claim to unravel it than yourself ,  you who to profound learning and transcendent ability have added reflection and study
 Sed transeo ad Latinos oratores , in quibus non Menenium , ut puto , Agrippam , qui potest videri antiquus , nostrorum temporum disertis anteponere soletis , sed Ciceronem et Caesarem et Caelium et Calvum et Brutum et Asinium et Messallam$$ But I pass to the Latin orators Among them ,  it is not ,  I imagine ,  Menenius Agrippa ,  who may seem ancient ,  whom you usually prefer to the speakers of our day ,  but Cicero ,  Caelius ,  Calvus ,  Brutus ,  Asinius ,  Messala
 quos quid antiquis potius temporibus adscribatis quam nostris , non video$$ Why you assign them to antiquity rather than to our own times ,  I do not see
 Nam ut de Cicerone ipso loquar , Hirtio nempe et Pansa consulibus , ut Tiro libertus eius scribit , septimo idus Decembris occisus est , quo anno divus Augustus in locum Pansae et Hirtii se et Quintus Pedium consules suffecit$$ With respect to Cicero himself ,  it was in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa ,  as his freedman Tiro has stated ,  on the 5th of December ,  that he was slain
 Statue sex et quinquaginta annos , quibus mox divus Augustus rem publicam rexit$$ In that same year the Divine Augustus elected himself and Quintus Pedius consuls in the room of Pansa and Hirtius
 adice Tiberii tris et viginti , et prope quadriennium Gai , ac bis quaternos denos Claudii et Neronis annos , atque illum Galbae et Othonis et Vitellii longum et unum annum , ac sextam iam felicis huius principatus stationem , qua Vespasianus rem publicam fovet centum et viginti anni ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem colliguntur , unius hominis aetas$$ Fix at fifty-six years the subsequent rule of the Divine Augustus over the state add Tiberius's three-and-twenty years ,  the four years or less of Caius ,  the twenty-eight years of Claudius and Nero ,  the one memorable long year of Galba ,  Otho ,  and Vitellius ,  and the now six years of the present happy reign ,  during which Vespasian has been fostering the public weal ,  and the result is that from Cicero's death to our day is a hundred and twenty years ,  one man's life-time
 Nam ipse ego in Britannia vidi senem , qui se fateretur ei pugnae interfuisse , qua Caesarem inferentem arma Britanniae arcere litoribus et pellere adgressi sunt$$ For I saw myself an old man in Britain who declared that he was present at the battle in which they strove to drive and beat back from their shores the arms of Cæsar when he attacked their island
 Ita si eum , qui armatus Gaius Caesari restitit , vel captivitas vel voluntas vel fatum aliquod in urbem pertraxisset , aeque idem et Caesarem ipsum et Ciceronem audire potuit et nostris quoque actionibus interesse$$ So ,  had this man who encountered Cæsar in the field ,  been brought to Rome either as a prisoner ,  or by his own choice or by some destiny ,  he might have heard Cæsar himself and Cicero ,  and also have been present at our own speeches
 Proximo quidem congiario ipsi vidistis plerosque senes , qui se a divo quoque Augusto semel atque iterum accepisse congiarium narrabant$$ At the last largess of the Emperor you saw yourselves several old men who told you that they had actually shared once and again in the gifts of the divine Augustus
 Ex quo colligi potest et Corvinum ab illis et Asinium audiri potuisse$$ Hence we infer that they might have heard both Corvinus and Asinius
 nam Corvinus in medium usque Augusti principatum , Asinius paene ad extremum duravit , ne dividatis saeculum , et antiquos ac veteres vocitetis oratores , quos eorundem hominum aures adgnoscere ac velut coniungere et copulare potuerunt$$ Corvinus indeed lived on to the middle of the reign of Augustus ,  Asinius almost to its close You must not then divide the age ,  and habitually describe as old and ancient orators those with whom the ears of the self-same men might have made acquaintance ,  and whom they might ,  so to say ,  have linked and coupled together
 Haec ideo praedixi , ut si qua ex horum oratorum fama gloriaque laus temporibus adquiritur , eam docerem in medio sitam et propiorem nobis quam Servio Galbae aut Gaius Carboni quosque alios merito antiquos vocaverimus$$ I have made these preliminary remarks to show that any credit reflected on the age by the fame and renown of these orators is common property ,  and is in fact more closely connected with us than with Servius Galba or Caius Carbo ,  and others whom we may rightly call ancients
 sunt enim horridi et inpoliti et rudes et informes et quos utinam nulla parte imitatus esset Calvus vester aut Caelius aut ipse Cicero$$ These indeed are rough ,  unpolished ,  awkward ,  and ungainly ,  and I wish that your favourite Calvus or Caelius or even Cicero had in no respect imitated them
 Agere enim fortius iam et audentius volo , si illud ante praedixero , mutari cum temporibus formas quoque et genera dicendi$$ I really mean now to deal with the subject more boldly and confidently ,  but I must first observe that the types and varieties of eloquence change with the age
 Sic Catoni seni comparatus Gaius Gracchus plenior et uberior , sic Graccho politior et ornatior Crassus , sic utroque distinctior et urbanior et altior Cicero , Cicerone mitior Corvinus et dulcior et in verbis magis elaboratus$$ Thus Caius Gracchus compared with the elder Cato is full and copious Crassus compared with Gracchus is polished and ornate Cicero compared with either is lucid ,  graceful ,  and lofty
 Nec quaero quis disertissimus$$ Corvinus again is softer and sweeter and more finished in his phrases than Cicero
 hoc interim probasse contentus sum , non esse unum eloquentiae vultum , sed in illis quoque quos vocatis antiquos pluris species deprehendi , nec statim deterius esse quod diversum est , vitio autem malignitatis humanae vetera semper in laude , praesentia in fastidio esse$$ I do not ask who is the best speaker Meantime I am content to have proved that eloquence has more than one face ,  and even in those whom you Call ancients several varieties are to be discovered Nor does it at once follow that difference implies inferiority
 Num dubitamus inventos qui prae Catone Appium Caecum magis mirarentur$$ It is the fault of envious human nature that the old is always the object of praise ,  the present of contempt
 satis constat ne Ciceroni quidem obtrectatores defuisse , quibus inflatus et tumens nec satis pressus , sed supra modum exsultans et superfluens et parum Atticus videretur$$ Can we doubt that there were found critics who admired Appius Caecus more than Cato We know that even Cicero was not without his disparagers ,  who thought him inflated ,  turgid ,  not concise enough ,  but unduly diffuse and luxuriant ,  in short anything but Attic
 legistis utique et Calvi et Bruti ad Ciceronem missas epistulas , ex quibus facile est deprehendere Calvum quidem Ciceroni visum exsanguem et aridum , Brutum autem otiosum atque diiunctum$$ You have read of course the letters of Calvus and Brutus to Cicero ,  and from these it is easy to perceive that in Cicero's opinion Calvus was bloodless and attenuated ,  Brutus slovenly and lax
 rursusque Ciceronem a Calvo quidem male audisse tamquam solutum et enervem , a Bruto autem , ut ipsius verbis utar , tamquam fractum atque elumbem$$ Cicero again was slightingly spoken of by Calvus as loose and nerveless ,  and by Brutus ,  to use his own words ,  as languid and effeminate
 si me interroges , omnes mihi videntur verum dixisse$$ If you ask me ,  I think they all said what was true
 sed mox ad singulos veniam , nunc mihi cum universis negotium est$$ But I shall come to them separately after a while
 Quis nunc feret oratorem de infirmitate valetudinis suae praefantem$$ Who will now tolerate an advocate who begins by speaking of the feebleness of his constitution ,  as is usual in the openings of Corvinus
 Qualia sunt fere principia Corvini$$ Who will sit out the five books against Verres
 Quis quinque in Verrem libros exspectabit$$ Who will endure those huge volumes ,  on a legal plea or form ,  which we have read in the speeches for Marcus Tullius and Aulus Caecina
 Quis de exceptione et formula perpetietur illa inmensa volumina , quae pro Marcus Tullio aut Aulo Caecina legimus$$ In our day the judge anticipates the speaker ,  and unless he is charmed and imposed on by the train of arguments ,  or the brilliancy of the thoughts ,  or the grace and elegance of the descriptive sketches ,  he is deaf to his eloquence
 Praecurrit hoc tempore iudex dicentem et , nisi aut cursu argumentorum aut colore sententiarum aut nitore et cultu descriptionum invitatus et corruptus est , aversatur dicentem$$ Even the mob of bystanders ,  and the chance listeners who flock in ,  now usually require brightness and beauty in a speech ,  and they no more endure in the law-court the harshness and roughness of antiquity ,  than they would an actor on the stage who chose to reproduce the gestures of Roscius or Ambivius
 Vulgus quoque adsistentium et adfluens et vagus auditor adsuevit iam exigere laetitiam et pulchritudinem orationis$$ So again the young ,  those whose studies are on the anvil ,  who go after the orators with a view to their own progress ,  are anxious not merely to hear but also to carry back home some brilliant passage worthy of remembrance
 nec magis perfert in iudiciis tristem et impexam antiquitatem quam si quis in scaena Roscii aut Turpionis Ambivii exprimere gestus velit$$ They tell it one to another ,  and often mention it in letters to their colonies and provinces ,  whether it is a reflection lighted up by a neat and pithy phrase ,  or a passage bright with choice and poetic ornament
 Iam vero iuvenes et in ipsa studiorum incude positi , qui profectus sui causa oratores sectantur , non solum audire , sed etiam referre domum aliquid inlustre et dignum memoria volunt$$ For we now expect from a speaker even poetic beauty ,  not indeed soiled with the old rust of Accius or Pacuvius ,  but such as is produced from the sacred treasures of Horace ,  Virgil ,  and Lucan
 traduntque in vicem ac saepe in colonias ac provincias suas scribunt , sive sensus aliquis arguta et brevi sententia effulsit , sive locus exquisito et poetico cultu enituit$$ Thus the age of our orators ,  in conforming itself to the ear and the taste of such a class ,  has advanced in beauty and ornateness
 Exigitur enim iam ab oratore etiam poeticus decor , non Accii aut Pacuvii veterno inquinatus , sed ex Horatii et Virgilii et Lucani sacrario prolatus$$ Nor does it follow that our speeches are less successful because they bring pleasure to the ears of those who have to decide
 Horum igitur auribus et iudiciis obtemperans nostrorum oratorum aetas pulchrior et ornatior extitit$$ What if you were to assume that the temples of the present day are weaker ,  because ,  instead of being built of rough blocks and ill-shaped tiles ,  they shine with marble and glitter with gold
 Equidem fatebor vobis simpliciter me in quibusdam antiquorum vix risum , in quibusdam autem vix somnum tenere$$ I will frankly admit to you that I can hardly keep from laughing at some of the ancients ,  and from falling asleep at others
 Nec unum de populo Canuti aut Atti    de Furnio et Toranio quique alios in eodem valetudinario haec ossa et hanc maciem probant$$ I do not single out any of the common herd ,  as Canutius ,  or Arrius ,  and others in the same sick-room ,  so to say ,  who are content with mere skin and bones
 ipse mihi Calvus , cum unum et viginti , utpar puto , libros reliquerit , vix in una et altera oratiuncula satis facit$$ Even Calvus ,  although he has left ,  I think ,  one-and-twenty volumes ,  scarcely satisfies me in one or two short speeches
 Nec dissentire ceteros ab hoc meo iudicio video$$ The rest of the world ,  I see ,  does not differ from my opinion about him
 quotus enim quisque Calvi in Asitium aut in Drusum legit At hercule in omnium studiosorum manibus versantur accusationes quae in Vatinium inscribuntur , ac praecipue secunda ex his oratio$$ for how few read his speeches against Asitius or Drusus! Certainly his impeachment of Vatinius ,  as it is entitled ,  is in the hands of students ,  especially the second of the orations
 est enim verbis ornata et sententiis , auribus iudicum accommodata , ut scias ipsum quoque Calvum intellexisse quid melius esset , nec voluntatem ei , quo minus sublimius et cultius diceret , sed ingenium ac vires defuisse$$ This ,  indeed ,  has a finish about the phrases and the periods ,  and suits the ear of the critic ,  whence you may infer that even Calvus understood what a better style is ,  but that he lacked genius and power rather than the will to speak with more dignity and grace
 Quid$$ What again from the speeches of Caelius do we admire
 Ex Caelianis orationibus nempe eae placent , sive universae sive partes earum , in quibus nitorem et altitudinem horum temporum adgnoscimus$$ Why ,  we like of these the whole ,  or at least parts ,  in which we recognise the polish and elevation of our own day
 Sordes autem illae verborum et hians compositio et inconditi sensus redolent antiquitatem$$ but ,  as for those mean expressions ,  those gaps in the structure of the sentences ,  and uncouth sentiments ,  they savour of antiquity
 nec quemquam adeo antiquarium puto , ut Caelium ex ea parte laudet qua antiquus est$$ No one ,  I suppose ,  is so thoroughly antique as to praise Caelius simply on the side of his antiqueness
 Concedamus sane Gaius Caesari , ut propter magnitudinem cogitationum et occupationes rerum minus in eloquentia effecerit , quam divinum eius ingenium postulabat , tam hercule quam Brutum philosophiae suae relinquamus$$ We may ,  indeed ,  make allowance for Caius Julius Cæsar ,  on account of his vast schemes and many occupations ,  for having achieved less in eloquence than his divine genius demanded from him ,  and leave him indeed ,  just as we leave Brutus to his philosophy
 nam in orationibus minorem esse fama sua etiam admiratores eius fatentur$$ Undoubtedly in his speeches he fell short of his reputation ,  even by the admission of his admirers
 nisi forte quisquam aut Caesaris pro Decio Samnite aut Bruti pro Deiotaro rege ceterosque eiusdem lentitudinis ac teporis libros legit , nisi qui et carmina eorundem miratur$$ I hardly suppose that any one reads Cæsar's speech for Decius the Samnite ,  or that of Brutus for King Deiotarus ,  or other works equally dull and cold ,  unless it is some one who also admires their poems
 fecerunt enim et carmina et in bibliothecas rettulerunt , non melius quam Cicero , sed felicius , quia illos fecisse pauciores sciunt$$ For they did write poems ,  and sent them to libraries ,  with no better success than Cicero ,  but with better luck ,  because fewer people know that they wrote them
 Ad Ciceronem venio , cui eadem pugna cum aequalibus suis fuit , quae mihi vobiscum est$$ I come now to Cicero
 Illi enim antiquos mirabantur , ipse suorum temporum eloquentiam anteponebat$$ He had the same battle with his contemporaries which I have with you
 nec ulla re magis eiusdem aetatis oratores praecurrit quam iudicio$$ They admired the ancients
 primus enim excoluit orationem , primus et verbis dilectum adhibuit et compositioni artem , locos quoque laetiores attentavit et quasdam sententias invenit , utique in iis orationibus , quas senior iam et iuxta finem vitae composuit , id est , postquam magis profecerat usuque et experimentis didicerat quod optimum dicendi genus esset Nam priores eius orationes non carent vitiis antiquitatis$$ he preferred the eloquence of his own time It was in taste more than anything else that he was superior to the orators of that age In fact ,  he was the first who gave a finish to oratory ,  the first who applied a principle of selection to words ,  and art to composition He tried his skill at beautiful passages ,  and invented certain arrangements of the sentence ,  at least in those speeches which he composed when old and near the close of life ,  that is when he had made more progress ,  and had learnt by practice and by many a trial ,  what was the best style of speaking
 lentus est in principiis , longus in narrationibus , otiosus circa excessus$$ As for his early speeches ,  they are not free from the faults of antiquity
 tarde commovetur , raro incalescit$$ He is tedious in his introductions ,  lengthy in his narrations ,  careless about digressions
 pauci sensus apte et cum quodam lumine terminantur$$ he is slow to rouse himself ,  and seldom warms to his subject ,  and only an idea here and there is brought to a fitting and a brilliant close
 Nihil excerpere , nihil referre possis , et velut in rudi aedificio , firmus sane paries et duraturus , sed non satis expolitus et splendens$$ There is nothing which you can pick out or quote ,  and the style is like a rough building ,  the wall of which indeed is strong and lasting ,  but not particularly polished and bright
 Ego autem oratorem , sicut locupletem ac lautum patrem familiae , non eo tantum volo tecto tegi quod imbrem ac ventum arceat , sed etiam quod visum et oculos delectet$$ Now I would have an orator ,  like a rich and grand householder ,  not merely be sheltered by a roof sufficient to keep off rain and wind ,  but by one to delight the sight and the eye
 non ea solum instrui supellectile quae necessariis usibus sufficiat , sed sit in apparatu eius et aurum et gemmae , ut sumere in manus et aspicere saepius libeat$$ not merely be provided with such furniture as is enough for necessary purposes ,  but also possess among his treasures gold and jewels ,  so that he may find a frequent pleasure in handling them and gazing on them
 Quaedam vero procul arceantur ut iam oblitterata et olentia$$ On the other hand ,  some things should be kept at a distance as being now obsolete and ill-savoured
 nullum sit verbum velut rubigine infectum , nulli sensus tarda et inerti structura in morem annalium componantur$$ There should be no phrase stained ,  so to speak ,  with rust
 fugitet foedam et insulsam scurrilitatem , variet compositionem , nec omnis clausulas uno et eodem modo determinet$$ no ideas should be expressed in halting and languid periods after the fashion of chronicles
 Nolo inridere rotam Fortunae et ius verrinum et illud tertio quoque sensu in omnibus orationibus pro sententia positum esse videatur$$ Phrases like Fortune's wheel and Verrine soup ,  I do not care to ridicule ,  or that stock ending of every third clause in all Cicero's speeches ,  it would seem to be ,  brought in as the close of a period
 nam et haec invitus rettuli et plura omisi , quae tamen sola mirantur atque exprimunt ii , qui se antiquos oratores vocitant$$ I have mentioned them with reluctance ,  omitting several ,  although they are the sole peculiarities admired and imitated by those who call themselves orators of the old school
 Neminem nominabo , genus hominum significasse contentus$$ I will not name any one ,  as I think it enough to have pointed at a class
 sed vobis utique versantur ante oculos isti , qui Lucilium pro Horatio et Lucretium pro Virgilio legunt , quibus eloquentia Aufidii Bassi aut Servilii Noniani ex comparatione Sisennae aut Varronis sordet , qui rhetorum nostrorum commentarios fastidiunt , oderunt , Calvi mirantur$$ Still ,  you have before your eyes men who read Lucilius rather than Horace ,  and Lucretius rather than Virgil ,  who have a mean opinion of the eloquence of Aufidius Bassus ,  and Servilius Nonianus compared with that of Sisenna or Varro ,  and who despise and loathe the treatises of our modern rhetoricians ,  while those of Calvus are their admiration
 Quos more prisco apud iudicem fabulantis non auditores sequuntur , non populus audit , vix denique litigator perpetitur$$ When these men prose in the old style before the judges ,  they have neither select listeners nor a popular audience
 adeo maesti et inculti illam ipsam , quam iactant , sanitatem non firmitate , sed ieiunio consequuntur$$ in short the client himself hardly endures them
 porro ne in corpore quidem valetudinem medici probant quae animi anxietate contingit$$ They are dismal and uncouth ,  and the very soundness of which they boast ,  is the result not so much of real vigour as of fasting
 parum est aegrum non esse$$ Even as to health of body ,  physicians are not satisfied with that which is attained at the cost of mental worry
 fortem et laetum et alacrem volo$$ It is a small matter not to be ill
 prope abest ab infirmitate , in quo sola sanitas laudatur$$ I like a man to be robust and hearty and full of life
 Vos vero , viri disertissimi , ut potestis , ut facitis , inlustrate saeculum nostrum pulcherrimo genere dicendi$$ If soundness is all that you can praise him for ,  he is not very far from being an invalid
 Nam et te , Messalla , video laetissima quaeque antiquorum imitantem , et vos , Materne ac Secunde , ita gravitati sensuum nitorem et cultum verborum miscetis , ea electio inventionis , is ordo rerum , ea , quotiens causa poscit , ubertas , ea , quotiens permittit , brevitas , is compositionis decor , ea sententiarum planitas est , sic exprimitis adfectus , sic libertatem temperatis , ut etiam si nostra iudicia malignitas et invidia tardaverit , verum de vobis dicturi sint posteri nostri$$ Be it yours ,  my eloquent friends ,  to grace our age to the best of your ability ,  as in fact you are doing ,  with the noblest style of oratory You ,  Messala ,  imitate ,  I observe ,  the choicest beauties of the ancients And you ,  Maternus and Secundus ,  combine charm and finish of ex-pression with weight of thought There is discrimination in the phrases you invent ,  order in the treatment of your subject ,  fullness ,  when the case demands it ,  conciseness ,  when it is possible ,  elegance in your style ,  and perspicuity in every sentence
 Quae cum Aper dixisset , adgnoscitisne inquit Maternus vim et ardorem Apri nostri$$ Aper having finished speaking ,  Maternus said ,  You recognise ,  do you not ,  our friend Aper's force and passion
 Quo torrente , quo impetu saeculum nostrum defendit! Quam copiose ac varie vexavit antiquos! Quanto non solum ingenio ac spiritu , sed etiam eruditione et arte ab ipsis mutuatus est per quae mox ipsos incesseret! Tuum tamen , Messalla , promissum immutasse non debet$$ With what a torrent ,  what a rush of eloquence has he been defending our age How full and varied was his tirade against the ancients! What ability and spirit ,  what learning and skill too did he show in borrowing from the very men themselves the weapons with which he forthwith proceeded to attack them! Still ,  as to your promise ,  Messala ,  there must for all this be no change
 Neque enim defensorem antiquorum exigimus , nec quemquam nostrum , quamquam modo laudati sumus , iis quos insectatus est Aper comparamus$$ We neither want a defence of the ancients ,  nor do we compare any of ourselves ,  though we have just heard our own praises ,  with those whom Aper has denounced
 Ac ne ipse quidem ita sentit , sed more vetere et a nostris philosophis saepe celebrato sumpsit sibi contra dicendi partis$$ Aper himself thinks otherwise he merely followed an old practice much in vogue with your philosophical school of assuming the part of an opponent
 Igitur exprome nobis non laudationem antiquorum (satis enim illos fama sua laudat) , sed causas cur in tantum ab eloquentia eorum recesserimus , cum praesertim centum et viginti annos ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem effici ratio temporum collegerit$$ Give us then not a panegyric on the ancients (their own fame is a sufficient panegyric) but tell us plainly the reasons why with us there has been such a falling off from their eloquence ,  the more marked as dates have proved that from the death of Cicero to this present day is but a hundred and twenty years
 At parce inquit Maternus et potius exsolve promissum Neque enim hoc colligi desideramus , disertiores esse antiquos , quod apud me quidem in confesso est , sed causas exquirimus , quas te solitum tractare dixisti , paulo ante plane mitior et eloquentiae temporum nostrorum minus iratus , antequam te Aper offenderet maiores tuos lacessendo Non sum inquit offensus Apri mei disputatione , nec vos offendi decebit , si quid forte auris vestras perstringat , cum sciatis hanc esse eius modi sermonum legem , iudicium animi citra damnum adfectus proferre Perge inquit Maternus et cum de antiquis loquaris , utere antiqua libertate , a qua vel magis degeneravimus quam ab eloquentia$$ For my own part I shall not scruple to mention men by name ,  that ,  with examples before us ,  we may the more easily perceive the successive steps of the ruin and decay of eloquence
 Et Messalla non reconditas , Materne , causas requiris , nec aut tibi ipsi aut huic Secundo vel huic Apro ignotas , etiam si mihi partis adsignatis proferendi in medium quae omnes sentimus$$ Messala continued Far from obscure are the causes which you seek Neither to yourself or to our friends ,  Secundus and Aper ,  are they unknown ,  though you assign me the part of speaking out before you what we all think
 Quis enim ignorat et eloquentiam et ceteras artis descivisse ab illa vetere gloria non inopia hominum , sed desidia iuventutis et neglegentia parentum et inscientia praecipientium et oblivione moris antiqui$$ Who does not know that eloquence and all other arts have declined from their ancient glory ,  not from dearth of men ,  but from the indolence of the young ,  the carelessness of parents ,  the ignorance of teachers ,  and neglect of the old discipline
 Quae mala primum in urbe nata , mox per Italiam fusa , iam in provincias manant$$ The evils which first began in Rome soon spread through Italy ,  and are now diffusing themselves into the provinces
 Quamquam vestra vobis notiora sunt$$ But your provincial affairs are best known to yourselves
 ego de urbe et his propriis ac vernaculis vitiis loquar , quae natos statim excipiunt et per singulos aetatis gradus cumulantur , si prius de severitate ac disciplina maiorum circa educandos formandosque liberos pauca praedixero$$ I shall speak of Rome ,  and of those native and home-bred vices which take hold of us as soon as we are horn ,  and multiply with every stage of life ,  when I have first said a few words on the strict discipline of our ancestors in the education and training of children
 Nam pridem suus cuique filius , ex casta parente natus , non in cellula emptae nutricis , sed gremio ac sinu matris educabatur , cuius praecipua laus erat tueri domum et inservire liberis$$ Every citizen's son ,  the child of a chaste mother ,  was from the beginning reared ,  not in the chamber of a purchased nurse ,  but in that mother's bosom and embrace ,  and it was her special glory to study her home and devote herself to her children
 Eligebatur autem maior aliqua natu propinqua , cuius probatis spectatisque moribus omnis eiusdem familiae suboles committeretur$$ It was usual to select an elderly kinswoman of approved and esteemed character to have the entire charge of all the children of the household
 coram qua neque dicere fas erat quod turpe dictu , neque facere quod inhonestum factu videretur$$ In her presence it was the last offence to utter an unseemly word or to do a disgraceful act
 Ac non studia modo curasque , sed remissiones etiam lususque puerorum sanctitate quadam ac verecundia temperabat$$ With scrupulous piety and modesty she regulated not only the boy's studies and occupations ,  but even his recreations and games
 Sic Corneliam Gracchorum , sic Aureliam Caesaris , sic Atiam Augusti matrem praefuisse educationibus ac produxisse principes liberos accepimus$$ Thus it was ,  as tradition says ,  that the mothers of the Gracchi ,  of Cæsar ,  of Augustus ,  Cornelia ,  Aurelia ,  Atia ,  directed their children's education and reared the greatest of sons
 Quae disciplina ac severitas eo pertinebat , ut sincera et integra et nullis pravitatibus detorta unius cuiusque natura toto statim pectore arriperet artis honestas , et sive ad rem militarem sive ad iuris scientiam sive ad eloquentiae studium inclinasset , id solum ageret , id universum hauriret$$ The strictness of the discipline tended to form in each case a pure and virtuous nature which no vices could warp ,  and which would at once with the whole heart seize on every noble lesson Whatever its bias ,  whether to the soldier's or the lawyer's art ,  or to the study of eloquence ,  it would make that its sole aim ,  and imbibe it in its fullness
 At nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae , cui adiungitur unus aut alter ex omnibus servis , plerumque vilissimus nec cuiquam serio ministerio adcommodatus$$ But in our day we entrust the infant to a little Greek servant-girl who is attended by one or two ,  commonly the worst of all the slaves ,  creatures utterly unfit for any important work
 Horum fabulis et erroribus et virides teneri statim et rudes animi imbuuntur$$ Their stories and their prejudices from the very first fill the child's tender and uninstructed mind
 nec quisquam in tota domo pensi habet , quid coram infante domino aut dicat aut faciat$$ No one in the whole house cares what he says or does before his infant master
 Quin etiam ipsi parentes non probitati neque modestiae parvulos adsuefaciunt , sed lasciviae et dicacitati , per quae paulatim impudentia inrepit et sui alienique contemptus$$ Even parents themselves familiarise their little ones ,  not with virtue and modesty ,  but with jesting and glib talk ,  which lead on by degrees to shamelessness and to contempt for themselves as well as for others
 Iam vero propria et peculiaria huius urbis vitia paene in utero matris concipi mihi videntur , histrionalis favor et gladiatorum equorumque studia$$ Really I think that the characteristic and peculiar vices of this city ,  a liking for actors and a passion for gladiators and horses ,  are all but conceived in the mother's womb
 quibus occupatus et obsessus animus quantulum loci bonis artibus relinquit Quotum quemque invenies qui domi quicquam aliud loquatur Quos alios adulescentulorum sermones excipimus , si quando auditoria intravimus$$ When these occupy and possess the mind ,  how little room has it left for worthy attainments! Few indeed are to be found who talk of any other subjects in their homes ,  and whenever we enter a class-room ,  what else is the conversation of the youths
 Ne praeceptores quidem ullas crebriores cum auditoribus suis fabulas habent$$ Even with the teachers ,  these are the more frequent topics of talk with their scholars
 colligunt enim discipulos non severitate disciplinae nec ingenii experimento , sed ambitione salutationum et inlecebris adulationis$$ In fact ,  they draw pupils ,  not by strictness of discipline or by giving proof of ability ,  but by assiduous court and cunning tricks of flattery
 Transeo prima discentium elementa , in quibus et ipsis parum laboratur$$ I say nothing about the learners' first rudiments
 nec in auctoribus cognoscendis nec in evolvenda antiquitate nec in notitiam vel rerum vel hominum vel temporum satis operae insumitur$$ Even with these little pains are taken ,  and on the reading of authors ,  on the study of antiquity and a knowledge of facts ,  of men and of periods ,  by no means enough labour is bestowed
 Sed expetuntur quos rhetoras vocant$$ It is rhetoricians ,  as they are called ,  who are in request
 quorum professio quando primum in hanc urbem introducta sit quamque nullam apud maiores nostros auctoritatem habuerit , statim dicturus referam necesse est animum ad eam disciplinam , qua usos esse eos oratores accepimus , quorum infinitus labor et cotidiana meditatio et in omni genere studiorum assiduae exercitationes ipsorum etiam continentur libris$$ When this profession was first introduced into our city ,  and how little esteem it had among our ancestors ,  I am now about to explain but I will first recall your attention to the training which we have been told was practised by those orators whose infinite industry ,  daily study and incessant application to every branch of learning are seen in the contents of their own books
 Notus est vobis utique Ciceronis liber , qui Brutus inscribitur , in cuius extrema parte (nam prior commemorationem veterum oratorum habet) sua initia , suos gradus , suae eloquentiae velut quandam educationem refert$$ You are doubtless familiar with Cicero's book ,  called Brutus In the latter part of it (the first gives an account of the ancient orators) he relates his own beginnings ,  his progress ,  and the growth ,  so to say ,  of his eloquence
 se apud Quintus Nucium ius civile didicisse , apud Philonem Academicum , apud Diodotum Stoicum omnis philosophiae partis penitus hausisse$$ He tells us that he learnt the civil law under Quintus Mucius ,  and that he thoroughly imbibed every branch of philosophy under Philo of the Academy and under Diodotus the Stoic
 neque iis doctoribus contentum , quorum ei copia in urbe contigerat , Achaiam quoque et Asiam peragrasse , ut omnem omnium artium varietatem complecteretur$$ that not content with the teachers under whom he had had the opportunity of studying at Rome ,  he travelled through Achaia and Asia Minor so as to embrace every variety of every learned pursuit
 Itaque hercule in libris Ciceronis deprehendere licet , non geometriae , non musicae , non grammaticae , non denique ullius ingenuae artis scientiam ei defuisse$$ Hence we really find in Cicero's works that he was not deficient in the knowledge of geometry ,  music ,  grammar ,  or ,  in short ,  any liberal accomplishment
 Ille dialecticae subtilitatem , ille moralis partis utilitatem , ille rerum motus causasque cognoverat$$ The subtleties of logic ,  the useful lessons of ethical science ,  the movements and causes of the universe ,  were alike known to him
 Ita est enim , optimi viri , ita ex multa eruditione et plurimis artibus et omnium rerum scientia exundat et exuberat illa admirabilis eloquentia$$ The truth indeed is this ,  my excellent friends ,  that Cicero's wonderful eloquence wells up and overflows out of a store of erudition ,  a multitude of accomplishments ,  and a knowledge that was universal
 neque oratoris vis et facultas , sicut ceterarum rerum , angustis et brevibus terminis cluditur , sed is est orator , qui de omni quaestione pulchre et ornate et ad persuadendum apte dicere pro dignitate rerum , ad utilitatem temporum , cum voluptate audientium possit$$ The strength and power of oratory ,  unlike all other arts ,  is not confined within narrow and straitened limits ,  but the orator is he who can speak on every question with grace ,  elegance ,  and persuasiveness ,  suitably to the dignity of his subject ,  the requirements of the occasion ,  and the taste of his audience
 Nec quisquam respondeat sufficere , ut ad tempus simplex quiddam et uniforme doceamur primum enim aliter utimur propriis , aliter commodatis , longeque interesse manifestum est , possideat quis quae profert an mutuetur$$ Let no one reply that it is enough for us to learn ,  as occasion requires ,  some single and detached subject
 deinde ipsa multarum artium scientia etiam aliud agentis nos ornat , atque ubi minime credas , eminet et excellit Idque non doctus modo et prudens auditor , sed etiam populus intellegit ac statim ita laude prosequitur , ut legitime studuisse , ut per omnis eloquentiae numeros isse , ut denique oratorem esse fateatur$$ In the first place we use our own property in one way ,  a loan in another ,  and there is evidently a wide difference between possessing what one exhibits and borrowing it
 quem non posse aliter existere nec extitisse umquam confirmo , nisi eum qui , tamquam in aciem omnibus armis instructus , sic in forum omnibus artibus armatus exierit Quod adeo neglegitur ab horum temporum disertis , ut in actionibus eorum huius quoque cotidiani sermonis foeda ac pudenda vitia deprehendantur$$ Next ,  the very knowledge of many subjects sits gracefully on us ,  even when we are otherwise engaged ,  and makes itself visible and conspicuous where you would least expect it
 ut ignorent leges , non teneant senatus consulta , ius huius civitatis ultro derideant , sapientiae vero studium et praecepta prudentium penitus reformident In paucissimos sensus et angustas sententias detrudunt eloquentiam velut expulsam regno suo , ut quae olim omnium artium domina pulcherrimo comitatu pectora implebat , nunc circumcisa et amputata , sine apparatu , sine honore , paene dixerim sine ingenuitate , quasi una ex sordidissimis artificiis discatur Ergo hanc primam et praecipuam causam arbitror , cur in tantum ab eloquentia antiquorum oratorum recesserimus$$ Even the average citizen ,  and not only the learned and critical hearer ,  perceives it ,  and forthwith showers his praises in the acknowledgment that the man has been a genuine student ,  has gone through every branch of eloquence ,  and is ,  in short ,  an orator
 Si testes desiderantur , quos potiores nominabo quam apud Graecos Demosthenem , quem studiosissimum Platonis auditorem fuisse memoriae proditum est Et Cicero his , ut opinor , verbis refert , quidquid in eloquentia effecerit , id se non rhetorum officinis , sed Academiae spatiis consecutum Sunt aliae causae , magnae et graves , quas vobis aperiri aequum est , quoniam quidem ego iam meum munus explevi , et quod mihi in consuetudine est , satis multos offendi , quos , si forte haec audierint , certum habeo dicturos me , dum iuris et philosophiae scientiam tamquam oratori necessariam laudo , ineptiis meis plausisse$$ And I maintain that the only orator is ,  and ever has been ,  one who ,  like a soldier equipped at all points going to the battle-field ,  enters the forum armed with every learned accomplishment
 Et Maternus mihi quidem inquit susceptum a te munus adeo peregisse nondum videris , ut incohasse tantum et velut vestigia ac liniamenta quaedam ostendisse videaris$$ For myself ,  replied Maternus ,  I do not think that you have completed the task which you undertook
 Nam quibus artibus instrui veteres oratores soliti sint , dixisti differentiamque nostrae desidiae et inscientiae adversus acerrima et fecundissima eorum studia demonstrasti$$ Far from it You have ,  I think ,  only made a beginning ,  and indicated ,  so to say ,  its traces and outlines
 cetera exspecto , ut quem ad modum ex te didici , quid aut illi scierint aut nos nesciamus , ita hoc quoque cognoscam , quibus exercitationibus iuvenes iam et forum ingressuri confirmare et alere ingenia sua soliti sint Neque enim solum arte et scientia , sed longe magis facultate et usu eloquentiam contineri , nec tu puto abnues et hi significare vultu videntur$$ You have indeed described to us the usual equipment of the ancient orators ,  and pointed out the contrast presented by our idleness and ignorance to their very diligent and fruitful studies
 Deinde cum Aper quoque et Secundus idem adnuissent , Messalla quasi rursus incipiens$$ I want to hear the rest
 quoniam initia et semina veteris eloquentiae satis demonstrasse videor , docendo quibus artibus antiqui oratores institui erudirique soliti sint , persequar nunc exercitationes eorum Quamquam ipsis artibus inest exercitatio , nec quisquam percipere tot tam reconditas tam varias res potest , nisi ut scientiae meditatio , meditationi facultas , facultati usus eloquentiae accedat$$ Having learnt from you what they knew ,  with which we are unacquainted ,  I wish also to be told the process of training by which ,  when mere lads ,  and when about to enter the forum ,  they used to strengthen and nourish their intellects
 per quae colligitur eandem esse rationem et percipiendi quae proferas et proferendi quae perceperis Sed si cui obscuriora haec videntur isque scientiam ab exercitatione separat , illud certe concedet , instructum et plenum his artibus animum longe paratiorem ad eas exercitationes venturum , quae propriae esse oratorum videntur$$ For you will not ,  I imagine ,  deny that eloquence depends much less on art and theory than on capacity and practice ,  and our friends here seem by their looks to think the same
 Ergo apud maiores nostros iuvenis ille , qui foro et eloquentiae parabatur , imbutus iam domestica disciplina , refertus honestis studiis deducebatur a patre vel a propinquis ad eum oratorem , qui principem in civitate locum obtinebat$$ It was accordingly usual with our ancestors ,  when a lad was being prepared for public speaking ,  as soon as he was fully trained by home discipline ,  and his mind was stored with culture ,  to have him taken by his father ,  or his relatives to the orator who held the highest rank in the state
 Hunc sectari , hunc prosequi , huius omnibus dictionibus interesse sive in iudiciis sive in contionibus adsuescebat , ita ut altercationes quoque exciperet et iurgiis interesset utque sic dixerim , pugnare in proelio disceret$$ The boy used to accompany and attend him ,  and be present at all his speeches ,  alike in the law-court and the assembly ,  and thus he picked up the art of repartee ,  and became habituated to the strife of words ,  and indeed ,  I may almost say ,  learnt how to fight in battle
 Magnus ex hoc usus , multum constantiae , plurimum iudicii iuvenibus statim contingebat , in media luce studentibus atque inter ipsa discrimina , ubi nemo inpune stulte aliquid aut contrarie dicit , quo minus et iudex respuat et adversarius exprobret , ipsi denique advocati aspernentur$$ Thereby young men acquired from the first great experience and confidence ,  and a very large stock of discrimination ,  for they were studying in broad daylight ,  in the very thick of the conflict ,  where no one can say anything foolish or self-contradictory without its being refuted by the judge ,  or ridiculed by the opponent ,  or ,  last of all ,  repudiated by the very counsel with him
 Igitur vera statim et incorrupta eloquentia imbuebantur et quamquam unum sequerentur , tamen omnis eiusdem aetatis patronos in plurimis et causis et iudiciis cognoscebant$$ Thus from the beginning they were imbued with true and genuine eloquence ,  and ,  although they attached themselves to one pleader ,  still they became acquainted with all advocates of their own standing in a multitude of cases before the courts
 habebantque ipsius populi diversissimarum aurium copiam , ex qua facile deprehenderent , quid in quoque vel probaretur vel displiceret$$ They had too abundant experience of the popular ear in all its greatest varieties ,  and with this they could easily ascertain what was liked or disapproved in each speaker
 Ita nec praeceptor deerat , optimus quidem et electissimus , qui faciem eloquentiae , non imaginem praestaret , nec adversarii et aemuli ferro , non rudibus dimicantes , nec auditorium semper plenum , semper novum , ex invidis et faventibus , ut nec bene nec male dicta dissimularentur$$ Thus they were not in want of a teacher of the very best and choicest kind ,  who could show them eloquence in her true features ,  not in a mere resemblance nor did they lack opponents and rivals ,  who fought with actual steel ,  not with a wooden sword ,  and the audience too was always crowded ,  always changing ,  made up of unfriendly as well as of admiring critics ,  so that neither success nor failure could be disguised
 Scitis enim magnam illam et duraturam eloquentiae famam non minus in diversis subselliis parari quam suis$$ You know ,  of course ,  that eloquence wins its great and enduring fame quite as much from the benches of our opponents as from those of our friends
 inde quin immo constantius surgere , ibi fidelius corroborari$$ nay ,  more ,  its rise from that quarter is steadier ,  and its growth surer
 Atque hercule sub eius modi praeceptoribus iuvenis ille , de quo loquimur , oratorum discipulus , fori auditor , sectator iudiciorum , eruditus et adsuefactus alienis experimentis , cui cotidie audienti notae leges , non novi iudicum vultus , frequens in oculis consuetudo contionum , saepe cognitae populi aures , sive accusationem susceperat sive defensionem , solus statim et unus cuicumque causae par erat$$ Undoubtedly it was under such teachers that the youth of whom I am speaking ,  the disciple of orators ,  the listener in the forum ,  the student in the law-courts ,  was trained and practised by the experiences of others The laws he learnt by daily hearing the faces of the judges were familiar to him the ways of popular assemblies were continually before his eyes he had frequent experience of the ear of the people ,  and whether he undertook a prosecution or a defence ,  he was at once singly and alone equal to any case
 Nono decimo aetatis anno Lucius Crassus Gaius Carbonem , unoetvicesimo Caesar Dolabellam , altero et vicesimo Asinius Pollio Gaius Catonem , non multum aetate antecedens Calvus Vatinium iis orationibus insecuti sunt , quas hodieque cum admiratione legimus$$ We still read with admiration the speeches in which Lucius Crassus in his nineteenth ,  Cæsar and Asinius Pollio in their twenty-first year ,  Calvus ,  when very little older ,  denounced ,  respectively ,  Carbo ,  Dolabella ,  Cato ,  and Vatinius
 At nunc adulescentuli nostri deducuntur in scholas istorum , qui rhetores vocantur , quos paulo ante Ciceronis tempora extitisse nec placuisse maioribus nostris ex eo manifestum est , quod a Crasso et Domitio censoribus claudere , ut ait Cicero , ludum impudentiae iussi sunt$$ But in these days we have our youths taken to the professors' theatre ,  the rhetoricians ,  as we call them The class made its appearance a little before Cicero's time ,  and was not liked by our ancestors ,  as is evident from the fact that ,  when Crassus and Domitius were censors ,  they were ordered ,  as Cicero says ,  to close the school of impudence
 Sed ut dicere institueram , deducuntur in scholas , in quibus non facile dixerim utrumne locus ipse an condiscipuli an genus studiorum plus mali ingeniis adferant$$ However ,  as I was just saying ,  the boys are taken to schools in which it is hard to tell whether the place itself ,  or their fellow-scholars ,  or the character of their studies ,  do their minds most harm
 Nam in loco nihil reverentiae est , in quem nemo nisi aeque imperitus intret$$ As for the place ,  there is no such thing as reverence ,  for no one enters it who is not as ignorant as the rest
 in condiscipulis nihil profectus , cum pueri inter pueros et adulescentuli inter adulescentulos pari securitate et dicant et audiantur$$ As for the scholars ,  there can be no improvement ,  when boys and striplings with equal assurance ad ,  dress ,  and are addressed by ,  other boys and striplings
 ipsae vero exercitationes magna ex parte contrariae$$ As for the mental exercises themselves ,  they are the reverse of beneficial
 Nempe enim duo genera materiarum apud rhetoras tractantur , suasoriae et controversiae$$ Two kinds of subject-matter are dealt with before the rhetoricians ,  the persuasive and the controversial
 Ex his suasoriae quidem etsi tamquam plane leviores et minus prudentiae exigentes pueris delegantur , controversiae robustioribus adsignantur , quales , per fidem , et quam incredibiliter compositae! sequitur autem , ut materiae abhorrenti a veritate declamatio quoque adhibeatur$$ The persuasive ,  as being comparatively easy and requiring less skill ,  is given to boys The controversial is assigned to riper scholars ,  and ,  good heavens! what strange and astonishing productions are the result! It comes to pass that subjects remote from all reality are actually used for declamation
 Sic fit ut tyrannicidarum praemia aut vitiatarum electiones aut pestilentiae remedia aut incesta matrum aut quidquid in schola cotidie agitur , in foro vel raro vel numquam , ingentibus verbis persequantur$$ Thus the reward of a tyrannicide ,  or the choice of an outraged maiden ,  or a remedy for a pestilence ,  or a mother's incest ,  anything ,  in short ,  daily discussed in our schools ,  never ,  or but very rarely in the courts ,  is dwelt on in grand language
 $$ Great eloquence ,  like fire ,  grows with its material
 $$ it becomes fiercer with movement ,  and brighter as it burns
 $$ On this same principle was developed in our state too the eloquence of antiquity
 rem cogitant nihil humile , nihil abiectum eloqui poterat Magna eloquentia , sicut flamma , materia alitur et motibus excitatur et urendo clarescit Eadem ratio in nostra quoque civitate antiquorum eloquentiam provexit$$ Although even the modern orator has attained all that the circumstances of a settled ,  quiet ,  and prosperous community allow ,  still in the disorder and licence of the past more seemed to be within the reach of the speaker ,  when ,  amid a universal confusion that needed one guiding hand ,  he exactly adapted his wisdom to the bewildered people's capacity of conviction
 Nam etsi horum quoque temporum oratores ea consecuti sunt , quae composita et quieta et beata re publica tribui fas erat , tamen illa perturbatione ac licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur , cum mixtis omnibus et moderatore uno carentibus tantum quisque orator saperet , quantum erranti populo persuaderi poterat$$ Hence ,  laws without end and consequent popularity hence ,  speeches of magistrates who ,  I may say ,  passed nights on the Rostra hence ,  prosecutions of influential citizens brought to trial ,  and feuds transmitted to whole families hence ,  factions among the nobles ,  and incessant strife between the senate and the people
 Hinc leges assiduae et populare nomen , hinc contiones magistratuum paene pernoctantium in rostris , hinc accusationes potentium reorum et adsignatae etiam domibus inimicitiae , hinc procerum factiones et assidua senatus adversus plebem certamina$$ In each case the state was torn asunder ,  but the eloquence of the age was exercised and ,  as it seemed ,  was loaded with great rewards For the more powerful a man was as a speaker ,  the more easily did he obtain office ,  the more decisively superior was he to his colleagues in office ,  the more influence did he acquire with the leaders of the state ,  the more weight in the senate ,  the more notoriety and fame with the people
 Quae singula etsi distrahebant rem publicam , exercebant tamen illorum temporum eloquentiam et magnis cumulare praemiis videbantur , quia quanto quisque plus dicendo poterat , tanto facilius honores adsequebatur , tanto magis in ipsis honoribus collegas suos anteibat , tanto plus apud principes gratiae , plus auctoritatis apud patres , plus notitiae ac nominis apud plebem parabat$$ Such men had a host of clients ,  even among foreign nations the magistrates ,  when leaving Rome for the provinces ,  showed them respect ,  and courted their favour as soon as they returned The prætorship and the consulship seemed to offer themselves to them ,  and even when they were out of office ,  they were not out of power ,  for they swayed both people and senate with their counsels and influence
 Hi clientelis etiam exterarum nationum redundabant , hos ituri in provincias magistratus reverebantur , hos reversi colebant , hos et praeturae et consulatus vocare ultro videbantur , hi ne privati quidem sine potestate erant , cum et populum et senatum consilio et auctoritate regerent$$ Indeed ,  they had quite convinced themselves that without eloquence no one could win or retain a distinguished and eminent position in the state And no wonder Even against their own wish they had to show themselves before the people It was little good for them to give a brief vote in the senate without sup-porting their opinion with ability and eloquence
 Quin immo sibi ipsi persuaserant neminem sine eloquentia aut adsequi posse in civitate aut tueri conspicuum et eminentem locum$$ If brought into popular odium ,  or under some charge ,  they had to reply in their own words
 Nec mirum , cum etiam inviti ad populum producerentur , cum parum esset in senatu breviter censere , nisi qui ingenio et eloquentia sententiam suam tueretur , cum in aliquam invidiam aut crimen vocati sua voce respondendum haberent , cum testimonia quoque in publicis iudiciis non absentes nec per tabellam dare , sed coram et praesentes dicere cogerentur$$ Again ,  they were under the necessity of giving evidence in the public courts ,  not in their absence by affidavit ,  but of being present and of speaking it openly There was thus a strong stimulus to win the great prizes of eloquence ,  and as the reputation of a good speaker was considered an honour and a glory ,  so it was thought a disgrace to seem mute and speechless
 Ita ad summa eloquentiae praemia magna etiam necessitas accedebat , et quo modo disertum haberi pulchrum et gloriosum , sic contra mutum et elinguem videri deforme habebatur$$ Shame therefore quite as much as hope of reward prompted men not to take the place of a pitiful client rather than that of a patron ,  or to see hereditary connections transferred to others ,  or to seem spiritless and incapable of office from either failing to obtain it or from holding it weakly when obtained
 Transeo ad formam et consuetudinem veterum iudiciorum$$ I pass now to the forms and character of procedure in the old courts
 Quae etsi nunc aptior est ita erit , eloquentiam tamen illud forum magis exercebat , in quo nemo intra paucissimas horas perorare cogebatur et liberae comperendinationes erant et modum in dicendo sibi quisque sumebat et numerus neque dierum neque patronorum finiebatur$$ As they exist now ,  they are indeed more favourable to truth ,  but the forum in those days was a better training for eloquence There no speaker was under the necessity of concluding within a very few hours there was freedom of adjournment ,  and every one fixed for himself the limits of his speech ,  and there was no prescribed number of days or of counsel
 primus haec tertio consulatu Gnaeus Pompeius adstrinxit imposuitque veluti frenos eloquentiae , ita tamen ut omnia in foro , omnia legibus , omnia apud praetores gererentur$$ It was Cneius Pompeius who ,  in his third consulship ,  first restricted all this ,  and put a bridle ,  so to say ,  on eloquence ,  intending ,  however ,  that all business should be transacted in the forum according to law ,  and before the prætors
 apud quos quanto maiora negotia olim exerceri solita sint , quod maius argumentum est quam quod causae centumvirales , quae nunc primum obtinent locum , adeo splendore aliorum iudiciorum obruebantur , ut neque Ciceronis neque Caesaris neque Bruti neque Caelii neque Calvi , non denique ullius magni oratoris liber apud centumviros dictus legatur , exceptis orationibus Asinii , quae pro heredibus Urbiniae inscribuntur , ab ipso tamen Pollione mediis divi Augusti temporibus habitae , postquam longa temporum quies et continuum populi otium et assidua senatus tranquillitas et maxime principis disciplina ipsam quoque eloquentiam sicut omnia alia pacaverat$$ Here is a stronger proof of the greater importance of the cases tried before these judges than in the fact that causes in the Court of the Hundred ,  causes which now hold the first place ,  were then so eclipsed by the fame of other trials that not a speech of Cicero ,  or Cæsar ,  or Brutus ,  or Caelius ,  or Calvus ,  or ,  in short ,  any great orator is now read ,  that was delivered in that Court ,  except only the orations of Asinius Pollio for the heirs of Urbinia ,  as they are entitled ,  and even Pollio delivered these in the middle of the reign of Augustus ,  a period of long rest ,  of unbroken repose for the people and tranquillity for the senate ,  when the emperor's perfect discipline had put its restraints on eloquence as well as on all else
 Iam vero contiones assiduae et datum ius potentissimum quemque vexandi atque ipsa inimicitiarum gloria , cum se plurimi disertorum ne a Publio quidem Scipione aut Lucius Sulla aut Gnaeus Pompeio abstinerent , et ad incessendos principes viros , ut est natura invidiae , populi quoque ut histriones auribus uterentur , quantum ardorem ingeniis , quas oratoribus faces admovebant$$ Again ,  what stimulus to genius and what fire to the orator was furnished by incessant popular assemblies ,  by the privilege of attacking the most influential men ,  and by the very glory of such feuds when most of the good speakers did not spare even a Publius Scipio ,  or a Sulla ,  or a Cneius Pompeius ,  and following the common impulse of envy availed themselves of the popular ear for invective against eminent citizens
 Non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur et quae probitate et modestia gaudeat , sed est magna illa et notabilis eloquentia alumna licentiae , quam stulti libertatem vocitant , comes seditionum , effrenati populi incitamentum , sine obsequio , sine severitate , contumax , temeraria , adrogans , quae in bene constitutis civitatibus non oritur$$ I am not speaking of a quiet and peaceful accomplishment ,  which delights in what is virtuous and well regulated No the great and famous eloquence of old is the nursling of the licence which fools called freedom it is the companion of sedition ,  the stimulant of an unruly people ,  a stranger to obedience and subjection ,  a defiant ,  reckless ,  presumptuous thing which does not show itself in a well-governed state
 Quem enim oratorem Lacedaemonium , quem Cretensem accepimus$$ What orator have we ever heard of at Sparta or at Crete
 Quarum civitatum severissima disciplina et severissimae leges traduntur$$ A very strict discipline and very strict laws prevailed ,  tradition says ,  in both those states
 Ne Macedonum quidem ac Persarum aut ullius gentis , quae certo imperio contenta fuerit , eloquentiam novimus$$ Nor do we know of the existence of eloquence among the Macedonians or Persians ,  or in any people content with a settled government
 Rhodii quidam , plurimi Athenienses oratores extiterunt , apud quos omnia populus , omnia imperiti , omnia , ut sic dixerim , omnes poterant$$ There were some orators at Rhodes and a host of them at Athens ,  but there the people ,  there any ignorant fellow ,  anybody ,  in short ,  could do anything
 Nostra quoque civitas , donec erravit , donec se partibus et dissensionibus et discordiis confecit , donec nulla fuit in foro pax , nulla in senatu concordia , nulla in iudiciis moderatio , nulla superiorum reverentia , nullus magistratuum modus , tulit sine dubio valentiorem eloquentiam , sicut indomitus ager habet quasdam herbas laetiores$$ So too our own state ,  while it went astray and wore out its strength in factious strife and discord ,  with neither peace in the forum ,  unity in the senate ,  order in the courts ,  respect for merit ,  or seemly behaviour in the magistrates ,  produced beyond all question a more vigorous eloquence ,  just as an untilled field yields certain herbage in special plenty
 Sed nec tanti rei publicae Gracchorum eloquentia fuit , ut pateretur et leges , nec bene famam eloquentiae Cicero tali exitu pensavit$$ Still the eloquence of the Gracchi was not an equivalent to Rome for having to endure their legislation ,  and Cicero's fame as an orator was a poor compensation for the death he died
 Sic quoque quod superest antiquis oratoribus fori non emendatae nec usque ad votum compositae civitatis argumentum est$$ And so now the forum ,  which is all that our speakers have left them of antiquity ,  is an evidence of a state not thoroughly reformed or as orderly as we could wish
 Quis enim nos advocat nisi aut nocens aut miser$$ Who but the guilty or unfortunate apply to us
 Quod municipium in clientelam nostram venit , nisi quod aut vicinus populus aut domestica discordia agitat$$ What town puts itself under our protection but one harassed by its neighbours or by strife at home
 Quam provinciam tuemur nisi spoliatam vexatamque$$ When we plead for a province ,  is it not one that has been plundered and ill-treated
 Atqui melius fuisset non queri quam vindicari$$ Surely it would be better not to complain than to have to seek redress
 Quod si inveniretur aliqua civitas , in qua nemo peccaret , supervacuus esset inter innocentis orator sicut inter sanos medicus$$ Could a community be found in which no one did wrong ,  an orator would be as superfluous among its innocent people as a physician among the healthy
 Quo modo tamen minimum usus minimumque profectus ars medentis habet in iis gentibus , quae firmissima valetudine ac saluberrimis corporibus utuntur , sic minor oratorum honor obscuriorque gloria est inter bonos mores et in obsequium regentis paratos$$ As the healing art is of very little use and makes very little progress in nations which enjoy particularly robust constitutions and vigorous frames ,  so the orator gets an inferior and less splendid renown where a sound morality and willing obedience to authority prevail
 Quid enim opus est longis in senatu sententiis , cum optimi cito consentiant Quid multis apud populum contionibus , cum de re publica non imperiti et multi deliberent , sed sapientissimus et unus$$ What need there of long speeches in the senate ,  when the best men are soon of one mind ,  or of endless harangues to the people ,  when political questions are decided not by an ignorant multitude ,  but by one man of pre-eminent wisdom
 Quid voluntariis accusationibus , cum tam raro et tam parce peccetur Quid invidiosis et excedentibus modum defensionibus , cum clementia cognoscentis obviam periclitantibus eat credite , optimi et in quantum opus est disertissimi viri , si aut vos prioribus saeculis aut illi , quos miramur , his nati essent , ac deus aliquis vitas ac vestra tempora repente mutasset , nec vobis summa illa laus et gloria in eloquentia neque illis modus et temperamentum defuisset$$ What need of voluntary prosecutions ,  when crimes are so rare and slight ,  or of defences full of spiteful insinuation and exceeding proper bounds ,  when the clemency of the judge offers itself to the accused in his peril
