<start> et Pompei Crassique potentia cito in Caesarem , Lepidi atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere , qui cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa nomine principis sub imperium accepit . <end>$$<start> who , when the world was wearied by civil strife , subjected it to empire under the title of Prince . <end>
<start> sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversa claris scriptoribus memorata sunt . <end>$$<start> But the successes and reverses of the old Roman people have been recorded by famous historians . <end>
<start> temporibusque Augusti dicendis non defuere decora ingenia , donec gliscente adulatione deterrerentur . <end>$$<start> and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of Augustus , till growing sycophancy scared them away . <end>
<start> Tiberii Gaique et Claudii ac Neronis res florentibus ipsis ob metum falsae , postquam occiderant , recentibus odiis compositae sunt . <end>$$<start> The histories of Tiberius , Caius , Claudius , and Nero , while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred . <end>
<start> Postquam Bruto et Cassio caesis nulla iam publica arma , Pompeius apud Siciliam oppressus exutoque Lepido , interfecto Antonio ne Iulianis quidem partibus nisi Caesar dux reliquus , posito triumviri nomine consulem se ferens et ad tuendam plebem tribunicio iure contentum , ubi militem donis , populum annona , cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit , insurgere paulatim , munia senatus magistratuum legum in se trahere , nullo adversante , cum ferocissimi per acies aut proscriptione cecidissent , ceteri nobilium , quanto quis servitio promptior , opibus et honoribus extollerentur ac novis ex rebus aucti tuta et praesentia quam vetera et periculosa mallent . <end>$$<start> When after the destruction of Brutus and Cassius there was no longer any army of the Commonwealth , when Pompeius was crushed in Sicily , and when , with Lepidus pushed aside and Antonius slain , even the Julian faction had only Caesar left to lead it , then , dropping the title of triumvir , and giving out that he was a Consul , and was satisfied with a tribune's authority for the protection of the people , Augustus won over the soldiers with gifts , the populace with cheap corn , and all men with the sweets of repose , and so grew greater by degrees , while he concentrated in himself the functions of the Senate , the magistrates , and the laws . <end>
<start> Ceterum Augustus subsidia dominationi Claudium Marcellum sororis filium admodum adulescentem pontificatu et curuli aedilitate , Marcus Agrippam ignobilem loco , bonum militia et victoriae socium , geminatis consulatibus extulit , mox defuncto Marcello generum sumpsit . <end>$$<start> Augustus meanwhile , as supports to his despotism , raised to the pontificate and curule aedileship Claudius Marcellus , his sister's son , while a mere stripling , and Marcus Agrippa , of humble birth , a good soldier , and one who had shared his victory , to two consecutive consulships , and as Marcellus soon afterwards died , he also accepted him as his son-in-law . <end>
<start> nam genitos Agrippa Gaium ac Lucium in familiam Caesarum induxerat , necdum posita puerili praetexta principes iuventutis appellari , destinari consules specie recusantis flagrantissime cupiverat . <end>$$<start> For she had gained such a hold on the aged Augustus that he drove out as an exile into the island of Planasia , his only grandson , Agrippa Postumus , who , though devoid of worthy qualities , and having only the brute courage of physical strength , had not been convicted of any gross offence . <end>
<start> ut Agrippa vita concessit , Lucium Caesarem euntem ad Hispaniensis exercitus , Gaium remeantem Armenia et vulnere invalidum mors fato propera vel novercae Liviae dolus abstulit , Drusoque pridem extincto Nero solus e privignis erat , illuc cuncta vergere filius , collega imperii , consors tribuniciae potestatis adsumitur omnisque per exercitus ostentatur , non obscuris , ut antea , matris artibus , sed palam hortatu . <end>$$<start> And yet Augustus had appointed Germanicus , Drusus's offspring , to the command of eight legions on the Rhine , and required Tiberius to adopt him , although Tiberius had a son , now a young man , in his house . <end>
<start> at hercule Germanicum Druso ortum octo apud Rhenum legionibus inposuit adscirique per adoptionem a Tiberio iussit , quamquam esset in domo Tiberii filius iuvenis , sed quo pluribus munimentis insisteret . <end>$$<start> He had no war at the time on his hands except against the Germans , which was rather to wipe out the disgrace of the loss of Quintilius Varus and his army than out of an ambition to extend the empire , or for any adequate recompense . <end>
<start> Igitur verso civitatis statu nihil usquam prisci et integri moris omnes exuta aequalitate iussa principis aspectare , nulla in praesens formidine , dum Augustus aetate validus seque et domum in pacem sustentavit . <end>$$<start> Thus the State had been revolutionised , and there was not a vestige left of the old sound morality Stript of equality , all looked up to the commands of a sovereign without the least apprehension for the present , while Augustus in the vigour of life , could maintain his own position , that of his house , and the general tranquillity . <end>
<start> postquam provecta iam senectus aegro et corpore fatigabatur , aderatque finis et spes novae , pauci bona libertatis in cassum disserere , plures bellum pavescere , alii cupere . <end>$$<start> When in advanced old age , he was worn out by a sickly frame , and the end was near and new prospects opened , a few spoke in vain of the blessings of freedom , but most people dreaded and some longed for war . <end>
<start> pars multo maxima inminentis dominos variis rumoribus differebant trucem Agrippam et ignominia accensum non aetate neque rerum experientia tantae moli parem , Tiberium Neronem maturum annis , spectatum bello , set vetere atque insita Claudiae familiae superbia , multaque indicia saevitiae , quamquam premantur , erumpere . <end>$$<start> The popular gossip of the large majority fastened itself variously on their future masters Agrippa was savage , and had been exasperated by insult , and neither from age nor experience in affairs was equal to so great a burden . <end>
<start> accedere matrem muliebri inpotentia serviendum feminae duobusque insuper adulescentibus , qui rem publicam interim premant , quandoque distrahant . <end>$$<start> They must , it seemed , be subject to a female and to two striplings besides , who for a while would burden , and some day rend asunder the State . <end>
<start> Haec atque talia agitantibus gravescere valetudo Augusti , et quidam scelus uxoris suspectabant . <end>$$<start> While these and like topics were discussed , the infirmities of Augustus increased , and some suspected guilt on his wife's part . <end>
<start> quippe rumor incesserat , paucos ante menses Augustum , electis consciis et comite uno Fabio Maximo , Planasiam vectum ad visendum Agrippam . <end>$$<start> For a rumour had gone abroad that a few months before he had sailed to Planasia on a visit to Agrippa , with the knowledge of some chosen friends , and with one companion , Fabius Maximus . <end>
<start> multas illic utrimque lacrimas et signa caritatis spemque ex eo fore ut iuvenis penatibus avi redderetur quod Maximum uxori Marciae aperuisse , illam Liviae . <end>$$<start> that many tears were shed on both sides , with expressions of affection , and that thus there was a hope of the young man being restored to the home of his grandfather . <end>
<start> gnarum id Caesari neque multo post extincto Maximo , dubium an quaesita morte , auditos in funere eius Marciae gemitus semet incusantis , quod causa exitii marito fuisset . <end>$$<start> This , it was said , Maximus had divulged to his wife Marcia , she again to Livia . <end>
<start> acribus namque custodiis domum et vias saepserat Livia , laetique interdum nuntii vulgabantur , donec provisis quae tempus monebat simul excessisse Augustum et rerum potiri Neronem fama eadem tulit . <end>$$<start> For Livia had surrounded the house and its approaches with a strict watch , and favourable bulletins were published from time to time , till , provision having been made for the demands of the crisis , one and the same report told men that Augustus was dead and that Tiberius Nero was master of the State . <end>
<start> Primum facinus novi principatus fuit Postumi Agrippae caedes , quem ignarum inerumumque quamvis firmatus animo centurio aegre confecit . <end>$$<start> The first crime of the new reign was the murder of Postumus Agrippa . <end>
<start> nihil de ea re Tiberius apud senatum disseruit patris iussa simulabat , quibus praescripsisset tribuno custodiae adposito , ne cunctaretur Agrippam morte adficere , quandoque ipse supremum diem explevisset . <end>$$<start> Tiberius gave no explanation of the matter to the Senate he pretended that there were directions from his father ordering the tribune in charge of the prisoner not to delay the slaughter of Agrippa , whenever he should himself have breathed his last . <end>
<start> multa sine dubio saevaque Augustus de moribus adulescentis questus , ut exilium eius senatus consulto sanciretur perfecerat ceterum in nullius umquam suorum necem duravit , neque mortem nepoti pro securitate privigni inlatam credibile erat . <end>$$<start> Beyond a doubt , Augustus had often complained of the young man's character , and had thus succeeded in obtaining the sanction of a decree of the Senate for his banishment . <end>
<start> propius vero Tiberium ac Liviam , illum metu , hanc novercalibus odiis , suspecti et invisi iuvenis caedem festinavisse . <end>$$<start> But he never was hard-hearted enough to destroy any of his kinsfolk , nor was it credible that death was to be the sentence of the grandson in order that the stepson might feel secure . <end>
<start> At Romae ruere in servitium consules , patres , eques . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile at Rome people plunged into slavery - consuls , senators , knights . <end>
<start> quanto quis inlustrior , tanto magis falsi ac festinantes , vultuque composito , ne laeti excessu principis neu tristiores primordio , lacrimas gaudium , questus adulationem miscebant . <end>$$<start> The higher a man's rank , the more eager his hypocrisy , and his looks the more carefully studied , so as neither to betray joy at the decease of one emperor nor sorrow at the rise of another , while he mingled delight and lamentations with his flattery . <end>
<start> Nam Tiberius cuncta per consules incipiebat , tamquam vetere re publica et ambiguus imperandi ne edictum quidem , quo patres in curiam vocabat , nisi tribuniciae potestatis praescriptione posuit sub Augusto acceptae . <end>$$<start> As soon , however , as Augustus was dead , he had given the watchword to the praetorian cohorts , as commander-in-chief . <end>
<start> excubiae , arma , cetera aulae . <end>$$<start> soldiers went with him to the Senate House . <end>
<start> causa praecipua ex formidine , ne Germanicus , in cuius manu tot legiones , immensa sociorum auxilia , mirus apud populum favor , habere imperium quam exspectare mallet . <end>$$<start> He looked also at public opinion , wishing to have the credit of having been called and elected by the State rather than of having crept into power through the intrigues of a wife and a dotard's adoption . <end>
<start> dabat et famae , ut vocatus electusque potius a re publica videretur quam per uxorium ambitum et senili adoptione inrepsisse . <end>$$<start> It was subsequently understood that he assumed a wavering attitude , to test likewise the temper of the nobles . <end>
<start> postea cognitum est ad introspiciendas etiam procerum voluntates inductam dubitationem nam verba vultus in crimen detorquens recondebat . <end>$$<start> For he would twist a word or a look into a crime and treasure it up in his memory . <end>
<start> Nihil primo senatus die agi passus est nisi de supremis Augusti , cuius testamentum inlatum per virgines Vestae Tiberium et Liviam heredes habuit . <end>$$<start> On the first day of the Senate he allowed nothing to be discussed but the funeral of Augustus , whose will , which was brought in by the Vestal Virgins , named as his heirs Tiberius and Livia . <end>
<start> legata non ultra civilem modum , nisi quod opulo et plebi quadringentiens triciens quinquiens , praetoriarum cohortium militibus singula nummum milia , urbanis quingenos , legionariis aut cohortibus civium Romanorum trecenos nummos viritim dedit . <end>$$<start> Of these the most imposing were thought fitting The procession was to be conducted through the gate of triumph , on the motion of Gallus Asinius . <end>
<start> ex quis qui maxime insignes visi , ut porta triumphali duceretur funus , Gallus Asinius , ut legum latarum tituli , victarum ab eo gentium vocabula anteferentur , Lucius Arruntius censuere . <end>$$<start> Messala Valerius further proposed that the oath of allegiance to Tiberius should be yearly renewed , and when Tiberius asked him whether it was at his bidding that he had brought forward this motion , he replied that he had proposed it spontaneously , and that in whatever concerned the State he would use only his own discretion , even at the risk of offending . <end>
<start> addebat Messalla Valerius renovandum per annos sacramentum in nomen Tiberii . <end>$$<start> This was the only style of adulation which yet remained . <end>
<start> die funeris milites velut praesidio stetere , multum inridentibus qui ipsi vierant quique a parentibus acceperant diem illum crudi adhuc servitii et libertatis inprospere repetitae , cum occisus dictator Caesar aliis pessimum , aliis pulcherrimum facinus videretur nunc senem principem , longa potentia , provisis etiam heredum in rem publicam opibus , auxilio scilicet militari tuendum , ut sepultura eius quieta foret . <end>$$<start> Now , they said , an aged sovereign , whose power had lasted long , who had provided his heirs with abundant means to coerce the State , requires forsooth the defence of soldiers that his burial may be undisturbed . <end>
<start> Multus hinc ipso de Augusto sermo , plerisque vana mirantibus , quod idem dies accepti quondam imperii princeps et vitae supremus , quod Nolae in domo et cubiculo in quo pater eius Octavius vitam finivisset . <end>$$<start> Then followed much talk about Augustus himself , and many expressed an idle wonder that the same day marked the beginning of his assumption of empire and the close of his life , and , again , that he had ended his days at Nola in the same house and room as his father Octavius . <end>
<start> hi pietate erga parentem et necessitudine rei publicae , in qua nullus tunc legibus locus ad arma civilia actum , quae neque parari possent neque haberi per bonas artes . <end>$$<start> He had often yielded to Antonius , while he was taking vengeance on his father's murderers , often also to Lepidus . <end>
<start> postquam hic socordia senuerit , ille per libidines pessum datus sit , non aliud discordantis patriae remedium fuisse quam ut ab uno regeretur . <end>$$<start> Yet the State had been organized under the name neither of a kingdom nor a dictatorship , but under that of a prince . <end>
<start> non regno tamen neque dictatura , sed principis nomine constitutam rem publicam . <end>$$<start> The ocean and remote rivers were the boundaries of the empire . <end>
<start> mari Oceano aut amnibus longinquis saeptum imperium . <end>$$<start> the legions , provinces , fleets , all things were linked together . <end>
<start> legiones , provincias , classes , cuncta inter se conexa . <end>$$<start> there was law for the citizens . <end>
<start> ius apud cives , modestiam apud socios . <end>$$<start> there was respect shown to the allies . <end>
<start> urbem ipsam magnificio ornatu . <end>$$<start> The capital had been embellished on a grand scale . <end>
<start> Dicebatur contra pietatem erga parentem et tempora rei publicae obtentui sumpta ceterum cupidine dominandi concitos per largitionem veteranos , paratum ab adulescente privato exercitum , corruptas consulis legiones , simulatam Pompeianarum gratiam partium . <end>$$<start> It was said , on the other hand , that filial duty and State necessity were merely assumed as a mask It was really from a lust of sovereignty that he had excited the veterans by bribery , had , when a young man and a subject , raised an army , tampered with the Consul's legions , and feigned an attachment to the faction of Pompeius . <end>
<start> post Antonium , Tarentino Brundisinoque foedere et nuptiis sororis inlectum , subdolae adfinitatis poenas morte exsolvisse . <end>$$<start> there were the disasters of Lollius and Varus , the murders at Rome of the Varros , Egnatii , and Juli . <end>
<start> nec domesticis abstinebatur abducta Neroni uxor et consulti per ludibrium pontifices an concepto necdum edito partu rite nuberet . <end>$$<start> Nero's wife had been taken from him , and there had been the farce of consulting the pontiffs , whether , with a child conceived and not yet born , she could properly marry . <end>
<start> Quintus +Tedii+ et Vedii Pollionis luxus . <end>$$<start> There were the excesses of Quintus Tedius and Vedius Pollio . <end>
<start> postremo Livia gravis in rem publicam mater , gravis domui Caesarum noverca . <end>$$<start> last of all , there was Livia , terrible to the State as a mother , terrible to the house of the Caesars as a stepmother . <end>
<start> nihil deorum honoribus relictum , cum se templis et effigie numinum per flamines et sacerdotes coli vellet . <end>$$<start> No honour was left for the gods , when Augustus chose to be himself worshipped with temples and statues , like those of the deities , and with flamens and priests . <end>
<start> ne Tiberium quidem caritate aut rei publicae cura successorem adscitum , sed quoniam adrogantiam saevitiamque eius introspexerit , comparatione deterrima sibi gloriam quaesivisse . <end>$$<start> He had not even adopted Tiberius as his successor out of affection or any regard to the State , but , having thoroughly seen his arrogant and savage temper , he had sought glory for himself by a contrast of extreme wickedness . <end>
<start> etenim Augustus paucis ante annis , cum Tiberio tribuniciam potestatem a patribus rursum postularet , quamquam honora oratione quaedam de habitu cultuque et institutis eius iecerat , quae velut excusando exprobraret . <end>$$<start> For , in fact , Augustus , a few years before , when he was a second time asking from the Senate the tribunitian power for Tiberius , though his speech was complimentary , had thrown out certain hints as to his manners , style , and habits of life , which he meant as reproaches , while he seemed to excuse . <end>
<start> ceterum sepultura more perfecta templum et caelestes religiones decernuntur . <end>$$<start> However , when his obsequies had been duly performed , a temple with a religious ritual was decreed him . <end>
<start> Versae inde ad Tiberium preces . <end>$$<start> After this all prayers were addressed to Tiberius . <end>
<start> et ille varie diserebat de magnitudine imperii sua modestia . <end>$$<start> He , on his part , urged various considerations , the greatness of the empire , his distrust of himself . <end>
<start> solam divi Augusti mentem tantae molis capacem se in partem curarum ab illo vocatum experiendo didicisse quam arduum , quam subiectum fortunae regendi cuncta onus . <end>$$<start> Only , he said , the intellect of the Divine Augustus was equal to such a burden . <end>
<start> proinde in civitate tot inlustribus viris subnixa non ad unum omnia deferrent plures facilius munia rei publicae sociatis laboribus exsecuturos . <end>$$<start> Called as he had been by him to share his anxieties , he had learnt by experience how exposed to fortune's caprices was the task of universal rule . <end>
<start> Tiberioque etiam in rebus quas non occuleret , seu natura sive adsuetudine , suspensa semper et obscura verba tunc vero nitenti ut sensus suos penitus abderet , in incertum et ambiguum magis implicabantur . <end>$$<start> Tiberius's language even in matters which he did not care to conceal , either from nature or habit , was always hesitating and obscure , and now that he was struggling to hide his feelings completely , it was all the more involved in uncertainty and doubt . <end>
<start> at patres , quibus unus metus si intellegere viderentur , in questus lacrimas vota effundi . <end>$$<start> The Senators , however , whose only fear was lest they might seem to understand him , burst into complaints , tears , and prayers . <end>
<start> ad deos , ad effigiem Augusti , ad genua ipsius o manus tendere , cum proferri libellum recitarique iussit . <end>$$<start> They raised their hands to the gods , to the statue of Augustus , and to the knees of Tiberius , when he ordered a document to be produced and read . <end>
<start> opes publicae continebantur , quantum civium sociorumque in armis , quot classes , regna , provinciae , tributa aut vectigalia , et necessitates ac largitiones . <end>$$<start> This contained a description of the resources of the State , of the number of citizens and allies under arms , of the fleets , subject kingdoms , provinces , taxes , direct and indirect , necessary expenses and customary bounties . <end>
<start> quae cuncta sua manu perscripserat Augustus addideratque consilium coercendi intra terminos imperii , incertum metu an per invidiam . <end>$$<start> All these details Augustus had written with his own hand , and had added a counsel , that the empire should be confined to its present limits , either from fear or out of jealousy . <end>
<start> Inter quae senatu ad infimas obtestationes procumbente , dixit forte Tiberius se ut non toti rei publicae parem , ita quaecumque pars sibi mandaretur eius tutelam suscepturum . <end>$$<start> Meantime , while the Senate stooped to the most abject supplication , Tiberius happened to say that although he was not equal to the whole burden of the State , yet he would undertake the charge of whatever part of it might be intrusted to him . <end>
<start> tum Asinius Gallus interrogo inquit , Caesar , quam partem rei publicae mandari tibi velis . <end>$$<start> Thereupon Asinius Gallus said , I ask you , Caesar , what part of the State you wish to have intrusted to you . <end>
<start> perculsus inprovisa interrogatione paulum reticuit dein collecto animo respondit nequaquam decorum pudori suo legere aliquid aut evitare ex eo cui in universum excusari mallet . <end>$$<start> Confounded by the sudden inquiry he was silent for a few moments then , recovering his presence of mind , he replied that it would by no means become his modesty to choose or to avoid in a case where he would prefer to be wholly excused . <end>
<start> rursum Gallus (etenim vultu offensionem coniectaverat) non idcirco interrogatum ait , ut divideret quae separari nequirent sed ut sua confessione argueretur unum esse rei publicae corpus atque unius animo regendum . <end>$$<start> Then Gallus again , who had inferred anger from his looks , said that the question had not been asked with the intention of dividing what could not be separated , but to convince him by his own admission that the body of the State was one , and must be directed by a single mind . <end>
<start> addidit laudem de Augusto Tiberiumque ipsum victoriarum suarum quaeque in toga per tot annos egregie fecisset admonuit . <end>$$<start> He further spoke in praise of Augustus , and reminded Tiberius himself of his victories , and of his admirable deeds for many years as a civilian . <end>
<start> nec ideo iram eius lenivit , pridem invisus , tamquam ducta in matrimonium Vipsania Marcus Agrippae filia , quae quondam Tiberii uxor filerat , plus quam civilia agitaret Pollionisque Asinii patris foreciam retineret . <end>$$<start> Still , he did not thereby soften the emperor's resentment , for he had long been detested from an impression that , as he had married Vipsania , daughter of Marcus Agrippa , who had once been the wife of Tiberius , he aspired to be more than a citizen , and kept up the arrogant tone of his father , Asinius Pollio . <end>
<start> Post quae Lucius Arruntius haud multum discrepans a Galli oratione perinde offendit , quamquam Tiberio nulla vetus in Arruntium ira sed divitem , promptum , artibus egregiis et pari fama publice , suspectabat . <end>$$<start> Next , Lucius Arruntius , who differed but little from the speech of Gallus , gave like offence , though Tiberius had no old grudge against him , but simply mistrusted him , because he was rich and daring , had brilliant accomplishments , and corresponding popularity . <end>
<start> quippe Augustus supremis sermonibus cum tractaret quinam adipisci principem locum suffecturi abnuerent aut inpares vellent vel idem possent cuperentque , M Lepidum dixerat capacem sed aspernantem , Gallum Asinium avidum et minorem , Lucius Arruntium non indignum et si casus daretur ausurum . <end>$$<start> For Augustus , when in his last conversations he was discussing who would refuse the highest place , though sufficiently capable , who would aspire to it without being equal to it , and who would unite both the ability and ambition , had described Marcus Lepidus as able but contemptuously indifferent , Gallus Asinius as ambitious and incapable , Lucius Arruntius as not unworthy of it , and , should the chance be given him , sure to make the venture . <end>
<start> de prioribus consentitur , pro Arruntio quidam Gnaeus Pisonem tradidere omnesque praeter Lepidum variis mox criminibus struente Tiberio circumventi sunt . <end>$$<start> About the two first there is a general agreement , but instead of Arruntius some have mentioned Cneius Piso , and all these men , except Lepidus , were soon afterwards destroyed by various charges through the contrivance of Tiberius . <end>
<start> etiam Quintus Haterius et Mamercus Scaurus suspicacem animum perstrinxere , Haterius cum dixis set quo usque patieris , Caesar , non adesse caput rei publicae . <end>$$<start> Quintus Haterius too and Mamercus Scaurus ruffled his suspicious temper , Haterius by having said - How long , Caesar , will you suffer the State to be without a head . <end>
<start> Scaurus quia dixerat spem esse ex eo non inritas fore senatus preces quod relationi consulum iure tribuniciae potestatis non intercessisset . <end>$$<start> Scaurus by the remark that there was a hope that the Senate's prayers would not be fruitless , seeing that he had not used his right as Tribune to negative the motion of the Consuls . <end>
<start> in Haterium statim invectus est . <end>$$<start> Tiberius instantly broke out into invective against Haterius . <end>
<start> Scaurum , cui inplacabilius irascebatur , silentio tramisit . <end>$$<start> Scaurus , with whom he was far more deeply displeased , he passed over in silence . <end>
<start> fessusque clamore omnium , expostulatione singulorum flexit paulatim , non ut fateretur suscipi a se imperium , sed ut negare et rogari desineret . <end>$$<start> Wearied at last by the assembly's clamorous importunity and the urgent demands of individual Senators , he gave way by degrees , not admitting that he undertook empire , but yet ceasing to refuse it and to be entreated . <end>
<start> constat Haterium , cum deprecandi causa Palatium introisset ambulantisque Tiberii genua advolveretur , prope a militibus interfectum quia Tiberius casu an manibus eius inpeditus prociderat . <end>$$<start> It is known that Haterius having entered the palace to ask pardon , and thrown himself at the knees of Tiberius as he was walking , was almost killed by the soldiers , because Tiberius fell forward , accidentally or from being entangled by the suppliant's hands . <end>
<start> neque tamen periculo talis viri mitigatus est , donec Haterius Augustam oraret eiusque curatissimis precibus protegeretur . <end>$$<start> Yet the peril of so great a man did not make him relent , till Haterius went with entreaties to Augusta , and was saved by her very earnest intercessions . <end>
<start> Multa patrum et in Augustam adulatio . <end>$$<start> Great too was the Senate's sycophancy to Augusta . <end>
<start> quo minus idem pro Druso postularetur , ea causa quod designatus consul Drusus praesensque erat . <end>$$<start> But for Germanicus Caesar he asked pro-consular powers , and envoys were despatched to confer them on him , and also to express sympathy with his grief at the death of Augustus . <end>
<start> candidatos praeturae duodecim nominavit , numerum ab Augusto traditum . <end>$$<start> The same request was not made for Drusus , because he was consul elect and present at Rome . <end>
<start> Tum primum e campo comitia ad patres translata sunt nam ad eam diem , etsi potissima arbitrio principis , quaedam tamen studiis tribuum fiebant . <end>$$<start> It was then for the first time that the elections were transferred from the Campus Martius to the Senate . <end>
<start> neque populus ademptum ius questus est nisi inani rumore , et senatus largitionibus ac precibus sordidis exsolutus libens tenuit , moderante Tiberio ne plures quam quattuor candidatos commendaret sine repulsa et ambitu designandos . <end>$$<start> For up to that day , though the most important rested with the emperor's choice , some were settled by the partialities of the tribes . <end>
<start> sed decreta pecunia ex aerario , utque per circum triumphali veste uterentur curru vehi haud permissum . <end>$$<start> Money was , however , voted from the exchequer , and though the use of the triumphal robe in the circus was prescribed , it was not allowed them to ride in a chariot . <end>
<start> mox celebratio annua ad praetorem translata cui inter civis et peregrinos iurisdictio evenisset . <end>$$<start> Soon the annual celebration was transferred to the praetor , to whose lot fell the administration of justice between citizens and foreigners . <end>
<start> Hic rerum urbanarum status erat , cum Pannonicas legiones seditio incessit , nullis novis causis nisi quod mutatus princeps licentiam turbarum et ex civili bello spem praemiorum ostendebat . <end>$$<start> This was the state of affairs at Rome when a mutiny broke out in the legions of Pannonia , which could be traced to no fresh cause except the change of emperors and the prospect it held out of license in tumult and of profit from a civil war . <end>
<start> castris aestivis tres simul legiones habebantur , praesidente Iunio Blaeso , qui fine Augusti et initiis Tiberii auditis ob iustitium aut gaudium intermiserat solita munia . <end>$$<start> In the summer camp three legions were quartered , under the command of Junius Blaesus , who on hearing of the death of Augustus and the accession of Tiberius , had allowed his men a rest from military duties , either for mourning or rejoicing . <end>
<start> eo principio lascivire miles , discordare , pessimi cuiusque sermonibus praebere auris , denique luxum et otium cupere , disciplinam et laborem aspernari . <end>$$<start> This was the beginning of demoralization among the troops , of quarreling , of listening to the talk of every pestilent fellow , in short , of craving for luxury and idleness and loathing discipline and toil . <end>
<start> erat in castris Percennius quidam , dux olim theatralium operarum , dein gregarius miles , procax lingua et miscere coetus histrionali studio doctus . <end>$$<start> In the camp was one Percennius , who had once been a leader of one of the theatrical factions , then became a common soldier , had a saucy tongue , and had learnt from his applause of actors how to stir up a crowd . <end>
<start> is imperitos animos et quaenam post Augustum militiae condicio ambigentis inpellere paulatim nocturnis conloquiis aut flexo in vesperam die et dilapsis melioribus deterrimum quemque congregare . <end>$$<start> By working on ignorant minds , which doubted as to what would be the terms of military service after Augustus , this man gradually influenced them in conversations at night or at nightfall , and when the better men had dispersed , he gathered round him all the worst spirits . <end>
<start> Postremo promptis iam et aliis seditionis ministris velut contionabundus interrogabat cur paucis centurionibus paucioribus tribunis in modum servorum oboedirent . <end>$$<start> At last , when there were others ready to be abettors of a mutiny , he asked , in the tone of a demagogue , why , like slaves , they submitted to a few centurions and still fewer tribunes . <end>
<start> quando ausuros exposcere remedia , nisi novum et nutantem adhuc principem precibus vel armis adirent . <end>$$<start> When , he said , will you dare to demand relief , if you do not go with your prayers or arms to a new and yet tottering throne . <end>
<start> satis per tot annos ignavia peccatum , quod tricena aut quadragena stipendia senes et plerique truncato ex vulneribus corpore tolerent . <end>$$<start> We have blundered enough by our tameness for so many years , in having to endure thirty or forty campaigns till we grow old , most of us with bodies maimed by wounds . <end>
<start> ne dimissis quidem finem esse militiae , sed apud vexillum tendentis alio vocabulo eosdem labores perferre . <end>$$<start> Even dismissal is not the end of our service , but , quartered under a legion's standard we toil through the same hardships under another title . <end>
<start> ac si quis tot casus vita superaverit , trahi adhuc diversas in terras ubi per nomen agrorum uligines paludum vel inculta montium accipiant . <end>$$<start> If a soldier survives so many risks , he is still dragged into remote regions where , under the name of lands , he receives soaking swamps or mountainous wastes . <end>
<start> enimvero militiam ipsam gravem , infructuosam denis in diem assibus animam et corpus aestimari hinc vestem arma tentoria , hinc saevitiam centurionum et vacationes munerum redimi . <end>$$<start> Assuredly , military service itself is burdensome and unprofitable ten ases a day is the value set on life and limb . <end>
<start> at hercule verbera et vulnera , duram hiemem , exercitas aestates , bellum atrox aut sterilem pacem sempiterna . <end>$$<start> out of this , clothing , arms , tents , as well as the mercy of centurions and exemptions from duty have to be purchased . <end>
<start> nec aliud levamentum quam si certis sub legibus militia iniretur , ut singulos denarios mererent , sextus decumus stipendii annus finem adferret , ne ultra sub vexillis tenerentur , sed isdem in castris praemium pecunia solveretur . <end>$$<start> But indeed of floggings and wounds , of hard winters , wearisome summers , of terrible war , or barren peace , there is no end . <end>
<start> non obtrectari a se urbanas excubias sibi tamen apud horridas gentis e contuberniis hostem aspici . <end>$$<start> still , here amid barbarous tribes we have to face the enemy from our tents . <end>
<start> Adstrepebat vulgus , diversis incitamentis , hi verberum notas , illi canitiem , plurimi detrita tegmina et nudum corpus exprobrantes . <end>$$<start> The throng applauded from various motives , some pointing with indignation to the marks of the lash , others to their grey locks , and most of them to their threadbare garments and naked limbs . <end>
<start> postremo eo furoris venere ut tres legiones miscere in unam agitaverint . <end>$$<start> At , last , in their fury they went so far as to propose to combine the three legions into one . <end>
<start> depulsi aemulatione , quia suae quisque legioni eum honorem quaerebant , alio vertunt atque una tres aquilas et signa cohortium locant . <end>$$<start> Driven from their purpose by the jealousy with which every one sought the chief honour for his own legion , they turned to other thoughts , and set up in one spot the three eagles , with the ensigns of the cohorts . <end>
<start> simul congerunt caespites , exstruunt tribunal , quo magis conspicua sedes foret . <end>$$<start> At the same time they piled up turf and raised a mound , that they might have a more conspicuous meeting-place . <end>
<start> properantibus Blaesus advenit , increpabatque ac retinebat singulos , clamitans mea potius caede imbuite manus leviore flagitio legatum interficietis quam ab imperatore desciscitis . <end>$$<start> Amid the bustle Blaesus came up He upbraided them and held back man after man with the exclamation , Better imbrue your hands in my blood : it will be less guilt to slay your commander than it is to be in revolt from the emperor . <end>
<start> aut incolumis fidem legionum retinebo aut iugulatus paenitentiam adcelerabo . <end>$$<start> Either living I will uphold the loyalty of the legions , or pierced to the heart I will hasten on your repentance . <end>
<start> Aggerabatur nihilo minus caespes iamque pectori usque adcreverat , cum tandem pervicacia victi inceptum omisere . <end>$$<start> None the less however was the mound piled up , and it was quite breast high when , at last overcome by his persistency , they gave up their purpose . <end>
<start> Blaesus multa dicendi arte non per seditionem et turbas desideria militum ad Caesarem ferenda ait , neque veteres ab imperatoribus priscis neque ipsos a divo Augusto tam nova petivisse . <end>$$<start> Blaesus , with the consummate tact of an orator , said , It is not through mutiny and tumult that the desires of the army ought to be communicated to Caesar , nor did our soldiers of old ever ask so novel a boon of ancient commanders , nor have you yourselves asked it of the Divine Augustus . <end>
<start> et parum in tempore incipientis principis curas onerari . <end>$$<start> It is far from opportune that the emperor's cares , now in their first beginning , should be aggravated . <end>
<start> si tamen tenderent in pace temptare quae ne civilium quidem bellorum victores expostulaverint cur contra morem obsequii , contra fas disciplinae vim meditentur . <end>$$<start> If , however , you are bent upon attempting in peace what even after your victory in the civil wars you did not demand , why , contrary to the habit of obedience , contrary to the law of discipline , do you meditate violence . <end>
<start> decernerent legatos seque coram mandata darent . <end>$$<start> Decide on sending envoys , and give them instructions in your presence . <end>
<start> adclamavere ut filius Blaesi tribunus legatione ea fungeretur peteretque militibus missionem ab sedecim annis cetera mandaturos ubi prima provenissent . <end>$$<start> It was carried by acclamation that the son of Blaesus , one of the tribunes , should undertake the mission , and demand for the soldiers release from service after sixteen years . <end>
<start> Interea manipuli ante coeptam seditionem Nauportum missi ob itinera et pontes et alios usus , postquam turbatum in castris accepere , vexilla convellunt direptisque proximis vicis ipsoque Nauporto , quod municipii instar erat , retinentis centuriones inrisu et contumeliis , postremo verberibus insectantur , praecipua in Aufidienum Rufum praefectum castrorum ira , quem dereptum vehiculo sarcinis gravant aguntque primo in agmine per ludibrium rogitantes an tam immensa onera , tam longa itinera libenter ferret . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile the companies which previous to the mutiny had been sent to Nauportus to make roads and bridges and for other purposes , when they heard of the tumult in the camp , tore up the standards , and having plundered the neighbouring villages and Nauportus itself , which was like a town , assailed the centurions who restrained them with jeers and insults , last of all , with blows . <end>
<start> Horum adventu redintegratur seditio et vagi circumiecta populabantur . <end>$$<start> On the arrival of these troops the mutiny broke out afresh , and straggling from the camp they plundered the neighbourhood . <end>
<start> Blaesus paucos , maxime praeda onustos , ad terrorem ceterorum adfici verberibus , claudi carcere iubet . <end>$$<start> Blaesus ordered a few who had conspicuously loaded themselves with spoil to be scourged and imprisoned as a terror to the rest . <end>
<start> nam etiam tum legato a centurionibus et optimo quoque manipularium parebatur . <end>$$<start> for , even as it then was , the commander was still obeyed by the centurions and by all the best men among the soldiers . <end>
<start> illi obniti trahentibus , prensare circumstantium genua , ciere modo nomina singulorum , modo centuriam quisque cuius manipularis erat , cohortem , legionem , eadem omnibus inminere clamitantes . <end>$$<start> As the men were dragged off , they struggled violently , clasped the knees of the bystanders , called to their comrades by name , or to the company , cohort , or legion to which they respectively belonged , exclaiming that all were threatened with the same fate . <end>
<start> simul probra in legatum cumulant , caelum ac deos obtestantur , nihil reliqui faciunt quo minus invidiam misericordiam metum et iras permoverent . <end>$$<start> At the same time they heaped abuse on the commander they appealed to heaven and to the gods , and left nothing undone by which they might excite resentment and pity , alarm and rage . <end>
<start> adcurritur ab universis , et carcere effracto solvunt vincula desertoresque ac rerum capitalium damnatos sibi iam miscent . <end>$$<start> They all rushed to the spot , broke open the guardhouse , unbound the prisoners , and were in a moment fraternising with deserters and men convicted on capital charges . <end>
<start> Flagrantior inde vis , plures seditioni duces . <end>$$<start> Thence arose a more furious outbreak , with more leaders of the mutiny . <end>
<start> et Vibulenus quidam gregarius miles , ante tribunal Blaesi adlevatus circumstantium umeris , apud turbatos et quid pararet intentos vos quidem inquit his innocentibus et miserrimis lucem et spiritum reddidistis sed quis fratri meo vitam , quis fratrem mihi reddit . <end>$$<start> Vibulenus , a common soldier , was hoisted in front of the general's tribunal on the shoulders of the bystanders and addressed the excited throng , who eagerly awaited his intentions . <end>
<start> quem missum ad vos a Germanico exercitu de communibus commodis nocte proxima iugulavit per gladiatores suos , quos in exitium militum habet atque armat . <end>$$<start> You have indeed , he said , restored light and air to these innocent and most unhappy men , but who restores to my brother his life , or my brother to myself . <end>
<start> cum osculis , cum lacrimis dolorem meum implevero , me quoque trucidari iube , dum interfectos nullum ob scelus sed quia utilitati legionum consulebamus hi sepeliant . <end>$$<start> When , with embraces and tears , I have sated my grief , order me also to be slain , provided only that when we have been destroyed for no crime , but only because we consulted the good of the legions , we may be buried by these men around me . <end>
<start> Incendebat haec fletu et pectus atque os manibus verberans . <end>$$<start> He inflamed their excitement by weeping and smiting his breast and face with his hands . <end>
<start> mox disiectis quorum per umeros sustinebatur , praeceps et singulorum pedibus advolutus tantum consternationis invidiaeque concivit , ut pars militum gladiatores , qui e servitio Blaesi erant , pars ceteram eiusdem familiam vincirent , alii ad quaerendum corpus effunderentur . <end>$$<start> Then , hurling aside those who bore him on their shoulders , and impetuously flinging himself at the feet of one man after another , he roused such dismay and indignation that some of the soldiers put fetters on the gladiators who were among the number of Blaesus's slaves , others did the like to the rest of his household , while a third party hurried out to look for the corpse . <end>
<start> ac ni propere neque corpus ullum reperiri , et servos adhibitis cruciatibus abnuere caedem , neque illi fuisse umquam fratrem pernotuisset , haud multum ab exitio legati aberant . <end>$$<start> And had it not quickly been known that no corpse was found , that the slaves , when tortures were applied , denied the murder , and that the man never had a brother , they would have been on the point of destroying the general . <end>
<start> tribunos tamen ac praefectum castrorum extrusere , sarcinae fugientium direptae , et centurio Lucilius interficitur cui militaribus facetiis vocabulum cedo alteram indiderant , quia fracta vite in tergo militis alteram clara voce ac rursus aliam poscebat . <end>$$<start> As it was , they thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect they plundered the baggage of the fugitives , and they killed a centurion , Lucilius , to whom , with soldiers' humour , they had given the name Bring another , because when he had broken one vine-stick on a man's back , he would call in a loud voice for another and another . <end>
<start> ceteros latebrae texere , uno retento Clemente Iulio qui perferendis militum mandatis habebatur idoneus ob promptum ingenium . <end>$$<start> The rest sheltered themselves in concealment , and one only was detained , Clemens Julius , whom the soldiers considered a fit person to carry messages , from his ready wit . <end>
<start> quin ipsae inter se legiones octava et quinta decuma ferrum parabant , dum centurionem cognomento Sirpicum illa morti deposcit , quintadecumani tuentur , ni miles nonanus preces et adversum aspernantis minas interiecisset . <end>$$<start> Two legions , the eighth and the fifteenth , were actually drawing swords against each other , the former demanding the death of a centurion , whom they nicknamed Sirpicus , while the men of the fifteenth defended him , but the soldiers of the ninth interposed their entreaties , and when these were disregarded , their menaces . <end>
<start> Haec audita quamquam abstrusum et tristissima quaeque maxime occultantem Tiberium perpulere , ut Drusum filium cum primoribus civitatis duabusque praetoriis cohortibus mitteret , nullis satis certis mandatis , ex re consulturum . <end>$$<start> This intelligence had such an effect on Tiberius , close as he was , and most careful to hush up every very serious disaster , that he despatched his son Drusus with the leading men of the State and with two praetorian cohorts , without any definite instructions , to take suitable measures . <end>
<start> et cohortes delecto milite supra solitum firmatae . <end>$$<start> The cohorts were strengthened beyond their usual force with some picked troops . <end>
<start> additur magna pars praetoriani equitis et robora Germanorum , qui tum custodes imperatori aderant . <end>$$<start> There was in addition a considerable part of the Praetorian cavalry , and the flower of the German soldiery , which was then the emperor's guard . <end>
<start> simul praetorii praefectus Aelius Seianus , collega Straboni patri suo datus , magna apud Tiberium auctoritate , rector iuveni et ceteris periculorum praemiorumque ostentator . <end>$$<start> With them too was the commander of the praetorians , Aelius Sejanus , who had been associated with his own father , Strabo , had great influence with Tiberius , and was to advise and direct the young prince , and to hold out punishment or reward to the soldiers . <end>
<start> Druso propinquanti quasi per officium obviae fuere legiones , non laetae , ut adsolet , neque insignibus fulgentes , sed inluvie deformi et vultu , quamquam maestitiam imitarentur contumaciae propiores . <end>$$<start> When Drusus approached , the legions , as a mark of respect , met him , not as usual , with glad looks or the glitter of military decorations , but in unsightly squalor , and faces which , though they simulated grief , rather expressed defiance . <end>
<start> Postquam vallum introiit , portas stationibus firmant , globos armatorum certis castrorum locis opperiri iubent ceteri tribunal ingenti agmine circumveniunt . <end>$$<start> As soon as he entered the entrenchments , they secured the gates with sentries , and ordered bodies of armed men to be in readiness at certain points of the camp . <end>
<start> stabat Drusus silentium manu poscens . <end>$$<start> The rest crowded round the general's tribunal in a dense mass . <end>
<start> illi quoties oculos ad multitudinem rettulerant , vocibus truculentis strepere , rursum viso Caesare trepidare . <end>$$<start> Drusus stood there , and with a gesture of his hand demanded silence . <end>
<start> diversis animorum motibus pavebant terrebantque . <end>$$<start> There was a confused hum , a fierce shouting , and a sudden lull . <end>
<start> misisse interim filium ut sine cunctatione concederet quae statim tribui possent . <end>$$<start> that , as soon as his mind had recovered from its grief , he would lay their demands before the Senators . <end>
<start> Responsum est a contione mandata Clementi centurioni quae perferret . <end>$$<start> The crowd replied that they had delivered their instructions to Clemens , one of the centurions , which he was to convey to Rome . <end>
<start> is orditur de missione a sedecim annis , de praemiis finitae militiae , ut denarius diurnum stipendium foret , ne veterani sub vexillo haberentur . <end>$$<start> When Drusus pleaded in answer reference to the Senate and to his father , he was interrupted by a tumultuous shout . <end>
<start> ad ea Drusus cum arbitrium senatus et patris obtenderet , clamore turbatur . <end>$$<start> Why had he come , neither to increase the soldiers' pay , nor to alleviate their hardships , in a word , with no power to better their lot . <end>
<start> cur venisset neque augendis militum stipendiis neque adlevandis laboribus , denique nulla bene faciendi licentia . <end>$$<start> Yet heaven knew that all were allowed to scourge and to execute . <end>
<start> novum id plane quod imperator sola militis commoda ad senatum reiciat . <end>$$<start> Was then the same Senate to be consulted whenever notice was given of an execution or of a battle . <end>
<start> Postremo deserunt tribunal , ut quis praetorianorum militum amicorumve Caesaris occurreret , manus intentantes , causam discordiae et initium armorum , maxime infensi Gnaeus Lentulo , quod is ante alios aetate et gloria belli firmare Drusum credebatur et illa militiae flagitia primus aspernari . <end>$$<start> At last they deserted the general's tribunal , and to any praetorian soldier or friend of Caesar's who met them , they used those threatening gestures which are the cause of strife and the beginning of a conflict , with special rage against Cneius Lentulus , because they thought that he above all others , by his age and warlike renown , encouraged Drusus , and was the first to scorn such blots on military discipline . <end>
<start> nec multo post digredientem cum Caesare ac provisu periculi hiberna castra repetentem circumsistunt , rogitantes quo pergeret , ad imperatorem an ad patres , ut illic quoque commodis legionum adversaretur . <end>$$<start> Soon after , as he was leaving with Drusus to betake himself in foresight of his danger to the winter camp , they surrounded him , and asked him again and again whither he was going . <end>
<start> iamque lapidis ictu cruentus et exitii certus adcursu multitudinis quae cum Druso advenerat protectus est . <end>$$<start> And now , bleeding from a blow , and feeling destruction certain , he was rescued by the hurried arrival of the throng which had accompanied Drusus . <end>
<start> Noctem minacem et in scelus erupturam fors lenivit nam luna claro repente caelo visa languescere . <end>$$<start> That terrible night which threatened an explosion of crime was tranquillised by a mere accident . <end>
<start> et postquam ortae nubes offecere visui creditumque conditam tenebris , ut sunt mobiles ad superstitionem perculsae semel mentes , sibi aeternum laborem portendi , sua facinora aversari deos lamentantur . <end>$$<start> When clouds arose and obstructed their sight , and it was thought she was buried in the gloom , with that proneness to superstition which steals over minds once thoroughly cowed , they lamented that this was a portent of never-ending hardship , and that heaven frowned on their deeds . <end>
<start> utendum inclinatione ea Caesar et quae casus obtulerat in sapientiam vertenda ratus circumiri tentoria iubet . <end>$$<start> Drusus , thinking that he ought to avail himself of this change in their temper and turn what chance had offered to a wise account , ordered the tents to be visited . <end>
<start> accitur centurio Clemens et si alii bonis artibus grati in vulgus . <end>$$<start> Clemens , the centurion was summoned with all others who for their good qualities were liked by the common soldiers . <end>
<start> hi vigiliis , stationibus , custodiis portarum se inserunt , spem offerunt , metum intendunt . <end>$$<start> These men made their way among the patrols , sentries and guards of the camp-gates , suggesting hope or holding out threats . <end>
<start> quo usque filium imperatoris obsidebimus . <end>$$<start> How long will you besiege the emperor's son . <end>
<start> quis certaminum finis . <end>$$<start> What is to be the end of our strifes . <end>
<start> Percennius et Vibulenus stipendia militibus , agros emeritis largientur . <end>$$<start> In a word , are they , instead of the Neros and the Drusi , to control the empire of the Roman people . <end>
<start> denique pro Neronibus et Drusis imperium populi Romani capessent . <end>$$<start> Why are we not rather first in our repentance as we were last in the offence . <end>
<start> quin potius , ut novissimi in culpam , ita primi ad paenitentiam sumus . <end>$$<start> Demands made in common are granted slowly . <end>
<start> tarda sunt quae in commune expostulantur privatam gratiam statim mereare , statim recipias . <end>$$<start> a separate favour you may deserve and receive at the same moment . <end>
<start> legionem a legione dissociant . <end>$$<start> Then by degrees the instinct of obedience returned . <end>
<start> tum redire paulatim amor obsequii omittunt portas , signa unum in locum principio seditionis congregata suas in sedes referunt . <end>$$<start> They quitted the gates and restored to their places the standards which at the beginning of the mutiny they had grouped into one spot . <end>
<start> Drusus orto die et vocata contione , quamquam rudis dicendi , nobilitate ingenita incusat priora , probat praesentia . <end>$$<start> At daybreak Drusus called them to an assembly , and , though not a practised speaker , yet with natural dignity upbraided them for their past and commended their present behaviour . <end>
<start> negat se terrore et minis vinci flexos ad modestiam si videat , si supplices audiat , scripturum patri ut placatus legionum preces exciperet . <end>$$<start> He was not , he said , to be conquered by terror or by threats Were he to see them inclining to submission and hear the language of entreaty , he would write to his father , that he might be merciful and receive the legions' petition . <end>
<start> orantibus rursum idem Blaesus et Lucius Aponius , eques Romanus e cohorte Drusi , Iustusque Catonius , primi ordinis centurio , ad Tiberium mittuntur . <end>$$<start> At their prayer , Blaesus and Lucius Apronius , a Roman knight on Drusus's staff , with Justus Catonius , a first-rank centurion , were again sent to Tiberius . <end>
<start> promptum ad asperiora ingenium Druso erat vocatos Vibulenum et Percennium interfici iubet . <end>$$<start> He summoned Vibulenus and Percennius and ordered them to be put to death . <end>
<start> tradunt plerique intra tabernaculum ducis obrutos , alii corpora extra vallum abiecta ostentui . <end>$$<start> The common account is that they were buried in the general's tent , though according to some their bodies were flung outside the entrenchments for all to see . <end>
<start> Tum ut quisque praecipuus turbator conquisiti , et pars , extra castra palantes , a centurionibus aut praetoriarum cohortium militibus caesi quosdam ipsi manipuli documentum fidei tradidere . <end>$$<start> Search was then made for all the chief mutineers Some as they roamed outside the camp were cut down by the centurions or by soldiers of the praetorian cohorts . <end>
<start> auxerat militum curas praematura hiems imbribus continuis adeoque saevis , ut non egredi tentoria , congregari inter se , vix tutari signa possent , quae turbine atque unda raptabantur . <end>$$<start> And there still lingered the dread of the divine wrath nor was it without meaning , they thought , that , hostile to an impious host , the stars grew dim and storms burst over them . <end>
<start> durabat et formido caelestis irae , nec frustra adversus impios hebescere sidera , ruere tempestates non aliud malorum levamentum , quam si linquerent castra infausta temerataque et soluti piaculo suis quisque hibernis redderentur . <end>$$<start> Their only relief from misery was to quit an ill-omened and polluted camp , and , having purged themselves of their guilt , to betake themselves again every one to his winterquarters . <end>
<start> et Drusus non exspectato legatorum regressu , quia praesentia satis conse derant , in urbem rediit . <end>$$<start> Drusus , without awaiting the envoys' return , as for the present all was quiet , went back to Rome . <end>
<start> Isdem ferme diebus isdem causis Germanicae legiones turbatae , quanto plures tanto violentius , et magna spe fore ut Germanicus Caesar imperium alterius pati nequiret daretque se legionibus vi sua cuncta tracturis . <end>$$<start> About the same time , from the same causes , the legions of Germany rose in mutiny , with a fury proportioned to their greater numbers , in the confident hope that Germanicus Caesar would not be able to endure another's supremacy and offer himself to the legions , whose strength would carry everything before it . <end>
<start> Nec legatus obviam ibat quippe plurium vaecordia constantiam exemerat . <end>$$<start> Nor did their commander check them Indeed , the blind rage of so many had robbed him of his resolution . <end>
<start> repente lymphati destrictis gladiis in centuriones invadunt ea vetustissima militaribus odiis materies et saeviendi principium . <end>$$<start> They threw them to the earth and beat them sorely , sixty to one , so as to correspond with the number of centurions . <end>
<start> prostratos verberibus mulcant , sexageni singulos , ut numerum centurionum adaequarent tum convulsos laniatosque et partim exanimos ante vallum aut in amnem Rhenum proiciunt . <end>$$<start> Then tearing them from the ground , mangled , and some lifeless , they flung them outside the entrenchments or into the river Rhine . <end>
<start> Septimius cum perfugisset ad tribunal pedibusque Caecinae advolveretur , eo usque flagitatus est donec ad exitium dederetur . <end>$$<start> One Septimius , who fled to the tribunal and was grovelling at Caecina's feet , was persistently demanded till he was given up to destruction . <end>
<start> Cassius Chaerea , mox caede Gai Caesaris memoriam apud posteros adeptus , tum adulescens et animi ferox , inter obstantis et armatos ferro viam patefecit . <end>$$<start> Cassius Chaerea , who won for himself a memory with posterity by the murder of Caius Caesar , being then a youth of high spirit , cleared a passage with his sword through the armed and opposing throng . <end>
<start> non tribunus ultra , non castrorum praefectus ius obtinuit vigilias , stationes , et si qua alia praesens usus indixerat , ipsi partiebantur . <end>$$<start> Neither tribune nor camp-prefect maintained authority any longer Patrols , sentries , and whatever else the needs of the time required , were distributed by the men themselves . <end>
<start> Interea Germanico per Gallias , ut diximus , census accipienti excessisse Augustum adfertur . <end>$$<start> Meantime Germanicus , while , as I have related , he was collecting the taxes of Gaul , received news of the death of Augustus . <end>
<start> neptem eius Agrippinam in matrimonio pluresque ex ea liberos habebat , ipse Druso fratre Tiberii genitus , Augustae nepos , set anxius occultis in se patrui aviaeque odiis quorum causae acriores quia iniquae . <end>$$<start> He was married to the granddaughter of Augustus , Agrippina , by whom he had several children , and though he was himself the son of Drusus , brother of Tiberius , and grandson of Augusta , he was troubled by the secret hatred of his uncle and grandmother , the motives for which were the more venomous because unjust . <end>
<start> quippe Drusi magna apud populum Romanum memoria , credebaturque , si rerum potitus foret , libertatem redditurus . <end>$$<start> For the memory of Drusus was held in honour by the Roman people , and they believed that had he obtained empire , he would have restored freedom . <end>
<start> unde in Germanicum favor et spes eadem . <end>$$<start> Hence they regarded Germanicus with favour and with the same hope . <end>
<start> nam iuveni civile ingenium , mira comitas et diversa ab Tiberii sermone vultu , adrogantibus et obscuris . <end>$$<start> He was indeed a young man of unaspiring temper , and of wonderful kindliness , contrasting strongly with the proud and mysterious reserve that marked the conversation and the features of Tiberius . <end>
<start> accedebant muliebres offensiones novercalibus Liviae in Agrippinam stimulis , atque ipsa Agrippina paulo commotior , nisi quod castitate et mariti amore quamvis indomitum animum in bonum vertebat . <end>$$<start> Then , there were feminine jealousies , Livia feeling a stepmother's bitterness towards Agrippina , and Agrippina herself too being rather excitable , only her purity and love of her husband gave a right direction to her otherwise imperious disposition . <end>
<start> dehinc audito legionum tumultu raptim profectus obvias extra castra habuit , deiectis in terram oculis velut paenitentia . <end>$$<start> As soon as he entered the entrenchments , confused murmurs became audible . <end>
<start> vexilla praeferri ut id saltem discerneret cohortis tarde obtemperavere . <end>$$<start> The standards were then to be advanced , so that thus at least the cohorts might be distinguished . <end>
<start> silentio haec vel murmure modico audita sunt . <end>$$<start> He was heard in silence or with but a slight murmur . <end>
<start> Vt seditionem attigit , ubi modestia militaris , ubi veteris disciplinae decus , quonam tribunos , quo centuriones exegissent , rogitans , nudant universi corpora , cicatrices ex vulneribus , verberum notas exprobrant . <end>$$<start> As soon as he touched on the mutiny and asked what had become of soldierly obedience , of the glory of ancient discipline , whither they had driven their tribunes and centurions , they all bared their bodies and taunted him with the scars of their wounds and the marks of the lash . <end>
<start> mox indiscretis vocibus pretia vacationum , angustias stipendii , duritiam operum ac propriis nominibus incusant vallum , fossas , pabuli materiae lignorum adgestus , et si qua alia ex necessitate aut adversus otium castrorum quaeruntur . <end>$$<start> And then with confused exclamations they spoke bitterly of the prices of exemptions , of their scanty pay , of the severity of their tasks , with special mention of the entrenchment , the fosse , the conveyance of fodder , building-timber , firewood , and whatever else had to be procured from necessity , or as a check on idleness in the camp . <end>
<start> atrocissimus veteranorum clamor oriebatur , qui tricena aut supra stipendia numerantes , mederetur fessis , neu mortem in isdem laboribus , sed finem tam exercitae militiae neque inopem requiem orabant . <end>$$<start> The fiercest clamour arose from the veteran soldiers , who , as they counted their thirty campaigns or more , implored him to relieve worn-out men , and not let them die under the same hardships , but have an end of such harassing service , and repose without beggary . <end>
<start> fuere etiam qui legatam a divo Augusto pecuniam reposcerent , faustis in Germanicum ominibus . <end>$$<start> Some even claimed the legacy of the Divine Augustus , with words of good omen for Germanicus , and , should he wish for empire , they showed themselves abundantly willing . <end>
<start> et si vellet imperium promptos ostentavere tum vero , quasi scelere contaminaretur , praeceps tribunali desiluit . <end>$$<start> Thereupon , as though he were contracting the pollution of guilt , he leapt impetuously from the tribunal . <end>
<start> opposuerunt abeunti arma , minitantes , ni regrederetur . <end>$$<start> The men opposed his departure with their weapons , threatening him repeatedly if he would not go back . <end>
<start> at ille moriturum potius quam fidem exueret clamitans , ferrum a latere diripuit elatumque deferebat in pectus , ni proximi prensam dextram vi attinuissent . <end>$$<start> But Germanicus protesting that he would die rather than cast off his loyalty , plucked his sword from his side , raised it aloft and was plunging it into his breast , when those nearest him seized his hand and held it by force . <end>
<start> extrema et conglobata inter se pars contionis ac , vix credibile dictu , quidam singuli propius incedentes feriret hortabantur et miles nomine Calusidius strictum obtulit gladium , addito acutiorem esse . <end>$$<start> The remotest and most densely crowded part of the throng , and , what almost passes belief , some , who came close up to him , urged him to strike the blow , and a soldier , by name Calusidius , offered him a drawn sword , saying that it was sharper than his own . <end>
<start> saevum id malique moris etiam furentibus visum , ac spatium fuit quo Caesar ab amicis in tabernaculum raperetur . <end>$$<start> Even in their fury , this seemed to them a savage act and one of evil precedent , and there was a pause during which Caesar's friends hurried him into his tent . <end>
<start> Consultatum ibi de remedio . <end>$$<start> There they took counsel how to heal matters . <end>
<start> etenim nuntiabatur parari legatos qui superiorem exercitum ad causam eandem traherent . <end>$$<start> The alarm was heightened by the knowledge that the enemy was aware of the Roman mutiny , and would certainly attack if the Rhine bank were undefended . <end>
<start> destinatum excidio Vbiorum oppidum , imbutasque praeda manus in direptionem Galliarum erupturas . <end>$$<start> Yet if the auxiliary troops and allies were to be armed against the retiring legions , civil war was in fact begun . <end>
<start> augebat metum gnarus Romanae seditionis et , si omitteretur ripa , invasurus hostis at si auxilia et socii adversum abscedentis legiones armarentur , civile bellum suscipi . <end>$$<start> Severity would be dangerous profuse liberality would be scandalous Whether all or nothing were conceded to the soldiery , the State was equally in jeopardy . <end>
<start> periculosa severitas , flagitiosa largitio seu nihil militi sive omnia concedentur in ancipiti res publica . <end>$$<start> that there was a conditional release for those who had served sixteen , and that they were to be retained under a standard with immunity from everything except actually keeping off the enemy . <end>
<start> missio per tribunos maturatur , largitio differebatur in hiberna cuiusque . <end>$$<start> Payment was put off till they reached their respective winterquarters . <end>
<start> non abscessere quintani unetvicesimanique donec isdem in aestivis contracta ex viatico amicorum ipsiusque Caesaris pecunia persolveretur . <end>$$<start> The men of the fifth and twenty-first legions refused to go till in the summer-camp where they stood the money was made up out of the purses of Germanicus himself and his friends , and paid in full . <end>
<start> primam ac vicesimam legiones Caecina legatus in civitatem Vbiorum reduxit turpi agmine cum fisci de imperatore rapti inter signa interque aquilas veherentur . <end>$$<start> The first and twentieth legions were led back by their officer Caecina to the canton of the Ubii , marching in disgrace , since sums of money which had been extorted from the general were carried among the eagles and standards . <end>
<start> Germanicus superiorem ad exercitum profectus secundam et tertiam decumam et sextam decumam legiones nihil cunctatas sacramento adigit . <end>$$<start> Germanicus went to the Upper Army , and the second , thirteenth , and sixteenth legions , without any delay , accepted from him the oath of allegiance . <end>
<start> quartadecumani paulum dubitaverant pecunia et missio quamvis non flagitantibus oblata est . <end>$$<start> The fourteenth hesitated a little , but their money and the discharge were offered even without their demanding it . <end>
<start> At in Chaucis coeptavere seditionem praesidium agitantes vexillarii discordium legionum et praesenti duorum militum supplicio paulum repressi sunt . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile there was an outbreak among the Chauci , begun by some veterans of the mutinous legions on garrison duty . <end>
<start> deinde intumescente motu profugus repertusque , postquam intutae latebrae , praesidium ab audacia mutuatur non praefectum ab iis , sed Germanicum ducem , sed Tiberium imperatorem violari . <end>$$<start> It was not , he told them , the camp-prefect , it was Germanicus , their general , it was Tiberius , their emperor , whom they were insulting . <end>
<start> simul exterritis qui obstiterant , raptum vexillum ad ripam vertit , et si quis agmine decessisset , pro desertore fore clamitans , reduxit in hiberna turbidos et nihil ausos . <end>$$<start> At the same moment , overawing all resistance , he seized the standard , faced round towards the river-bank , and exclaiming that whoever left the ranks , he would hold as a deserter , he led them back into their winter-quarters , disaffected indeed , but cowed . <end>
<start> Interea legati ab senatu regressum iam apud aram Vbiorum Germanicum adeunt . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile envoys from the Senate had an interview with Germanicus , who had now returned , at the Altar of the Ubii . <end>
<start> duae ibi legiones , prima atque vicesima , veteranique nuper missi sub vexillo hiemabant . <end>$$<start> Two legions , the first and twentieth , with veterans discharged and serving under a standard , were there in winter-quarters . <end>
<start> pavidos et conscientia vaecordes intrat metus venisse patrum iussu qui inrita facerent quae per seditionem expresserant . <end>$$<start> In the bewilderment of terror and conscious guilt they were penetrated by an apprehension that persons had come at the Senate's orders to cancel the concessions they had extorted by mutiny . <end>
<start> utque mos vulgo quamvis falsis reum subdere , Munatium Plancum consulatu functum , principem legationis , auctorem senatus consulti incusant . <end>$$<start> And as it is the way with a mob to fix any charge , however groundless , on some particular person , they reproached Manatius Plancus , an ex-consul and the chief envoy , with being the author of the Senate's decree . <end>
<start> et nocte concubia vexillum in domo Germanici situm flagitare occipiunt , concursuque ad ianuam facto moliuntur foris , extractum cubili Caesarem tradere vexillum intento mortis metu subigunt . <end>$$<start> At midnight they began to demand the imperial standard kept in Germanicus's quarters , and having rushed together to the entrance , burst the door , dragged Caesar from his bed , and forced him by menaces of death to give up the standard . <end>
<start> mox vagi per vias obvios habuere legatos , audita consternatione ad Germanicum tendentis . <end>$$<start> Then roaming through the camp-streets , they met the envoys , who on hearing of the tumult were hastening to Germanicus . <end>
<start> ingerunt contumelias , caedem parant , Planco maxime , quem dignitas fuga impediverat . <end>$$<start> They loaded them with insults , and were on the point of murdering them , Plancus especially , whose high rank had deterred him from flight . <end>
<start> neque aliud periclitanti subsidium quam castra primae legionis . <end>$$<start> In his peril he found safety only in the camp of the first legion . <end>
<start> illic signa et aquilam amplexus religione sese tutabatur , ac ni aquilifer Calpurnius vim extremam arcuisset , rarum etiam inter hostis , legatus populi Romani Romanis in castris sanguine suo altaria deum commaculavisset . <end>$$<start> There clasping the standards and the eagle , he sought to protect himself under their sanctity And had not the eagle-bearer , Calpurnius , saved him from the worst violence , the blood of an envoy of the Roman people , an occurrence rare even among our foes , would in a Roman camp have stained the altars of the gods . <end>
<start> luce demum , postquam dux et miles et facta noscebantur , ingressus castra Germanicus perduci ad se Plancum imperat recepitque in tribunal . <end>$$<start> At last , with the light of day , when the general and the soldiers and the whole affair were clearly recognised , Germanicus entered the camp , ordered Plancus to be conducted to him , and received him on the tribunal . <end>
<start> tum fatalem increpans rabiem , neque militum sed deum ira resurgere , cur venerint legati aperit . <end>$$<start> He then upbraided them with their fatal infatuation , revived not so much by the anger of the soldiers as by that of heaven , and explained the reasons of the envoys' arrival . <end>
<start> ius legationis atque ipsius Planci gravem et immeritum casum , simul quantum dedecoris adierit legio , facunde miseratur , attonitaque magis quam quieta contione legatos praesidio auxiliarium equitum dimittit . <end>$$<start> On the rights of ambassadors , on the dreadful and undeserved peril of Plancus , and also on the disgrace into which the legion had brought itself , he dwelt with the eloquence of pity , and while the throng was confounded rather than appeased , he dismissed the envoys with an escort of auxiliary cavalry . <end>
<start> Eo in metu arguere Germanicum omnes quod non ad superiorem exercitum pergeret , ubi obsequia et contra rebellis auxilium satis superque missione et pecunia et mollibus consultis peccatum vel si vilis ipsi salus , cur filium parvulum , cur gravidam coniugem inter furentis et omnis humani iuris violatores haberet . <end>$$<start> Amid the alarm all condemned Germanicus for not going to the Upper Army , where he might find obedience and help against the rebels Enough and more than enough blunders , they said , had been made by granting discharges and money , indeed , by conciliatory measures . <end>
<start> diu cunctatus aspernantem uxorem , cum se divo Augusto ortam neque degenerem ad pericula testaretur , postremo uterum eius et communem filium multo cum fletu complexus , ut abiret perpulit . <end>$$<start> Slowly moved along a pitiable procession of women , a general's fugitive wife with a little son in her bosom , her friends' wives weeping round her , as with her they were dragging themselves from the camp . <end>
<start> Non florentis Caesaris neque suis in castris , sed velut in urbe victa facies gemitusque ac planctus etiam militum auris oraque advertere progrediuntur contuberniis . <end>$$<start> There was no appearance of the triumphant general about Germanicus , and he seemed to be in a conquered city rather than in his own camp , while groans and wailings attracted the ears and looks even of the soldiers . <end>
<start> feminas inlustris , non centurionem ad tutelam , non militem , nihil imperatoriae uxoris aut comitatus soliti pergere ad Treviros et externae fidei . <end>$$<start> Then they felt shame and pity , and remembered his father Agrippa , her grandfather Augustus , her father-in-law Drusus , her own glory as a mother of children , her noble purity . <end>
<start> pudor inde et miseratio et patris Agrippae , Augusti avi memoria , socer Drusus , ipsa insigni fecunditate , praeclara pudicitia . <end>$$<start> And there was her little child too , born in the camp , brought up amid the tents of the legions , whom they used to call in soldiers' fashion , Caligula , because he often wore the shoe so called , to win the men's goodwill . <end>
<start> sed nihil aeque flexit quam invidia in Treviros orant obsistunt , rediret maneret , pars Agrippinae occursantes , plurimi ad Germanicum regressi . <end>$$<start> They entreated , stopped the way , that Agrippina might return and remain , some running to meet her , while most of them went back to Germanicus . <end>
<start> isque ut erat recens dolore et ira apud circumfusos ita coepit . <end>$$<start> He , with a grief and anger that were yet fresh , thus began to address the throng around him - . <end>
<start> Non mihi uxor aut filius patre et re publica cariores sunt , sed illum quidem sua maiestas , imperium Romanum ceteri exercitus defendent . <end>$$<start> Neither wife nor son are dearer to me than my father and the State But he will surely have the protection of his own majesty , the empire of Rome that of our other armies . <end>
<start> coniugem et liberos meos , quos pro gloria vestra libens ad exitium offerrem , nunc procul a furentibus summoveo , ut quidquid istud sceleris imminet , meo tantum sanguine pietur , neve occisus Augusti pronepos , interfecta Tiberii nurus nocentiores vos faciant . <end>$$<start> My wife and children whom , were it a question of your glory , I would willingly expose to destruction , I now remove to a distance from your fury , so that whatever wickedness is thereby threatened , may be expiated by my blood only , and that you may not be made more guilty by the slaughter of a great-grandson of Augustus , and the murder of a daughter-in-law of Tiberius . <end>
<start> quid enim per hos dies inausum intemeratumve vobis . <end>$$<start> For what have you not dared , what have you not profaned during these days . <end>
<start> quod nomen huic coetui dabo . <end>$$<start> What name shall I give to this gathering . <end>
<start> hostium quoque ius et sacra legationis et fas gentium rupistis . <end>$$<start> ' The Divine Augustus cowed the legions who had fought at Actium with one look of his face . <end>
<start> divus Iulius seditionem exercitus verbo uno compescuit , Quirites vocando qui sacramentum eius detrectabant divus Augustus vultu et aspectu Actiacas legiones exterruit nos ut nondum eosdem , ita ex illis ortos si Hispaniae Syriaeve miles aspernaretur , tamen mirum et indignum erat . <end>$$<start> Though I am not yet what they were , still , descended as I am from them , it would be a strange and unworthy thing should I be spurned by the soldiery of Spain or Syria . <end>
<start> primane et vicesima legiones , illa signis a Tiberio acceptis , tu tot proeliorum socia , tot praemiis aucta , egregiam duci vestro gratiam refertis . <end>$$<start> First and twentieth legions , you who received your standards from Tiberius , you , men of the twentieth who have shared with me so many battles and have been enriched with so many rewards , is not this a fine gratitude with which you are repaying your general . <end>
<start> ipsius tirones , ipsius veteranos non missione , non pecunia satiatos hic tantum interfici centuriones , eici tribunos , includi legatos , infecta sanguine castra , flumina , meque precariam animam inter infensos trahere . <end>$$<start> that here only centurions are murdered , tribunes driven away , envoys imprisoned , camps and rivers stained with blood , while I am myself dragging on a precarious existence amid those who hate me . <end>
<start> Cur enim primo contionis die ferrum illud , quod pectori meo infigere parabam , detraxistis , o inprovidi amici . <end>$$<start> Why , on the first day of our meeting , why did you , my friends , wrest from me , in your blindness , the steel which I was preparing to plunge into my breast . <end>
<start> melius et amantius ille qui gladium offerebat . <end>$$<start> Better and more loving was the act of the man who offered me the sword . <end>
<start> legissetis ducem , qui meam quidem mortem inpunitam sineret , Vari tamen et trium legionum ulcisceretur . <end>$$<start> Never indeed may heaven suffer the Belgae , though they proffer their aid , to have the glory and honour of having rescued the name of Rome and quelled the tribes of Germany . <end>
<start> tua , dive Auguste , caelo recepta mens , tua , pater Druse , imago , tui memoria isdem istis cum militibus , quos iam pudor et gloria intrat , eluant hanc maculam irasque civilis in exitium hostibus vertant . <end>$$<start> You too , in whose faces and in whose hearts I perceive a change , if only you restore to the Senate their envoys , to the emperor his due allegiance , to myself my wife and son , do you stand aloof from pollution and separate the mutinous from among you . <end>
<start> Supplices ad haec et vera exprobrari fatentes orabant puniret noxios , ignosceret lapsis et duceret in hostem revocaretur coniunx , rediret legionum alumnus neve obses Gallis traderetur . <end>$$<start> Thereupon , as suppliants confessing that his reproaches were true , they implored him to punish the guilty , pardon those who had erred , and lead them against the enemy . <end>
<start> reditum Agrippinae excusavit ob inminentem partum et hiemem venturum filium cetera ipsi exsequerentur . <end>$$<start> And he was to recall his wife , to let the nursling of the legions return and not be handed over as a hostage to the Gauls . <end>
<start> discurrunt mutati et seditiosissimum quemque vinctos trahunt ad legatum legionis primae Gaius Caetronium , qui iudicium et poenas de singulis in hunc modum exercuit . <end>$$<start> As to Agrippina's return , he made the excuse of her approaching confinement and of winter . <end>
<start> stabant pro contione legiones destrictis gladiis reus in suggestu per tribunum ostendebatur si nocentem adclamaverant , praeceps datus trucidabatur . <end>$$<start> His son , he said , would come , and the rest they might settle themselves . <end>
<start> citatus ab imperatore nomen , ordinem , patriam , numerum stipendiorum , quae strenue in proeliis fecisset , et cui erant , dona militaria edebat . <end>$$<start> If the tribunes and the legion commended his energy and good behaviour , he retained his rank . <end>
<start> si tribuni , si legio industriam innocentiamque ad probaverant , retinebat ordinem ubi avaritiam aut crudelitatem consensu obiectavissent , solvebatur militia . <end>$$<start> where they unanimously charged him with rapacity or cruelty , he was dismissed the service . <end>
<start> Sic compositis praesentibus haud minor moles supererat ob ferociam quintae et unetvicesimae legionum , sexagesimum apud lapidem (loco Vetera nomen est) hibernantium . <end>$$<start> Quiet being thus restored for the present , a no less formidable difficulty remained through the turbulence of the fifth and twenty-first legions , who were in winter quarters sixty miles away at Old Camp , as the place was called . <end>
<start> nam primi seditionem coeptaverant atrocisslmum quodque facinus horum manibus patratum . <end>$$<start> These , in fact , had been the first to begin the mutiny , and the most atrocious deeds had been committed by their hands . <end>
<start> nec poena commilitonum exterriti nec paenitentia conversi iras retinebant . <end>$$<start> Unawed by the punishment of their comrades , and unmoved by their contrition , they still retained their resentment . <end>
<start> igitur Caesar arma classem socios demittere Rheno parat , si imperium detrectetur , bello certaturus . <end>$$<start> Caesar accordingly proposed to send an armed fleet with some of our allies down the Rhine , resolved to make war on them should they reject his authority . <end>
<start> At Romae nondum cognito qui fuisset exitus in Illyrico , et legionum Germanicarum motu audito , trepida civitas incusare Tiberium quod , dum patres et plebem , invalida et inermia , cunctatione ficta ludificetur , dissideat interim miles neque duorum adulescentium nondum adulta auctoritate comprimi queat . <end>$$<start> At Rome , meanwhile , when the result of affairs in Illyrium was not yet known , and men had heard of the commotion among the German legions , the citizens in alarm reproached Tiberius for the hypocritical irresolution with which he was befooling the senate and the people , feeble and disarmed as they were , while the soldiery were all the time in revolt , and could not be quelled by the yet imperfectly-matured authority of two striplings . <end>
<start> ire ipsum et opponere maiestatem imperatoriam debuisse cessuris ubi principem longa experientia eundemque severitatis et munificentiae summum vidissent . <end>$$<start> Could Augustus , with the feebleness of age on him , so often visit Germany , and is Tiberius , in the vigour of life , to sit in the Senate and criticise its members' words . <end>
<start> Immotum adversus eos sermones fixumque Tiberio fuit non omittere caput rerum neque se remque publicam in casum dare . <end>$$<start> Notwithstanding these remonstrances , it was the inflexible purpose of Tiberius not to quit the head-quarters of empire or to imperil himself and the State . <end>
<start> multa quippe et diversa angebant validior per Germaniam exercitus , propior apud Pannoniam . <end>$$<start> The army in Germany was the stronger that in Pannonia the nearer . <end>
<start> ille Galliarum opibus subnixus , hic Italiae inminens quos igitur anteferret . <end>$$<start> the first was supported by all the strength of Gaul . <end>
<start> simul adulescentibus excusatum quaedam ad patrem reicere , resistentisque Germanico aut Druso posse a se mitigari vel infringi quod aliud subsidium si imperatorem sprevissent . <end>$$<start> However , as if on the eve of departure , he selected his attendants , provided his camp-equipage , and prepared a fleet . <end>
<start> ceterum ut iam iamque iturus legit comites , conquisivit impedimenta , adornavit navis mox hiemem aut negotia varie causatus primo prudentis , dein vulgum , diutissime provincias fefellit . <end>$$<start> then winter and matters of business were the various pretexts with which he amused , first , sensible men , then the populace , last , and longest of all , the provinces . <end>
<start> At Germanicus , quamquam contracto exercitu et parata in defectores ultione , dandum adhuc spatium ratus , si recenti exemplo sibi ipsi consulerent , praemittit litteras ad Caecinam , venire se valida manu ac , ni supplicium in malos praesumant , usurum promisca caede . <end>$$<start> Germanicus meantime , though he had concentrated his army and prepared vengeance against the mutineers , thought that he ought still to allow them an interval , in case they might , with the late warning before them , regard their safety . <end>
<start> eas Caecina aquiliferis signiferisque et quod maxime castrorum sincerum erat occulte recitat , utque cunctos infamiae , se ipsos morti eximant hortatur nam in pace causas et merita spectari , ubi bellum ingruat innocentis ac noxios iuxta cadere . <end>$$<start> Caecina read the letter confidentially to the eagle and standardbearers , and to all in the camp who were least tainted by disloyalty , and urged them to save the whole army from disgrace , and themselves from destruction . <end>
<start> illi temptatis quos idoneos rebantur , postquam maiorem legionum partem in officio vident , de sententia legati statuunt tempus , quo foedissimum quemque et seditioni promptum ferro invadant . <end>$$<start> In peace , he said , the merits of a man's case are carefully weighed Upon this , they sounded those whom they thought best for their purpose , and when they saw that a majority of their legions remained loyal , at the commander's suggestion they fixed a time for falling with the sword on all the vilest and foremost of the mutineers . <end>
<start> tunc signo inter se dato inrumpunt contubernia , trucidant ignaros , nullo nisi consciis noscente quod caedis initium , quis finis . <end>$$<start> Then , at a mutually given signal , they rushed into the tents , and butchered the unsuspecting men , none but those in the secret knowing what was the beginning or what was to be the end of the slaughter . <end>
<start> Diversa omnium , quae umquam accidere , civilium armorum facies . <end>$$<start> The scene was a contrast to all civil wars which have ever occurred . <end>
<start> non proelio , non adversis e castris , sed isdem e cubilibus , quos simul vescentis dies , simul quietos nox habuerat , discedunt in partis , ingerunt tela clamor vulnera sanguis palam , causa in occulto . <end>$$<start> It was not in battle , it was not from opposing camps , it was from those same dwellings where day saw them at their common meals , night resting from labour , that they divided themselves into two factions , and showered on each other their missiles . <end>
<start> et quidam bonorum caesi , postquam intellecto in quos saeviretur pessimi quoque arma rapuerant . <end>$$<start> Even some loyal men were slain , for , on its being once understood who were the objects of fury , some of the worst mutineers too had seized on weapons . <end>
<start> neque legatus aut tribunus moderator adfuit permissa vulgo licentia atque ultio et satietas . <end>$$<start> Neither commander nor tribune was present to control them . <end>
<start> mox ingressus castra Germanicus , non medicinam illud plurimis cum lacrimis sed cladem appellans , cremari corpora iubet . <end>$$<start> the men were allowed license and vengeance to their heart's content . <end>
<start> sequitur ardorem militum Caesar iunctoque ponte tramittit duodecim milia e legionibus , sex et viginti socias cohortis , octo equitum alas , quarum ea seditione intemerata modestia fuit . <end>$$<start> Caesar followed up the enthusiasm of the men , and having bridged over the Rhine , he sent across it 12 , 000 from the legions , with six-and-twenty allied cohorts , and eight squadrons of cavalry , whose discipline had been without a stain during the mutiny . <end>
<start> Laeti neque procul Germani agitabant , dum iustitio ob amissum Augustum , post discordiis attinemur . <end>$$<start> There was exultation among the Germans , not far off , as long as we were detained by the public mourning for the loss of Augustus , and then by our dissensions . <end>
<start> at Romanus agmine propero silvam Caesiam limitemque a Tiberio coeptum scindit , castra in limite locat , frontem ac tergum vallo , latera concaedibus munitus . <end>$$<start> He then penetrated some forest passes but little known , and , as there were two routes , he deliberated whether he should pursue the short and ordinary route , or that which was more difficult unexplored , and consequently unguarded by the enemy . <end>
<start> inde saltus obscuros permeat consultatque ex duobus itineribus breve et solitum sequatur an inpeditius et intemptatum eoque hostibus in cautum . <end>$$<start> He chose the longer way , and hurried on every remaining preparation , for his scouts had brought word that among the Germans it was a night of festivity , with games , and one of their grand banquets . <end>
<start> delecta longiore via cetera adcelerantur etenim attulerant exploratores festam eam Germanis noctem ac sollemnibus epulis ludicram . <end>$$<start> Caecina had orders to advance with some light cohorts , and to clear away any obstructions from the woods . <end>
<start> Caesar avidas legiones quo latior populatio foret quattuor in cuneos dispertit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , to spread devastation widely , divided his eager legions into four columns , and ravaged a space of fifty miles with fire and sword . <end>
<start> non sexus , non aetas miserationem attulit profana simul et sacra et celeberrimum illis gentibus templum quod Tanfanae vocabant solo aequantur . <end>$$<start> The general knew this , and he marched , prepared both to advance and to fight . <end>
<start> excivit ea caedes Bructeros , Tubantes , Vsipetes , saltusque , per quos exercitui regressus , insedere . <end>$$<start> The twentieth legion secured the rear , and , next , were the rest of the allies . <end>
<start> pars equitum et auxiliariae cohortes ducebant , mox prima legio , et mediis impedimentis sinistrum latus unetvicesimani , dextrum quintani clausere , vicesima legio terga firmavit , post ceteri sociorum . <end>$$<start> The light cohorts were thrown into confusion by the dense masses of the Germans , when Caesar rode up to the men of the twentieth legion , and in a loud voice exclaimed that this was the time for wiping out the mutiny . <end>
<start> exarsere animis unoque impetu perruptum hostem redigunt in aperta caeduntque simul primi agminis copiae evasere silvas castraque communivere . <end>$$<start> At the same moment the troops of the van emerged from the woods and intrenched a camp . <end>
<start> quietum inde iter , fidensque recentibus ac priorum oblitus miles in hibernis locatur . <end>$$<start> After this their march was uninterrupted , and the soldiery , with the confidence of recent success , and forgetful of the past , were placed in winter-quarters . <end>
<start> Nuntiata ea Tiberium laetitia curaque adfecere gaudebat oppressam seditionem , sed quod largiendis pecuniis et missione festinata favorem militum quaesivisset , bellica quoque Germanici gloria angebatur . <end>$$<start> The news was a source of joy and also of anxiety to Tiberius He rejoiced that the mutiny was crushed , but the fact that Germanicus had won the soldiers' favour by lavishing money , and promptly granting the discharge , as well as his fame as a soldier , annoyed him . <end>
<start> rettulit tamen ad senatum de rebus gestis multaque de virtute eius memoravit , magis in speciem verbis adornata quam ut penitus sentire crederetur . <end>$$<start> Still , he brought his achievements under the notice of the Senate , and spoke much of his greatness in language elaborated for effect , more so than could be believed to come from his inmost heart . <end>
<start> paucioribus Drusum et finem Illyrici motus laudavit , sed intentior et fida oratione . <end>$$<start> He bestowed a briefer praise on Drusus , and on the termination of the disturbance in Illyricum , but he was more earnest , and his speech more hearty . <end>
<start> cunctaque quae Germanicus indulserat servavit etiam apud Pannonicos exercitus . <end>$$<start> And he confirmed , too , in the armies of Pannonia all the concessions of Germanicus . <end>
<start> Eodem anno Iulia supremum diem obiit , ob impudicitiam olim a patre Augusto Pandateria insula , mox oppido Reginorum , qui Siculum fretum accolunt , clausa . <end>$$<start> That same year Julia ended her days For her profligacy she had formerly been confined by her father Augustus in the island of Pandateria , and then in the town of the Regini on the shores of the straits of Sicily . <end>
<start> fuerat in matrimonio Tiberii florentibus Gaio et Lucio Caesaribus spreveratque ut inparem . <end>$$<start> She had been the wife of Tiberius while Caius and Lucius Caesar were in their glory , and had disdained him as an unequal match . <end>

<start> imperium adeptus extorrem , infamem et post interfectum Postumum Agrippam omnis spei egenam inopia ac tabe longa peremit , obscuram fore necem longinquitate exilii ratus . <end>$$<start> When he obtained the empire , he left her in banishment and disgrace , deprived of all hope after the murder of Postumus Agrippa , and let her perish by a lingering death of destitution , with the idea that an obscurity would hang over her end from the length of her exile . <end>
<start> par causa saevitiae in Sempronium Gracchum , qui familia nobili , sollers ingenio et prave facundus , eandem Iuliam in matrimonio Marci Agrippae temeraverat . <end>$$<start> He had a like motive for cruel vengeance on Sempronius Gracchus , a man of noble family , of shrewd understanding , and a perverse eloquence , who had seduced this same Julia when she was the wife of Marcus Agrippa . <end>
<start> litteraeque quas Iulia patri Augusto cum insectatione Tiberii scripsit a Graccho compositae credebantur . <end>$$<start> When she had been handed over to Tiberius , her persistent paramour inflamed her with disobedience and hatred towards her husband . <end>
<start> igitur amotus Cercinam , Africi maris insulam , quattuordecim annis exilium toleravit . <end>$$<start> and a letter which Julia wrote to her father , Augustus , inveighing against Tiberius , was supposed to be the composition of Gracchus . <end>
<start> tunc milites ad caedem missi invenere in prominenti litoris nihil laetum opperientem . <end>$$<start> He was accordingly banished to Cercina , where he endured an exile of fourteen years . <end>
<start> quorum adventu breve tempus petivit ut suprema mandata uxori Alliariae per litteras daret , cervicemque percussoribus obtulit . <end>$$<start> Then the soldiers who were sent to slay him , found him on a promontory , expecting no good . <end>
<start> quidam non Roma eos milites , sed ab Lucius Asprenate pro consule Africae missos tradidere auctore Tiberio , qui famam caedis posse in Asprenatem verti frustra speraverat . <end>$$<start> Some have related that these soldiers were not sent from Rome , but by Lucius Asprenas , proconsul of Africa , on the authority of Tiberius , who had vainly hoped that the infamy of the murder might be shifted on Asprenas . <end>
<start> Idem annus novas caerimonias accepit addito sodalium Augustalium sacerdotio , ut quondam Titus Tatius retinendis Sabinorum sacris sodalis Titios instituerat . <end>$$<start> The same year witnessed the establishment of religious ceremonies in a new priesthood of the brotherhood of the Augustales , just as in former days Titus Tatius , to retain the rites of the Sabines , had instituted the Titian brotherhood . <end>
<start> sorte ducti e primoribus civitatis unus et viginti Tiberius Drusus que et Claudius et Germanicus adiciuntur . <end>$$<start> Twenty-one were chosen by lot from the chief men of the State . <end>
<start> ludos Augustalis tunc primum coeptos turbavit discordia ex certamine histrionum . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , Drusus , Claudius , and Germanicus , were added to the number . <end>
<start> indulserat ei ludicro Auaustus , dum Maecenati obtemperat effuso in amorem Bathylli . <end>$$<start> The Augustal game's which were then inaugurated , were disturbed by quarrels arising out of rivalry between the actors . <end>
<start> alia Tiberio morum via sed populum per tot annos molliter habitum nondum audebat ad duriora vertere . <end>$$<start> But a people so many years indulgently treated , he did not yet venture to put under harsher control . <end>
<start> Druso Caesare Gaius Norbano consulibus decernitur Germanico triumphus manente bello . <end>$$<start> In the consulship of Drusus Caesar and Caius Norbanus , Germanicus had a triumph decreed him , though war still lasted . <end>
<start> quod quamquam in aestatem summa ope parabat , initio veris et repentino in Chattos excursu praecepit . <end>$$<start> And though it was for the summer campaign that he was most vigorously preparing , he anticipated it by a sudden inroad on the Chatti in the beginning of spring . <end>
<start> nam spes incesserat dissidere hostem in Arminium ac Segestem , insignem utrumque perfidia in nos aut fide . <end>$$<start> There had , in fact , sprung up a hope of the enemy being divided between Arminius and Segestes , famous , respectively , for treachery and loyalty towards us . <end>
<start> Segestes quamquam consensu gentis in bellum tractus discors manebat , auctis privatim odiis , quod Arminius filiam eius alii pactam rapuerat gener invisus inimici soceri . <end>$$<start> But Varus fell by fate and by the sword of Arminius , with whom Segestes , though dragged into war by the unanimous voice of the nation , continued to be at feud , his resentment being heightened by personal motives , as Arminius had married his daughter who was betrothed to another . <end>
<start> quaeque apud concordes vincula caritatis , incitamenta irarum apud inrensos erant . <end>$$<start> With a son-in-law detested , and fathers-in-law also at enmity , what are bonds of love between united hearts became with bitter foes incentives to fury . <end>
<start> Igitur Germanicus quattuor legiones , quinque auxiliarium milia et tumultuarias catervas Germanorum cis Rhenum colentium Caecinae tradit . <end>$$<start> Germanicus accordingly gave Caecina four legions , five thousand auxiliaries , with some hastily raised levies from the Germans dwelling on the left bank of the Rhine . <end>
<start> totidem legiones , duplicem sociorum numerum ipse ducit , positoque castello super vestigia paterni praesidii in monte Tauno expeditum exercitum in Chattos rapit , Lucius Apronio ad munitiones viarum et fluminum relicto . <end>$$<start> He was himself at the head of an equal number of legions and twice as many allies Having established a fort on the site of his father's entrenchments on Mount Taunus he hurried his troops in quick marching order against the Chatti , leaving Lucius Apronius to direct works connected with roads and bridges . <end>
<start> nam (rarum illi caelo) siccitate et amnibus modicis inoffensum iter properaverat , imbresque et fluminum auctus regredienti metuebantur . <end>$$<start> With a dry season and comparatively shallow streams , a rare circumstance in that climate , he had accomplished , without obstruction , rapid march , and he feared for his return heavy rains and swollen rivers . <end>
<start> sed Chattis adeo inprovisus advenit , ut quod imbecillum aetate ac sexu statim captum aut trucidatum sit . <end>$$<start> But so suddenly did he come on the Chatti that all the helpless from age or sex were at once captured or slaughtered . <end>
<start> iuventus flumen Adranam nando tramiserat , Romanosque pontem coeptantis arcebant . <end>$$<start> Their able-bodied men had swum across the river Adrana , and were trying to keep back the Romans as they were commencing a bridge . <end>
<start> dein tormentis sagittisque pulsi , temptatis frustra condicionibus pacis , cum quidam ad Germanicum perfugissent , reliqui omissis pagis vicisque in silvas disperguntur . <end>$$<start> Subsequently they were driven back by missiles and arrows , and having in vain attempted for peace , some took refuge with Germanicus , while the rest leaving their cantons and villages dispersed themselves in their forests . <end>
<start> Caesar incenso Mattio (id genti caput) aperta populatus vertit ad Rhenum , non auso hoste terga abeuntium lacessere , quod illi moris , quotiens astu magis quam per formidinem cessit . <end>$$<start> After burning Mattium , the capital of the tribe , and ravaging the open country , Germanicus marched back towards the Rhine , the enemy not daring to harass the rear of the retiring army , which was his usual practice whenever he fell back by way of stratagem rather than from panic . <end>
<start> fuerat animus Cheruscis iuvare Chattos , sed exterruit Caecina huc illuc ferens arma . <end>$$<start> It had been the intention of the Cherusci to help the Chatti . <end>
<start> Neque multo post legati a Segeste venerunt auxilium orantes adversus vim popularium a quis circumsedebatur , validiore apud eos Arminio quoniam bellum suadebat nam barbaris , quanto quis audacia promptus , tanto magis fidus rebusque motis potior habetur . <end>$$<start> Not long after envoys came from Segestes , imploring aid against the violence of his fellow-countrymen , by whom he was hemmed in , and with whom Arminius had greater influence , because he counselled war . <end>
<start> addiderat Segestes legatis filium , nomine Segimundum sed iuvenis conscientia cunctabatur . <end>$$<start> With the envoys Segestes had associated his son , by name Segimundus , but the youth hung back from a consciousness of guilt . <end>
<start> quippe anno quo Germaniae descivere sacerdos apud aram Vbiorum creatus ruperat vittas , profugus ad rebellis . <end>$$<start> For in the year of the revolt of Germany he had been appointed a priest at the altar of the Ubii , and had rent the sacred garlands , and fled to the rebels . <end>
<start> adductus tamen in spem clementiae Romanae pertulit patris mandata benigneque exceptus cum praesidio Gallicam in ripam missus est . <end>$$<start> Induced , however , to hope for mercy from Rome , he brought his father's message . <end>
<start> Germanico pretium fuit convertere agmen , pugnatumque in obsidentis , et ereptus Segestes magna cum propinquorum et clientium manu . <end>$$<start> he was graciously received and sent with an escort to the Gallic bank of the Rhine . <end>
<start> inerant feminae nobiles , inter quas uxor Arminii eademque filia Segestis , mariti magis quam parentis animo , neque victa in lacrimas neque voce supplex . <end>$$<start> It was now worth while for Germanicus to march back his army A battle was fought against the besiegers and Segestes was rescued with a numerous band of kinsfolk and dependents . <end>
<start> ferebantur et spolia Varianae cladis , plerisque eorum qui tum in deditionem veniebant praedae data simul Segestes ipse , ingens visu et memoria bonae societatis inpavidus . <end>$$<start> The spoils also taken in the defeat of Varus were brought in , having been given as plunder to many of those who were then being surrendered . <end>
<start> Verba eius in hunc modum fuere non hic mihi primus erga populum Romanum fidei et constantiae dies . <end>$$<start> Segestes too was there in person , a stately figure , fearless in the remembrance of having been a faithful ally . <end>
<start> ex quo a divo Augusto civitate donatus sum , amicos inimicosque ex vestris utilitatibus delegi , neque odio patriae (quippe proditores etiam iis quos anteponunt invisi sunt) , verum quia Romanis Germanisque idem conducere et pacem quam bellum probabam . <end>$$<start> His speech was to this effect This is not my first day of steadfast loyalty towards the Roman people From the time that the Divine Augustus gave me the citizenship , I have chosen my friends and foes with an eye to your advantage , not from hatred of my fatherland (for traitors are detested even by those whom they prefer) but because I held that Romans and Germans have the same interests , and that peace is better than war . <end>
<start> ergo raptorem filiae meae , violatorem foederis vestri , Arminium apud Varum , qui tum exercitui praesidebat , reum feci . <end>$$<start> And therefore I denounced to Varus , who then commanded your army , Arminius , the ravisher of my daughter , the violater of your treaty . <end>
<start> dilatus segnitia ducis , quia parum praesidii in legibus erat , ut me et Arminium et conscios vinciret flagitavi testis illa nox , mihi utinam potius novissima! quae secuta sunt defleri magis quam defendi possunt ceterum et inieci catenas Arminio et a factione eius iniectas perpessus sum . <end>$$<start> I was put off by that dilatory general , and , as I found but little protection in the laws , I urged him to arrest myself , Arminius , and his accomplices . <end>
<start> atque ubi primum tui copia , vetera novis et quieta turbidis antehabeo , neque ob praemium , sed ut me perfidia exsolvam , simul genti Germanorum idoneus conciliator , si paenitentiam quam perniciem maluerit . <end>$$<start> That night is my witness would that it had been my last What followed , may be deplored rather than defended . <end>
<start> pro iuventa et errore filii veniam precor filiam necessitate huc adductam fateor . <end>$$<start> However , I threw Arminius into chains and I endured to have them put on myself by his partisans . <end>
<start> Caesar clementi responso liberis propinquisque eius incolumitatem , ipsi sedem vetere in provincia pollicetur . <end>$$<start> He then led back the army and received on the proposal of Tiberius the title of Imperator . <end>
<start> exercitum reduxit nomenque imperatoris auctore Tiberio accepit . <end>$$<start> The wife of Arminius gave birth to a male child . <end>
<start> Arminii uxor virilis sexus stirpem edidit educatus Ravennae puer quo mox ludibrio conflictatus sit in tempore memorabo . <end>$$<start> the boy , who was brought up at Ravenna , soon afterwards suffered an insult , which at the proper time I shall relate . <end>
<start> Fama dediti benigneque excepti Segestis vulgata , ut quibusque bellum invitis aut cupientibus erat , spe vel dolore accipitur . <end>$$<start> The report of the surrender and kind reception of Segestes , when generally known , was heard with hope or grief according as men shrank from war or desired it . <end>
<start> Arminium super insitam violentiam rapta uxor , subiectus servitio uxoris uterus vaecordem agebant , volitabatque per Cheruscos , arma in Segestem , arma in Caesarem poscens . <end>$$<start> He flew hither and thither among the Cherusci , demanding war against Segestes , war against Caesar . <end>
<start> neque probris temperabat egregium patrem , magnum imperatorem , fortem exercitum , quorum tot manus unam mulierculam avexerint . <end>$$<start> And he refrained not from taunts Noble the father , he would say , mighty the general , brave the army which , with such strength , has carried off one weak woman . <end>
<start> sibi tres legiones , totidem legatos procubuisse . <end>$$<start> Before me , three legions , three commanders have fallen . <end>
<start> non enim se proditione neque adversus feminas gravidas , sed palam adversus armatos bellum tractare . <end>$$<start> Not by treachery , not against pregnant women , but openly against armed men do I wage war . <end>
<start> cerni adhuc Germanorum in lucis signa Romana , quae dis patriis suspenderit . <end>$$<start> There are still to be seen in the groves of Germany the Roman standards which I hung up to our country's gods Let Segestes dwell on the conquered bank . <end>
<start> coleret Segestes victam ripam , redderet filio sacerdotium hominum Germanos numquam satis excusaturos quod inter Albim et Rhenum virgas et securis et togam viderint . <end>$$<start> let him restore to his son his priestly office one thing there is which Germans will never thoroughly excuse , their having seen between the Elbe and the Rhine the Roman rods , axes , and toga . <end>
<start> si patriam parentes antiqua mallent quam domi nos et colonias novas , Arminium potius gloriae ac libertatis quam Segestem flagitiosae servitutis ducem sequerentur . <end>$$<start> If you prefer your fatherland , your ancestors , your ancient life to tyrants and to new colonies , follow as your leader Arminius to glory and to freedom rather than Segestes to ignominious servitude . <end>
<start> Conciti per haec non modo Cherusci , sed conterminae gentes , tractusque in partis Inguiomerus Arminii patruus , vetere apud Romanos auctoritate . <end>$$<start> This language roused not only the Cherusci but the neighbouring tribes and drew to their side Inguiomerus , the uncle of Arminius , who had long been respected by the Romans . <end>
<start> unde maior Caesari metus . <end>$$<start> This increased Caesar's alarm . <end>
<start> et ne bellum mole una ingrueret Caecinam cum quadraginta cohortibus Romanis distrahendo hosti per Bructeros ad flumen Amisiam mittit , equitem Pedo praefectus finibus Frisiorum ducit . <end>$$<start> That the war might not burst in all its fury on one point , he sent Caecina through the Bructeri to the river Amisia with forty Roman cohorts to distract the enemy , while the cavalry was led by its commander Pedo by the territories of the Frisii . <end>
<start> ipse inpositas navibus quattuor legiones per lacus vexit simulque pedes eques classis apud praedictum amnem convenere . <end>$$<start> Germanicus himself put four legions on shipboard and conveyed them through the lakes , and the infantry , cavalry , and fleet met simultaneously at the river already mentioned . <end>
<start> Chauci cum auxilia pollicerentur , in commilitium adsciti sunt . <end>$$<start> The Chauci , on promising aid , were associated with us in military fellowship . <end>
<start> Bructeros sua urentis expedita cum manu L Stertinius missu Germanici fudit interque caedem et praedam repperit unde vicesimae legionis aquilam cum Varo amissam . <end>$$<start> Lucius Stertinius was despatched by Germanicus with a flying column and routed the Bructeri as they were burning their possessions , and amid the carnage and plunder , found the eagle of the nineteenth legion which had been lost with Varus . <end>
<start> ductum inde agmen ad ultimos Bructerorum , quantumque Amisiam et Lupiam amnis inter vastatum , haud procul Teutoburgiensi saltu in quo reliquiae Vari legionumque insepultae dicebantur . <end>$$<start> The troops were then marched to the furthest frontier of the Bructeri , and all the country between the rivers Amisia and Luppia was ravaged , not far from the forest of Teutoburgium where the remains of Varus and his legions were said to lie unburied . <end>
<start> Igitur cupido Caesarem invadit solvendi suprema militibus ducique , permoto ad miserationem omni qui aderat exercitu ob propinquos , amicos , denique ob casus bellorum et sortem hominum . <end>$$<start> Germanicus upon this was seized with an eager longing to pay the last honour to those soldiers and their general , while the whole army present was moved to compassion by the thought of their kinsfolk and friends , and , indeed , of the calamities of wars and the lot of mankind . <end>
<start> praemisso Caecina ut occulta saltuum scrutaretur pontesque et aggeres umido paludum et fallacibus campis inponeret , incedunt maestos locos visuque ac memoria deformis . <end>$$<start> Having sent on Caecina in advance to reconnoitre the obscure forest-passes , and to raise bridges and causeways over watery swamps and treacherous plains , they visited the mournful scenes , with their horrible sights and associations . <end>
<start> prima Vari castra lato ambitu et dimensis principiis trium legionum manus ostentabant . <end>$$<start> Varus's first camp with its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly indicated the handiwork of three legions . <end>
<start> dein semiruto vallo , humili fossa accisae iam reliquiae consedisse intellegebantur medio campi albentia ossa , ut fugerant , ut restiterant , disiecta vel aggerata . <end>$$<start> Further on , the partially fallen rampart and the shallow fosse suggested the inference that it was a shattered remnant of the army which had there taken up a position . <end>
<start> adiacebant fragmina telorum equorumque artus , simul truncis arborum antefixa ora . <end>$$<start> In the centre of the field were the whitening bones of men , as they had fled , or stood their ground , strewn everywhere or piled in heaps . <end>
<start> Iucis propinquis barbarae arae , apud quas tribunos ac primorum ordinum centuriones mactaverant . <end>$$<start> Near , lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses , and also human heads , prominently nailed to trunks of trees . <end>
<start> et cladis eius superstites , pugnam aut vincula elapsi , referebant hic cecidisse legatos , illic raptas aquilas . <end>$$<start> In the adjacent groves were the barbarous altars , on which they had immolated tribunes and first-rank centurions . <end>
<start> quo tribunali contionatus Arminius , quot patibula captivis , quae scrobes , utque signis et aquilis per superbiam inluserit . <end>$$<start> They pointed out too the raised ground from which Arminius had harangued his army , the number of gibbets for the captives , the pits for the living , and how in his exultation he insulted the standards and eagles . <end>
<start> Igitur Romanus qui aderat exercitus sextum post cladis annum trium legionum ossa , nullo noscente alienas reliquias an suorum humo tegeret , omnis ut coniunctos , ut consanguineos , aucta in hostem ira , maesti simul et infensi condebant . <end>$$<start> And so the Roman army now on the spot , six years after the disaster , in grief and anger , began to bury the bones of the three legions , not a soldier knowing whether he was interring the relics of a relative or a stranger , but looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood , while their wrath rose higher than ever against the foe . <end>
<start> quod Tiberio haud probatum , seu cuncta Germanici in deterius trahenti , sive exercitum imagine caesorum insepultorumque tardatum ad proelia et formidolosiorem hostium credebat . <end>$$<start> In raising the barrow Caesar laid the first sod , rendering thus a most welcome honour to the dead , and sharing also in the sorrow of those present . <end>
<start> Sed Germanicus cedentem in avia Arminium secutus , ubi primum copia fuit , evehi equites campumque quem hostis insederat eripi iubet . <end>$$<start> Germanicus , however , pursued Arminius as he fell back into trackless wilds , and as soon as he had the opportunity , ordered his cavalry to sally forth and scour the plains occupied by the enemy . <end>
<start> Arminius colligi suos et propinquare silvis monitos vertit repente mox signum prorumpendi dedit iis quos per saltus occultaverat . <end>$$<start> Arminius having bidden his men to concentrate themselves and keep close to the woods , suddenly wheeled round , and soon gave those whom he had concealed in the forest passes the signal to rush to the attack . <end>
<start> tunc nova acie turbatus eques , missaeque subsidiariae cohortes et fugientium agmine impulsae auxerant consternationem . <end>$$<start> Thereupon our cavalry was thrown into disorder by this new force , and some cohorts in reserve were sent , which , broken by the shock of flying troops , increased the panic . <end>
<start> trudebanturque in paludem gnaram vincentibus , iniquam nesciis , ni Caesar productas legiones instruxisset inde hostibus terror , fiducia militi . <end>$$<start> They were being pushed into a swamp , well known to the victorious assailants , perilous to men unacquainted with it , when Caesar led forth his legions in battle array . <end>
<start> , mox reducto ad Amisiam exercitu legiones classe , ut ad vexerat , reportat . <end>$$<start> Part of the cavalry was ordered to make for the Rhine along the sea-coast . <end>
<start> Caecina , qui suum militem ducebat , monitus , quamquam notis itineribus regrederetur , pontes longos quam maturrime superare . <end>$$<start> This was a narrow road amid vast swamps , which had formerly been constructed by Lucius Domitius . <end>
<start> angustus is trames vastas inter paludes et quondam a Lucius Domitio aggeratus , cetera limosa , tenacia gravi caeno aut rivis incerta erant . <end>$$<start> on every side were quagmires of thick clinging mud , or perilous with streams . <end>
<start> circum silvae paulatim adclives , quas tum Arminius inplevit , compendiis viarum et cito agmine onustum sarcinis armisque militem cum antevenisset . <end>$$<start> Around were woods on a gradual slope , which Arminius now completely occupied , as soon as by a short route and quick march he had outstripped troops heavily laden with baggage and arms . <end>
<start> Caecinae dubitanti quonam modo ruptos vetustate pontes reponeret simulque propulsaret hostem , castra metari in loco placuit , ut opus et alii proelium inciperent . <end>$$<start> As Caecina was in doubt how he could possibly replace bridges which were ruinous from age , and at the same time hold back the enemy , he resolved to encamp on the spot , that some might begin the repair and others the attack . <end>
<start> Barbari perfringere stationes seque inferre munitoribus nisi lacessunt , circumgrediuntur , occursant miscetur operantium bellantiumque clamor . <end>$$<start> The barbarians attempted to break through the outposts and to throw themselves on the engineering parties , which they harassed , pacing round them and continually charging them . <end>
<start> contra Cheruscis sueta apud paludes proelia , procera membra , hastae ingentes ad vulnera facienda quamvis procul . <end>$$<start> Night at last released the legions , which were now wavering , from a disastrous engagement . <end>
<start> Germani ob prospera indefessi , ne tum quidem sumpta quiete , quantum aquarum circum surgentibus iugis oritur vertere in subiecta , mersaque humo et obruto quod effectum operis duplicatus militi labor . <end>$$<start> The ground being thus flooded and the completed portion of our works submerged , the soldiers' labour was doubled . <end>
<start> quadragesimum id stipendium Caecina parendi aut imperitandi habebat , secundarum ambiguarumque rerum sciens eoque interritus . <end>$$<start> This was Caecina's fortieth campaign as a subordinate or a commander , and , with such experience of success and peril , he was perfectly fearless . <end>
<start> igitur futura volvens non aliud repperit quam ut hostem silvis coerceret , donec saucii quantumque gravioris agminis anteirent . <end>$$<start> As he thought over future possibilities , he could devise no plan but to keep the enemy within the woods , till the wounded and the more encumbered troops were in advance . <end>
<start> nam medio montium et paludum porrigebatur planities , quae tenuem aciem pateretur . <end>$$<start> For between the hills and the swamps there stretched a plain which would admit of an extended line . <end>
<start> deliguntur legiones quinta dextro lateri , unetvicesima in laevum , primani ducendum ad agmen , vicesimanus adversum secuturos . <end>$$<start> The legions had their assigned places , the fifth on the right wing , the twenty-first on the left , the men of the first to lead the van , the twentieth to repel pursuers . <end>
<start> Nox per diversa inquies , cum barbari festis epulis , laeto cantu aut truci sonore subiecta vallium ac resultantis saltus complerent , apud Romanos invalidi ignes , interruptae voces , atque ipsi passim adiacerent vallo , oberrarent tentoriis , insomnes magis quam pervigiles . <end>$$<start> It was a restless night for different reasons , the barbarians in their festivity filling the valleys under the hills and the echoing glens with merry song or savage shouts , while in the Roman camp were flickering fires , broken exclamations , and the men lay scattered along the intrenchments or wandered from tent to tent , wakeful rather than watchful . <end>
<start> ducemque terruit dira quies nam Quintilium Varum sanguine oblitum et paludibus emersum cernere et audire visus est velut vocantem , non tamen obsecutus et manum intendentis reppulisse coepta luce missae in latera legiones , metu an contumacia , locum deseruere , capto propere campo umentia ultra . <end>$$<start> A ghastly dream appalled the general He seemed to see Quintilius Varus , covered with blood , rising out of the swamps , and to hear him , as it were , calling to him , but he did not , as he imagined , obey the call . <end>
<start> neque tamen Arminius quamquam libero incursu statim prorupit sed ut haesere caeno fossisque impedimenta , turbati circum milites , incertus signorum ordo , utque tali in tempore sibi quisque properus et lentae adversum imperia aures , inrumpere Germanos iubet , clamitans en Varus eodemque iterum fato vinctae legiones! simul haec et cum delectis scindit agmen equisque maxime vulnera ingerit . <end>$$<start> he even repelled his hand , as he stretched it over him At daybreak the legions , posted on the wings , from panic or perversity , deserted their position and hastily occupied a plain beyond the morass . <end>
<start> illi sanguine suo et lubrico paludum lapsantes excussis rectoribus disicere obvios , proterere iacentis . <end>$$<start> Yet Arminius , though free to attack , did not at the moment rush out on them . <end>
<start> Caecina dum sustentat aciem , suffosso equo delapsus circumveniebatur , ni prima legio sese opposuisset . <end>$$<start> Caecina , while he was keeping up the battle , fell from his horse , which was pierced under him , and was being hemmed in , when the first legion threw itself in the way . <end>
<start> iuvit hostium aviditas , omissa caede praedam sectantium , enisaeque legiones vesperascente die in aperta et solida . <end>$$<start> The greed of the foe helped him , for they left the slaughter to secure the spoil , and the legions , towards evening , struggled on to open and firm ground . <end>
<start> neque is miseriarum finis . <end>$$<start> Nor did this end their miseries . <end>
<start> struendum vallum , petendus agger , amissa magna ex parte per quae egeritur humus aut exciditur caespes . <end>$$<start> Entrenchments had to be thrown up , materials sought for earthworks , while the army had lost to a great extent their implements for digging earth and cutting turf . <end>
<start> non tentoria manipulis , non fomenta sauciis . <end>$$<start> There were no tents for the rank and file , no comforts for the wounded . <end>
<start> infectos caeno aut cruore cibos dividentes funestas tenebras et tot hominum milibus unum iam reliquum diem lamentabantur . <end>$$<start> As they shared their food , soiled by mire or blood , they bewailed the darkness with its awful omen , and the one day which yet remained to so many thousand men . <end>
<start> Forte equus abruptis vinculis vagus et clamore territus quosdam occurrentium obturbavit . <end>$$<start> It chanced that a horse , which had broken its halter and wandered wildly in fright at the uproar , overthrew some men against whom it dashed . <end>
<start> Tunc contractos in principia iussosque dicta cum silentio accipere temporis ac necessitatis monet . <end>$$<start> Having then assembled them at his headquarters , and ordered them to hear his words in silence , he reminded them of the urgency of the crisis . <end>
<start> unam in armis salutem , sed ea consilio temperanda manendumque intra vallum , donec expugnandi hostis spe propius succederent . <end>$$<start> Their safety , he said , lay in their arms , which they must , however , use with discretion , and they must remain within the entrenchments , till the enemy approached closer , in the hope of storming them . <end>
<start> mox undique erumpendum illa eruptione ad Rhenum perveniri . <end>$$<start> then , there must be a general sortie . <end>
<start> quae domi cara , quae in castris honesta , memorat . <end>$$<start> but if they were victorious , glory and renown would be theirs . <end>
<start> equos dehinc , orsus a suis , legatorum tribunorumque nulla ambitione fortissimo cuique bellatori tradit , ut hi , mox pedes in hostem invaderent . <end>$$<start> Next he handed over the horses , beginning with his own , of the officers and tribunes , to the bravest fighters in the army , quite impartially , that these first , and then the infantry , might charge the enemy . <end>
<start> Haud minus inquies Cermanus spe , cupidine et diversis ducum sententiis agebat , Arminio sinerent egredi egressosque rursum per umida et inpedita circumvenirent suadente , atrociora Inguiomero et laeta barbaris , ut vallum armis ambirent promptam expugnationem , plures captivos , incorruptam praedam fore . <end>$$<start> There was as much restlessness in the German host with its hopes , its eager longings , and the conflicting opinions of its chiefs Arminius advised that they should allow the Romans to quit their position , and , when they had quitted it , again surprise them in swampy and intricate ground . <end>
<start> igitur orta die proruunt fossas , iniciunt cratis , summa valli prensant , raro super milite et quasi ob metum defixo . <end>$$<start> Inguiomerus , with fiercer counsels , heartily welcome to barbarians , was for beleaguering the entrenchment in armed array , as to storm them would , he said , be easy , and there would be more prisoners and the booty unspoilt . <end>
<start> hosti facile excidium et paucos ac semermos cogitanti sonus tubarum , fulgor armorum , quanto inopina tanto maiora offunduntur , cadebantque , ut rebus secundis avidi , ita adversis incauti . <end>$$<start> Arminius and Inguiomerus fled from the battle , the first unhurt , the other severely wounded . <end>
<start> Arminius integer , Inguiomerus post grave vulnus pugnam deseruere vulgus trucidatum est , donec ira et dies permansit . <end>$$<start> Their followers were slaughtered , as long as our fury and the light of day lasted . <end>
<start> nocte demum reversae legiones , quamvis plus vulnerum , eadem ciborum egestas fatigaret , vim sanitatem copias , cuncta in victoria habuere . <end>$$<start> It was not till night that the legions returned , and though more wounds and the same want of provisions distressed them , yet they found strength , healing , sustenance , everything indeed , in their victory . <end>
<start> Penaserat interim circumventi exercitus fama et infesto Germanorum agmine Gallias peti , ac ni Agrippina inpositum Rheno pontem solvi prohibuisset , erant qui id fiagitium formidine auderent . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile a rumour had spread that our army was cut off , and that a furious German host was marching on Gaul . <end>
<start> sed femina ingens animi munia ducis per eos dies induit , militibusque , ut quis inops aut saucius , vestem et fomenta dilargita est . <end>$$<start> And had not Agrippina prevented the bridge over the Rhine from being destroyed , some in their cowardice would have dared that base act . <end>
<start> tradit Gaius Plinius Germanicorum bellorum scriptor , stetisse apud principium ponti laudes et grates reversis legionibus habentem . <end>$$<start> A woman of heroic spirit , she assumed during those days the duties of a general , and distributed clothes or medicine among the soldiers , as they were destitute or wounded . <end>
<start> id Tiberii animum altius penetravit non enim simplicis eas curas , nec adversus externos studia militum quaeri . <end>$$<start> According to Caius Plinius , the historian of the German wars , she stood at the extremity of the bridge , and bestowed praise and thanks on the returning legions . <end>
<start> nihil relictum imperatoribus , ubi femina manipulos intervisat , signa adeat , largitionem temptet , tamquam parum ambitiose filium ducis gregali habitu circumferat Caesaremque Caligulam appellari velit . <end>$$<start> This made a deep impression on the mind of Tiberius Such zeal , he thought , could not be guileless . <end>
<start> potiorem iam apud exercitus Agrippinam quam legatos , quam duces . <end>$$<start> it was not against a foreign foe that she was thus courting the soldiers . <end>
<start> accendebat haec onerabatque Seianus , peritia morum Tiberii odia in longum iaciens , quae reconderet auctaque promeret . <end>$$<start> All this was inflamed and aggravated by Sejanus , who , with his thorough comprehension of the character of Tiberius , sowed for a distant future hatreds which the emperor might treasure up and might exhibit when fully matured . <end>
<start> At Germanicus legionum , quas navibus vexerat , secundam et quartam decimam itinere terrestri Publius Vitellio ducendas tradit , quo levior classis vadoso mari innaret vel reciproco sideret . <end>$$<start> Of the legions which he had conveyed by ship , Germanicus gave the second and fourteenth to Publius Vitellius , to be marched by land , so that the fleet might sail more easily over a sea full of shoals , or take the ground more lightly at the ebb-tide . <end>
<start> Vitellius primum iter sicca humo aut modice adlabente aestu quietum habuit mox inpulsu aquilonis , simul sidere aequinoctii , quo maxime tumescit Oceanus , rapi agique agmen . <end>$$<start> Vitellius at first pursued his route without interruption , having a dry shore , or the waves coming in gently . <end>
<start> et opplebantur terrae eadem freto litori campis facies , neque discemi poterant incerta ab solidis , brevia a profundis . <end>$$<start> After a while , through the force of the north wind and the equinoctial season , when the sea swells to its highest , his army was driven and tossed hither and thither . <end>
<start> sternuntur fluctibus , hauriuntur gurgitibus . <end>$$<start> The country too was flooded . <end>
<start> permiscentur inter se manipuli , modo pectore , modo ore tenus extantes , aliquando subtracto solo disiecti aut obruti . <end>$$<start> There was nothing to distinguish the brave from the coward , the prudent from the careless , forethought from chance . <end>
<start> non vox et mutui hortatus iuvabant adversante unda . <end>$$<start> the same strong power swept everything before it . <end>
<start> nihil strenuus ab ignavo , sapiens ab inprudenti , consilia a casu differre cuncta pari violentia involvebantur . <end>$$<start> At last Vitellius struggled out to higher ground and led his men up to it . <end>
<start> pernoctavere sine utensilibus , sine igni , magna pars nudo aut mulcato corpore , haud minus miserabiles quam quos hostis circumsidet quippe illic etiam honestae mortis usus , his inglorium exitium . <end>$$<start> For such , at least , have the opportunity of a glorious death , while here was destruction without honour . <end>
<start> Iux reddidit terram , penetratumque ad amnem Visurgin , quo Caesar classe contenderat . <end>$$<start> Daylight restored land to their sight , and they pushed their way to the river Visurgis , where Caesar had arrived with the fleet . <end>
<start> in positae dein legiones , vagante fama submersas . <end>$$<start> The legions then embarked , while a rumour was flying about that they were drowned . <end>
<start> nec fides salutis , antequam Caesarem exercitumque reducem videre . <end>$$<start> Nor was there a belief in their safety till they saw Caesar and the army returned . <end>
<start> Iam Stertinius , ad accipiendum in deditionem Segimerum fratrem Segestis praemissus , ipsum et filium eius in civitatem Vbiorum perduxerat . <end>$$<start> By this time Stertinius , who had been despatched to receive the surrender of Segimerus , brother of Segestes , had conducted the chief , together with his son , to the canton of the Ubii . <end>
<start> data utrique venia , facile Segimero , cunctantius filio , quia Quintilii Vari corpus inlusisse dicebatur . <end>$$<start> Both were pardoned , Segimerus readily , the son with some hesitation , because it was said that he had insulted the corpse of Quintilius Varus . <end>
<start> ceterum ad supplenda exercitus damna certavere Galliae Hispaniae Italia , quod cuique promptum , arma equos aurum offerentes . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile Gaul , Spain , and Italy vied in repairing the losses of the army , offering whatever they had at hand , arms , horses , gold . <end>
<start> quorum laudato studio Germanicus , armis modo et equis ad bellum sumptis , propria pecunia militem iuvit . <end>$$<start> Germanicus having praised their zeal , took only for the war their arms and horses , and relieved the soldiers out of his own purse . <end>
<start> utque cladis memoriam etiam comitate leniret , circumire saucios , facta singulorum extollere vulnera intuens alium spe , alium gloria , cunctos adloquio et cura sibique et proelio firmabat . <end>$$<start> And that he might also soften the remembrance of the disaster by kindness , he went round to the wounded , applauded the feats of soldier after soldier , examined their wounds , raised the hopes of one , the ambition of another , and the spirits of all by his encouragement and interest , thus strengthening their ardour for himself and for battle . <end>
<start> Decreta eo anno triumphalia insignia Aulus Caecinae , Lucius Apronio , Gaius Silio ob res cum Germanico gestas . <end>$$<start> That year triumphal honours were decreed to Aulus Caecina , Lucius Apronius , Caius Silius for their achievements under Germanicus . <end>
<start> non tamen ideo faciebat fidem civilis animi . <end>$$<start> Deeds only were liable to accusation . <end>
<start> primus Augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis specie legis eius tractavit , commotus Cassii Severi libidine , qua viros feminasque inlustris procacibus scriptis diffamaverat . <end>$$<start> It was Augustus who first , under colour of this law , applied legal inquiry to libellous writings provoked , as he had been , by the licentious freedom with which Cassius Severus had defamed men and women of distinction in his insulting satires . <end>
<start> mox Tiberius , consultante Pompeio Macro praetore an iudicia maiestatis redderentur , exercendas leges esse re spondit . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards , Tiberius , when consulted by Pompeius Macer , the praetor , as to whether prosecutions for treason should be revived , replied that the laws must be enforced . <end>
<start> hunc quoque asperavere carmina incertis auctoribus vulgata in saevitiam superbiamque eius et discordem cum matre animum . <end>$$<start> He too had been exasperated by the publication of verses of uncertain authorship , pointed at his cruelty , his arrogance , and his dissensions with his mother . <end>
<start> Haud pigebit referre in Falanio et Rubrio , modicis equitibus Romanis , praetemptata crimina , ut quibus initiis , quanta Tiberii arte gravissimum exitium inrepserit , dein repressum sit , postremo arserit cunctaque corripuerit , noscatur . <end>$$<start> It will not be uninteresting if I relate in the cases of Falanius and Rubrius , Roman knights of moderate fortune , the first experiments at such accusations , in order to explain the origin of a most terrible scourge , how by Tiberius's cunning it crept in among us , how subsequently it was checked , finally , how it burst into flame and consumed everything . <end>
<start> quae ubi Tiberio notuere , scripsit consulibus non ideo decretum patri suo caelum , ut in perniciem civium is honor verteretur . <end>$$<start> Cassius , the actor , with men of the same profession , used to take part in the games which had been consecrated by his mother to the memory of Augustus . <end>
<start> Cassium histrionem solitum inter alios eiusdem artis interesse ludis , quos mater sua in me moriam Augusti sacrasset . <end>$$<start> Nor was it contrary to the religion of the State for the emperor's image , like those of other deities , to be added to a sale of gardens and houses . <end>
<start> nec contra religiones fieri quod effigies eius , ut alia numinum simulacra , venditionibus hortorum et domuum accedant . <end>$$<start> As to the oath , the thing ought to be considered as if the man had deceived Jupiter . <end>
<start> Nec multo post Granium Marcellum praetorem Bithyniae quaestor ipsius Caepio Crispinus maiestatis postulavit , subscribente Romano Hispone qui formam vitae iniit , quam postea celebrem miseriae temporum et audaciae hominum fecerunt . <end>$$<start> Not long afterwards , Granius Marcellus , proconsul of Bithynia , was accused of treason by his quaestor , Caepio Crispinus , and the charge was supported by Romanus Hispo . <end>
<start> nam egens , ignotus , inquies , dum occultis libellis saevitiae principis adrepit , mox clarissimo cuique periculum facessit , potentiam apud unum , odium apud omnis adeptus dedit exemplum , quod secuti ex pauperibus divites , ex contemptis metuendi perniciem aliis ac postremum sibi invenere . <end>$$<start> Crispinus then entered on a line of life afterwards rendered notorious by the miseries of the age and men's shamelessness Needy , obscure , and restless , he wormed himself by stealthy informations into the confidence of a vindictive prince , and soon imperilled all the most distinguished citizens . <end>
<start> sed Marcellum insimulabat sinistros de Tiberio sermones habuisse , inevitabile crimen , cum ex moribus principis foedissima quaeque deligeret accusator obiectaretque reo . <end>$$<start> and having thus gained influence with one , hatred from all besides , he left an example in following which beggars became wealthy , the insignificant , formidable , and brought ruin first on others , finally on themselves . <end>
<start> manebant etiam tum vestigia morientis libertatis . <end>$$<start> If first , I shall know what to follow . <end>
<start> igitur Gnaeus Piso quo inquit loco censebis , Caesar . <end>$$<start> if last , I fear that I may differ from you unwillingly . <end>
<start> Nec patrum cognitionibus satiatus iudiciis adsidebat in cornu tribunalis , ne praetorem curuli depelleret . <end>$$<start> Not satisfied with judicial proceedings in the Senate , the emperor would sit at one end of the Praetor's tribunal , but so as not to displace him from the official seat . <end>
<start> multaque eo coram adversus ambitum et potentium preces constituta . <end>$$<start> Many decisions were given in his presence , in opposition to improper influence and the solicitations of great men . <end>
<start> sed dum veritilti consulitur , libertas corrumpebatur . <end>$$<start> This , though it promoted justice , ruined freedom . <end>
<start> inter quae Pius Aurelius senator questus mole publicae viae ductuque aquarum labefactas aedis suas , auxilium patrum invocabat . <end>$$<start> Pius Aurelius , for example , a senator , complained that the foundations of his house had been weakened by the pressure of a public road and aqueduct , and he appealed to the Senate for assistance . <end>
<start> resistentibus aerarii praetoribus subvenit Caesar pretiumque aedium Aurelio tribuit , erogandae per honesta pecuniae cupiens , quam virtutem diu retinuit , cum ceteras exueret . <end>$$<start> He was opposed by the praetors of the treasury , but the emperor helped him , and paid him the value of his house , for he liked to spend money on a good purpose , a virtue which he long retained , when he cast off all others . <end>
<start> Propertio Celeri praetorio , veniam ordinis ob paupertatem petenti , decies sestertium largitus est , satis conperto paternas ei angustias esse . <end>$$<start> To Propertius Celer , an ex-praetor , who sought because of his indigence to be excused from his rank as a senator , he gave a million sesterces , having ascertained that he had inherited poverty . <end>
<start> temptantis eadem alios probare causam senatui iussit , cupidine severitatis in iis etiam quae rite faceret acerbus . <end>$$<start> He bade others , who attempted the same , prove their case to the Senate , as from his love of strictness he was harsh even where he acted on right grounds . <end>
<start> unde ceteri silentium et paupertatem confessioni et beneficio praeposuere . <end>$$<start> Consequently every one else preferred silence and poverty to confession and relief . <end>
<start> Eodem anno continuis imbribus auctus Tiberis plana urbis stagnaverat . <end>$$<start> In the same year the Tiber , swollen by continuous rains , flooded the level portions of the city . <end>
<start> relabentem secuta est aedificiorum et hominum strages . <end>$$<start> Its subsidence was followed by a destruction of buildings and of life . <end>
<start> igitur censuit Asinius Gallus ut libri Sibyllini adirentur . <end>$$<start> Thereupon Asinius Gallus proposed to consult the Sibylline books . <end>
<start> Renuit Tiberius , perinde divina humanaque obtegens . <end>$$<start> Tiberius refused , veiling in obscurity the divine as well as the human . <end>
<start> sed remedium coercendi fluminis Ateio Calpitoni et Lucius Arruntio mandatum . <end>$$<start> However , the devising of means to confine the river was intrusted to Ateius Capito and Lucius Arruntius . <end>
<start> Achaiam ac Macedoniam onera deprecantis levari in praesens proconsulari imperio tradique Caesari placuit . <end>$$<start> Achaia and Macedonia , on complaining of their burdens , were , it was decided , to be relieved for a time from proconsular government and to be transferred to the emperor . <end>
<start> edendis gladiatoribus , quos Germanici fratris ac suo nomine obtulerat , Drusus praesedit , quamquam vili sanguine nimis gaudens . <end>$$<start> Drusus presided over a show of gladiators which he gave in his own name and in that of his brother Germanicus , for he gloated intensely over bloodshed , however cheap its victims . <end>
<start> quod in vugus formidolosum et pater arguisse dicebatur . <end>$$<start> This was alarming to the populace , and his father had , it was said , rebuked him . <end>
<start> cur abstinuerit spectaculo ipse , varie trahebant . <end>$$<start> Why Tiberius kept away from the spectacle was variously explained . <end>
<start> alii taedio coetus , quidam tristitia ingenii et metu conparationis , quia Augustus comiter interfuisset . <end>$$<start> According to some , it was his loathing of a crowd , according to others , his gloomy temper , and a fear of contrast with the gracious presence of Augustus . <end>
<start> non crediderim ad ostentandam saevitiam movendasque populi offensiones concessam filio materiem , quamquam id quoque dictum est . <end>$$<start> I cannot believe that he deliberately gave his son the opportunity of displaying his ferocity and provoking the people's disgust , though even this was said . <end>
<start> At theatri licentia , proximo priore anno coepta , gravius tum erupit , occisis non modo e plebe set militibus et centurione , vulnerato tribuno praetoriae cohortis , dum probra in magistratus et dissensionem vulgi prohibent . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile the unruly tone of the theatre which first showed itself in the preceding year , broke out with worse violence , and some soldiers and a centurion , besides several of the populace , were killed , and the tribune of a praetorian cohort was wounded , while they were trying to stop insults to the magistrates and the strife of the mob . <end>
<start> actum de ea seditione apud patres dicebanturque sententiae , ut praetoribus ius virgarum in histriones esset . <end>$$<start> This disturbance was the subject of a debate in the Senate , and opinions were expressed in favour of the praetors having authority to scourge actors . <end>
<start> intercessit Haterius Agrippa tribunus plebei increpitusque est Asinii Galli oratione , silente Tiberio , qui ea simulacra libertatis senatui praebebat . <end>$$<start> Haterius Agrippa , tribune of the people , interposed his veto , and was sharply censured in a speech from Asinius Gallus , without a word from Tiberius , who liked to allow the Senate such shows of freedom . <end>
<start> valuit tamen intercessio , quia divus Augustus immunis verberum histriones quondam responderat , neque fas Tiberio infringere dicta eius . <end>$$<start> Still the interposition was successful , because Augustus had once pronounced that actors were exempt from the scourge , and it was not lawful for Tiberius to infringe his decisions . <end>
<start> de modo lucaris et adversus lasciviam fautorum multa decernuntur . <end>$$<start> Many enactments were passed to fix the amount of their pay and to check the disorderly behaviour of their partisans . <end>
<start> ex quis maxime insignia , ne domos pantomimorum senator introiret , ne egredientis in publicum equites Romani cingerent aut alibi quam in theatro spectarentur , et spectantium immodestiam exilio multandi potestas praetoribus fieret . <end>$$<start> Of these the chief were that no Senator should enter the house of a pantomime player , that Roman knights should not crowd round them in the public streets , that they should exhibit themselves only in the theatre , and that the praetors should be empowered to punish with banishment any riotous conduct in the spectators . <end>
<start> Templum ut in colonia Tarraconensi strueretur Augusto petentibus Hispanis permissum , datumque in omnis provincias exemplum . <end>$$<start> A request from the Spaniards that they might erect a temple to Augustus in the colony of Tarraco was granted , and a precedent thus given for all the provinces . <end>
<start> centesimam rerum venalium post bella civilia institutam deprecante populo edixit Tiberius militare aerarium eo subsidio niti simul imparem oneri rem publicam , nisi vicesimo militiae anno veterani dimitterentur . <end>$$<start> When the people of Rome asked for a remission of the one per cent tax on all saleable commodities , Tiberius declared by edict that the military exchequer depended on that branch of revenue , and , further , that the State was unequal to the burden , unless the twentieth year of service were to be that of the veteran's discharge . <end>
<start> ita proximae seditionis male consulta , quibus sedecim stipendiorum finem expresserant , abolita in posterum . <end>$$<start> Thus the ill-advised results of the late mutiny , by which a limit of sixteen campaigns had been extorted , were cancelled for the future . <end>
<start> Actum deinde in senatu ab Arruntio et Ateio an ob moderandas Tiberis exundationes verterentur flumina et lacus , per quos augescit . <end>$$<start> A question was then raised in the Senate by Arruntius and Ateius whether , in order to restrain the inundations of the Tiber , the rivers and lakes which swell its waters should be diverted from their courses . <end>
<start> auditaeque municipiorum et coloniarum legationes , orantibus Florentinis ne Clanis solito alveo demotus in amnem Arnum transferretur idque ipsis perniciem adferret . <end>$$<start> Similar arguments were used by the inhabitants of Interamna The most fruitful plains of Italy , they said , would be destroyed if the river Nar (for this was the plan proposed) were to be divided into several streams and overflow the country . <end>
<start> congruentia his Interamnates disseruere pessum ituros fecundissimos Italiae campos , si amnis Nar (id enim parabatur) in rivos diductus supersta gnavisset . <end>$$<start> Nor did the people of Reate remain silent They remonstrated against the closing up of the Veline lake , where it empties itself into the Nar , as it would burst in a flood on the entire neighbourhood . <end>
<start> nec Reatini silebant , Velinum lacum , qua in Narem effunditur , obstrui recusantes , quippe in adiacentia erupturum . <end>$$<start> Nature had admirably provided for human interests in having assigned to rivers their mouths , their channels , and their limits , as well as their sources . <end>
<start> optume rebus mortalium consuluisse naturam , quae sua ora fluminibus , suos cursus utque originem , ita finis dederit . <end>$$<start> Regard , too , must be paid to the different religions of the allies , who had dedicated sacred rites , groves , and altars to the rivers of their country . <end>
<start> spectandas etiam religiones sociorum , qui sacra et lucos et aras patriis amnibus dicaverint quin ipsum Tiberim nolle prorsus accolis fluviis orbatum minore gloria fluere . <end>$$<start> Tiber himself would be altogether unwilling to be deprived of his neighbour streams and to flow with less glory . <end>
<start> Prorogatur Poppaeo Sabino provincia Moesia , additis Achaia ac Macedonia . <end>$$<start> Poppaeus Sabinus was continued in his government of the province of Moesia with the addition of Achaia and Macedonia . <end>
<start> id quoque morum Tiberii fuit , continuare imperia ac plerosque ad finem vitae in isdem exercitibus aut iurisdictionibus habere . <end>$$<start> Various motives have been assigned for this Some say that , out of aversion to any fresh anxiety , he retained what he had once approved as a permanent arrangement . <end>
<start> neque enim eminentis virtutes sectabatur , et rursum vitia oderat ex optimis periculum sibi , a pessimis dedecus publicum metuebat . <end>$$<start> From the best men he apprehended danger to himself , from the worst , disgrace to the State . <end>
<start> De comitiis consularibus , quae tum primum illo principe ac deinceps fuere , vix quicquam firmare ausim adeo diversa non modo apud auctores , sed in ipsius orationibus reperiuntur . <end>$$<start> I can hardly venture on any positive statement about the consular elections , now held for the first time under this emperor , or , indeed , subsequently , so conflicting are the accounts we find not only in historians but in Tiberius' own speeches . <end>
<start> modo subtractis candidatorum nominibus originem cuiusque et vitam et stipendia descripsit ut qui forent intellegeretur . <end>$$<start> Sometimes he kept back the names of the candidates , describing their origin , their life and military career , so that it might be understood who they were . <end>
<start> aliquando ea quoque significatione sub tracta candidatos hortatus ne ambitu comitia turbarent , suam ad id curam pollicitus est . <end>$$<start> Occasionally even these hints were withheld , and , after urging them not to disturb the elections by canvassing , he would promise his own help towards the result . <end>
<start> posse et alios profiteri , si gratiae aut meritis confiderent speciosa verbis , re inania aut subdola , quantoque maiore libertatis imagine tegebantur , tanto eruptura ad infensius servitium . <end>$$<start> A plausible profession this in words , but really unmeaning and delusive , and the greater the disguise of freedom which marked it , the more cruel the enslavement into which it was soon to plunge us . <end>
<start> Sisenna Statilio Tauro Lucius Libone consulibus mota Orientis regna provinciaeque Romanae , initio apud Parthos orto , qui petitum Roma acceptumque regem , quamvis gentis Arsacidarum , ut externum aspernabantur . <end>$$<start> IN the consulship of Sisenna Statilius Taurus and Lucius Libo there was a commotion in the kingdoms and Roman provinces of the East . <end>
<start> nam Phraates quamquam depulisset exercitus ducesque Romanos , cuncta venerantium officia ad Augustum verterat partemque prolis firmandae amicitiae miserat , haud perinde nostri metu quam fidei popularium diffisus . <end>$$<start> For although he had driven before him armies and generals from Rome , Phraates had shown to Augustus every token of reverence and had sent him some of his children , to cement the friendship , not so much from dread of us as from distrust of the loyalty of his countrymen . <end>
<start> Post finem Phraatis et sequentium regum ob internas caedis venere in urbem legati a primoribus Parthis , qui Vononem vetustissimum liberorum eius accirent . <end>$$<start> After the death of Phraates and the succeeding kings in the bloodshed of civil wars , there came to Rome envoys from the chief men of Parthia , in quest of Vonones , his eldest son . <end>
<start> magnificum id sibi credidit Caesar auxitque opibus . <end>$$<start> Caesar thought this a great honour to himself , and loaded Vonones with wealth . <end>
<start> et accepere barbari laetantes , ut ferme ad nova imperia . <end>$$<start> The barbarians , too , welcomed him with rejoicing , as is usual with new rulers . <end>
<start> mox subiit pudor degeneravisse Parthos petitum alio ex orbe regem , hostium artibus infectum iam inter provincias Romanas solium Arsacidarum haberi darique . <end>$$<start> Soon they felt shame at Parthians having become degenerate , at their having sought a king from another world , one too infected with the training of the enemy , at the throne of the Arsacids now being possessed and given away among the provinces of Rome . <end>
<start> ubi illam gloriam trucidantium Crassum , exturbantium Antonium , si mancipium Caesaris , tot per annos servitutem perpessum , Parthis imperitet . <end>$$<start> Where , they asked , was the glory of the men who slew Crassus , who drove out Antonius , if Caesar's drudge , after an endurance of so many years' slavery , were to rule over Parthians . <end>
<start> quotiens per urbes incederet , lecticae gestamine fastuque erga patrias epulas . <end>$$<start> They also ridiculed his Greek attendants and his keeping under seal the commonest household articles . <end>
<start> sed prompti aditus , obvia comitas , ignotae Parthis virtutes , nova vitia . <end>$$<start> his courtesy was open to all , and he had thus virtues with which the Parthians were unfamiliar , and vices new to them . <end>
<start> et quia ipsorum moribus aliena perinde odium pravis et honestis . <end>$$<start> And as his ways were quite alien from theirs they hated alike what was bad and what was good in him . <end>
<start> Igitur Artabanus Arsacidarum e sanguine apud Dahas adultus excitur , primoque congressu fusus reparat viris regnoque potitur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly they summoned Artabanus , an Arsacid by blood , who had grown to manhood among the Dahae , and who , though routed in the first encounter , rallied his forces and possessed himself of the kingdom . <end>
<start> victo Vononi perfugium Armenia fuit , vacua tunc interque Parthorum et Romanas opes infida ob scelus Antonii , qui Artavasden regem Armeniorum specie amicitiae inlectum , dein catenis oneratum , postremo interfecerat . <end>$$<start> The conquered Vonones found a refuge in Armenia , then a free country , and exposed to the power of Parthia and Rome , without being trusted by either , in consequence of the crime of Antonius , who , under the guise of friendship , had inveigled Artavasdes , king of the Armenians , then loaded him with chains , and finally murdered him . <end>
<start> eius filius Artaxias , memoria patris nobis infensus , Arsacidarum vi seque regnumque tutatus est . <end>$$<start> His son , Artaxias , our bitter foe because of his father's memory , found defence for himself and his kingdom in the might of the Arsacids . <end>
<start> occiso Artaxia per dolum propinquorum datus a Caesare Armeniis Tigranes deductusque in regnum a Tiberio Nerone . <end>$$<start> When he was slain by the treachery of kinsmen , Caesar gave Tigranes to the Armenians , and he was put in possession of the kingdom under the escort of Tiberius Nero . <end>
<start> nec Tigrani diuturnum imperium fuit neque liberis eius , quamquam sociatis more externo in matrimonium regnumque . <end>$$<start> But neither Tigranes nor his children reigned long , though , in foreign fashion , they were united in marriage and in royal power . <end>
<start> Dein iussu Augusti inpositus Artavasdes et non sine clade nostra deiectus . <end>$$<start> Next , at the bidding of Augustus , Artavasdes was set on the throne , nor was he deposed without disaster to ourselves . <end>
<start> tum Gaius Caesar componendae Armeniae deligitur . <end>$$<start> Caius Caesar was then appointed to restore order in Armenia . <end>
<start> is Ariobarzanen , origine Medum , ob insignem corporis formam et praeclarum animum volentibus Armeniis praefecit . <end>$$<start> He put over the Armenians Ariobarzanes , a Mede by birth , whom they willingly accepted , because of his singularly handsome person and noble spirit . <end>
<start> Ariobantane morte fortuita absumpto stirpem eius haud toleravere . <end>$$<start> On the death of Ariobarzanes through a fatal accident , they would not endure his son . <end>
<start> temptatoque feminae imperio , cui nomen Erato , eaque brevi pulsa , incerti solutique et magis sine domino quam in libertate profugum Vononen in regnum accipiunt . <end>$$<start> Having tried the government of a woman named Erato and having soon afterwards driven her from them , bewildered and disorganised , rather indeed without a ruler than enjoying freedom , they received for their king the fugitive Vonones . <end>
<start> sed ubi minitari Artabanus et parum subsidii in Armeniis , vel , si nostra vi defenderetur , bellum adversus Parthos sumendum erat , rector Syriae Creticus Silanus excitum custodia circumdat , manente luxu et regio nomine . <end>$$<start> When , however , Artabanus began to threaten , and but feeble support could be given by the Armenians , or war with Parthia would have to be undertaken , if Vonones was to be upheld by our arms , the governor of Syria , Creticus Silanus , sent for him and kept him under surveillance , letting him retain his royal pomp and title . <end>
<start> quod ludibrium ut effugere agitaverit Vonones in loco reddemus . <end>$$<start> How Vonones meditated an escape from this mockery , I will relate in the proper place . <end>
<start> Ceterum Tiberio haud ingratum accidit turbari res Orientis , ut ea specie Germanicum suetis legionibus abstraheret novisque provinciis impositum dolo simul et casibus obiectaret . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile the commotion in the East was rather pleasing to Tiberius , as it was a pretext for withdrawing Germanicus from the legions which knew him well , and placing him over new provinces where he would be exposed both to treachery and to disasters . <end>
<start> at ille , quanto acriora in eum studia militum et aversa patrui voluntas , celerandae victoriae intentior , tractare proeliorum vias et quae sibi tertium iam annum belligeranti saeva vel prospera evenissent . <end>$$<start> Germanicus , however , in proportion to the strength of the soldiers' attachment and to his uncle's dislike , was eager to hasten his victory , and he pondered on plans of battle , and on the reverses or successes which during more than three years of war had fallen to his lot . <end>
<start> fundi Germanos acie et iustis locis , iuvari silvis , paludibus , brevi aestate et praematura hieme . <end>$$<start> The Germans , he knew , were beaten in the field and on fair ground . <end>
<start> suum militem haud perinde vulneribus quam spatiis itinerum , damno armorum adfici . <end>$$<start> they were helped by woods , swamps , short summers , and early winters . <end>
<start> longum impedimentorum agmen opportunum ad insidias , defensantibus iniquum . <end>$$<start> Gaul had been exhausted by supplying horses . <end>
<start> at si mare intretur , promptam ipsis possessionem et hostibus ignotam , simul bellum maturius incipi legionesque et commeatus pariter vehi . <end>$$<start> a long baggage-train presented facilities for ambuscades , and was embarrassing to its defenders . <end>
<start> Igitur huc intendit , missis ad census Galliarum Publius Vitellio et Gaius Antio . <end>$$<start> To this accordingly he gave his mind , and sent Publius Vitellius and Caius Antius to collect the taxes of Gaul . <end>
<start> Silius et Anteius et Caecina fabricandae classi praeponuntur . <end>$$<start> Silius , Anteius , and Caecina had the charge of building a fleet . <end>
<start> mille naves sufficere visae properataeque , aliae breves , angusta puppi proraque et lato utero , quo facilius fluctus tolerarent . <end>$$<start> It seemed that a thousand vessels were required , and they were speedily constructed , some of small draught with a narrow stem and stern and a broad centre , that they might bear the waves more easily . <end>
<start> quaedam planae carinis , ut sine noxa siderent . <end>$$<start> some flat-bottomed , that they might ground without being injured . <end>
<start> plures adpositis utrimque gubernaculis , converso ut repente remigio hinc vel illinc adpellerent . <end>$$<start> several , furnished with a rudder at each end , so that by a sudden shifting of the oars they might be run into shore either way . <end>
<start> velis habiles , citae remis augebantur alacritate militum in speciem ac terrorem . <end>$$<start> On the Gallic bank , its flow is broader and gentler . <end>
<start> insula Batavorum in quam convenirent praedicta , ob facilis adpulsus accipiendisque copiis et transmittendum ad bellum opportuna . <end>$$<start> it is called by an altered name , the Vahal , by the inhabitants of its shore . <end>
<start> Sed Caesar , dum adiguntur naves , Silium legatum cum expedita manu inruptionem in Chattos facere iubet ipse audito castellum Lupiae flumini adpositum obsideri , sex legiones eo duxit . <end>$$<start> Caesar , however , while the vessels were coming up , ordered Silius , his lieutenant-general , to make an inroad on the Chatti with a flying column . <end>
<start> neque Silio ob subitos imbris aliud actum quam ut modicam praedam et Arpi principis Chattorum coniagem filiamque raperet , neque Caesari copiam pugnae opsessores fecere , ad famam adventus eius dilapsi tumulum tamen nuper Varianis legionibus structum et veterem aram Druso sitam disiecerant . <end>$$<start> He himself , on hearing that a fort on the river Luppia was being besieged , led six legions to the spot Silius owing to sudden rains did nothing but carry off a small booty , and the wife and daughter of Arpus , the chief of the Chatti . <end>
<start> restituit aram honorique patris princeps ipse cum legionibus decucurrit . <end>$$<start> And Caesar had no opportunity of fighting given him by the besiegers , who dispersed on the rumour of his advance . <end>
<start> et cuncta inter castellum Alisonem ac Rhenum novis limitibus aggeribusque permunita . <end>$$<start> All the country between the fort Aliso and the Rhine was thoroughly secured by new barriers and earthworks . <end>
<start> Iamque classis advenerat , cum praemisso commeatu et distributis in legiones ac socios navibus fossam , cui Drusianae nomen , ingressus precatusque Drusum patrem ut se eadem ausum libens placatusque exemplo ac memoria consiliorum atque operum iuvaret , lacus inde et Oceanum usque ad Amisiam flumen secunda navigatione pervehitur . <end>$$<start> By this time the fleet had arrived , and Caesar , having sent on his supplies and assigned vessels for the legions and the allied troops , entered Drusus's fosse , as it was called . <end>
<start> metanti castra Caesari Angrivariorum defectio a tergo nuntiatur missus ilico Stertinius cum equite et armatura levi igne et caedibus perfidiam ultus est . <end>$$<start> He at once despatched Stertinius with some cavalry and a light armed force , who punished their perfidy with fire and sword . <end>
<start> Flumen Visurgis Romanos Cheruscosque interfluebat . <end>$$<start> The waters of the Visurgis flowed between the Romans and the Cherusci . <end>
<start> erat is in exercitu cognomento Flavus , insignis fide et amisso per vulnus oculo paucis ante annis duce Tiberio . <end>$$<start> He asked whether Caesar had arrived , and on the reply that he was present , he begged leave to have an interview with his brother . <end>
<start> qui amotis stipatoribus , ut sagittarii nostra pro ripa dispositi abscederent postulat , et postquam digressi , unde ea deformitas oris interrogat fratrem . <end>$$<start> The permission was then given , and he stepped forth and was saluted by Arminius , who had removed his guards to a distance and required that the bowmen ranged on our bank should retire . <end>
<start> Flavus aucta stipendia , torquem et coronam aliaque militaria dona memorat , inridente Arminio vilia servitii pretia . <end>$$<start> Flavus spoke of increased pay , of a neck chain , a crown , and other military gifts , while Arminius jeered at such a paltry recompense for slavery . <end>
<start> neque coniugem et filium eius hostiliter haberi ille fas patriae , libertatem avitam , penetralis Germaniae deos , matrem precum sociam . <end>$$<start> The one spoke of the greatness of Rome , the resources of Caesar , the dreadful punishment in store for the vanquished , the ready mercy for him who surrenders , and the fact that neither Arminius's wife nor his son were treated as enemies . <end>
<start> paulatim inde ad iurgia prolapsi quo minus pugnam consererent ne flumine quidem interiecto cohibebantur , ni Stertinius adcurrens plenum irae armaque et equum poscentem Flavum attinuisset . <end>$$<start> By degrees they fell to bitter words , and even the river between them would not have hindered them from joining combat , had not Stertinius hurried up and put his hand on Flavus , who in the full tide of his fury was demanding his weapons and his charger . <end>
<start> cernebatur contra minitabundus Arminius proeliumque denuntians . <end>$$<start> Arminius was seen facing him , full of menaces and challenging him to conflict . <end>
<start> nam pleraque Latino sermone interiaciebat , ut qui Romanis in castris ductor popularium meruisset . <end>$$<start> Much of what he said was in Roman speech , for he had served in our camp as leader of his fellow-countrymen . <end>
<start> Postero die Germanorum acies trans Visurgim stetit . <end>$$<start> Next day the German army took up its position on the other side of the Visurgis . <end>
<start> Caesar nisi pontibus praesidiisque inpositis dare in discrimen legiones haud imperatorium ratus , equitem vado tramittit . <end>$$<start> It was commanded by Stertinius and Aemilius , one of the first rank centurions , who attacked at widely different points so as to distract the enemy . <end>
<start> praefuere Stertinius et e numero primipilarium Aemilius , distantibus locis invecti , ut hostem diducerent . <end>$$<start> Chariovalda , the Batavian chief , dashed to the charge where the stream is most rapid . <end>
<start> eum Cherusci fugam simulantes in planitiem saltibus circumiectam traxere dein coorti et undique effusi trudunt adversos , instant cedentibus collectosque in orbem pars congressi , quidam eminus proturbant . <end>$$<start> Chariovalda , after long sustaining the enemy's fury , cheered on his men to break by a dense formation the onset of their bands , while he himself , plunging into the thickest of the battle , fell amid a shower of darts with his horse pierced under him , and round him many noble chiefs . <end>
<start> convenisse et alias nationes in silvam Herculi sacram ausurosque nocturnam castrorum oppugnationem . <end>$$<start> Scouts also , who had crept close up to the enemy , reported that they had heard the neighing of horses and the hum of a huge and tumultuous host . <end>
<start> habita indici fides et cernebantur ignes , suggressique propius speculatores audiri fremitum equorum inmensique et inconditi agminis murmur attulere . <end>$$<start> And so as the decisive crisis drew near , that he ought thoroughly to sound the temper of his soldiers , he considered with himself how this was to be accomplished with a genuine result . <end>
<start> igitur propinquo summae rei discrimine explorandos militum animos ratus , quonam id modo incorruptum foret secum agitabat . <end>$$<start> Tribunes and centurions , he knew , oftener reported what was welcome than what was true . <end>
<start> si contio vocetur , illic quoque quae pauci incipiant reliquos adstrepere . <end>$$<start> If an assembly were called , there too the lead of a few was followed by the shout of the many . <end>
<start> penitus noscendas mentes , cum secreti et incustoditi inter militaris cibos spem aut metum proferrent . <end>$$<start> He must probe their inmost thoughts , when they were uttering their hopes and fears at the military mess , among themselves , and unwatched . <end>
<start> Nocte coepta egressus augurali per occulta et vigilibus ignara , comite uno , contectus umeros ferina pelle , adit castrorum vias , adsistit tabernaculis fruiturque fama sui , cum hic nobilitatem ducis , decorem alius , plurimi patientiam , comitatem , per seria per iocos eundem animum laudibus ferrent reddendamque gratiam in acie faterentur , simul perfidos et ruptores pacis ultioni et gloriae mactandos . <end>$$<start> At nightfall , leaving his tent of augury by a secret exit , unknown to the sentries , with one companion , his shoulders covered with a wild beast's skin , he visited the camp streets , stood by the tents , and enjoyed the men's talk about himself , as one extolled his noble rank , another , his handsome person , nearly all of them , his endurance , his gracious manner and the evenness of his temper , whether he was jesting or was serious , while they acknowledged that they ought to repay him with their gratitude in battle , and at the same time sacrifice to a glorious vengeance the perfidious violators of peace . <end>
<start> intendit ea contumelia legionum iras veniret dies , daretur pugna . <end>$$<start> Let daylight come , they said , let battle be given . <end>
<start> sumpturum militem Germanorum agros , tracturum coniuges . <end>$$<start> The soldiers will possess themselves of the lands of the Germans and will carry off their wives . <end>
<start> accipere omen et matrimonia ac pecunias hostium praedae destinare . <end>$$<start> We hail the omen we mean the women and riches of the enemy to be our spoil . <end>
<start> Nox eadem laetam Germanico quietem tulit , viditque se operatum et sanguine sacri respersa praetexta pulchriorem aliam manibus aviae Augustae accepisse . <end>$$<start> The same night brought with it a cheering dream to Germanicus He saw himself engaged in sacrifice , and his robe being sprinkled with the sacred blood , another more beautiful was given him by the hands of his grandmother Augusta . <end>
<start> auctus omine , addicentibus auspiciis , vocat contionem et quae sapientia provisa aptaque inminenti pugnae disserit . <end>$$<start> It is not , he said , plains only which are good for the fighting of Roman soldiers , but woods and forest passes , if science be used . <end>
<start> nec enim inmensa barbarorum scuta , enormis hastas inter truncos arborum et enata humo virgulta perinde haberi quam pila et gladios et haerentia corpori tegmina . <end>$$<start> If their first line is armed with spears , the rest have only weapons hardened by fire or very short Again , though their frames are terrible to the eye and formidable in a brief onset , they have no capacity of enduring wounds . <end>
<start> denserent ictus , ora mucronibus quaererent non loricam Germano , non galeam , ne scuta quidem ferro nervove firmata , sed viminum textus vel tenuis et fucatas colore tabulas . <end>$$<start> without , any shame at the disgrace , without any regard to their leaders , they quit the field and flee . <end>
<start> si taedio viarum ac maris finem cupiant , hac acie parari propiorem iam Albim quam Rhenum neque bellum ultra , modo se patris patruique vestigia prementem isdem in terris victorem sisterent . <end>$$<start> The Elbe is now nearer than the Rhine , and there is no war beyond , provided only you enable me , keeping close as I do to my father's and my uncle's footsteps , to stand a conqueror on the same spot . <end>
<start> Orationem ducis secutus militum ardor , signumque s pugnae datum . <end>$$<start> The general's speech was followed by enthusiasm in the soldiers , and the signal for battle was given . <end>
<start> nec Arminius aut ceteri Germanorum proceres omittebant suos quisque testari , hos esse Romanos Variani exercitus fugacissimos qui ne bellum tolerarent , seditionem induerint . <end>$$<start> Half of them have their backs covered with wounds half are once again exposing limbs battered by waves and storms to a foe full of fury , and to hostile deities , with no hope of advantage . <end>
<start> quorum pars onustavulneribus terga , pars fluctibus et procellis fractos artus infensis rursum hostibus , adversis dis obiciant , nulla boni spe . <end>$$<start> They have , in fact , had recourse to a fleet and to a trackless ocean , that their coming might be unopposed , their flight unpursued . <end>
<start> classem quippe et avia Oceani quaesita ne quis venientibus occurreret , ne pulsos premeret sed ubi miscuerint manus , inane victis ventumm remorumve subsidium . <end>$$<start> But when once they have joined conflict with us , the help of winds or oars will be unavailing to the vanquished . <end>
<start> meminissent modo avaritiae , crudelitatis , superbiae aliod sibi reliquum quam tenere libertatem aut mori ante servitium . <end>$$<start> Is anything left for us but to retain our freedom or to die before we are enslaved . <end>
<start> Sic accensos et proelium poscentis in campum , cui Idistaviso nomen , deducunt . <end>$$<start> When they were thus roused and were demanding battle , their chiefs led them down into a plain named Idistavisus . <end>
<start> is medius inter Visurgim et collis , ut ripae fluminis cedunt aut prominentia montium resistunt , inaequaliter sinuatur . <end>$$<start> It winds between the Visurgis and a hill range , its breadth varying as the river banks recede or the spurs of the hills project on it . <end>
<start> pone tergum insurgebat silva editis in altum ramis et pura humo inter arborum truncos . <end>$$<start> In their rear rose a forest , with the branches rising to a great height , while there were clear spaces between the trunks . <end>
<start> campum et prima silvarum barbara acies tenuit soli Cherusci iuga insedere ut proeliantibus Romanis desuper incurrerent . <end>$$<start> The barbarian army occupied the plain and the outskirts of the wood . <end>
<start> noster exercitus sic incessit auxiliares Galli Germanique in fronte , post quos pedites sagittatii . <end>$$<start> The Cherusci were posted by themselves on the high ground , so as to rush down on the Romans during the battle . <end>
<start> exim totidem aliae legiones et levis armatura cum equite sagittario ceteraeque sociorum cohortes . <end>$$<start> Next came as many other legions , and light-armed troops with horse-bowmen , and the remaining cohorts of the allies . <end>

<start> interea pulcherrimum augurium , octo aquilae petere silvas et intrare visae imperatorem advertere . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile there was a most encouraging augury Eight eagles , seen to fly towards the woods and to enter them , caught the general's eye . <end>

<start> Seio Tuberoni legato tradit equitem campumque . <end>$$<start> To Seius Tubero , his chief officer , he assigned the cavalry and the plain . <end>
<start> peditum aciem ita instruxit ut pars aequo in silvam aditu incederet , pars obiectum aggerem eniteretur . <end>$$<start> His infantry he drew up so that part might advance on level ground into the forest , and part clamber up the earthwork which confronted them . <end>
<start> quibus plana evenerant , facile inrupere quis inpugnandus agger , ut si murum succederent , gravibus superne ictibus conflictabantur . <end>$$<start> Spears were hurled from the engines , and the more conspicuous were the defenders of the position , the more the wounds with which they were driven from it . <end>
<start> sensit dux inparem comminus pugnam remotisque paulum legionibus funditores libritoresque excutere tela et proturbare hostem iubet . <end>$$<start> Caesar with some praetorian cohorts was the first , after the storming of the ramparts , to dash into the woods . <end>
<start> primus Caesar cum praetoriis cohortibus capto vallo dedit impetum in silvas . <end>$$<start> A morass was in the enemy's rear , and the Romans were hemmed in by the river or by the hills . <end>
<start> conlato illic gradu certatum . <end>$$<start> Both were in a desperate plight from their position . <end>
<start> Nec minor Germanis animus , sed genere pugnae et armorum superabantur , cum ingens multitudo artis locis praelongas hastas non protenderet , non colligeret , neque adsultibus et velocitate corporum uteretur , coacta stabile ad proelium . <end>$$<start> The Germans were equally brave , but they were beaten by the nature of the fighting and of the weapons , for their vast host in so confined a space could neither thrust out nor recover their immense lances , or avail themselves of their nimble movements and lithe frames , forced as they were to a close engagement . <end>
<start> contra miles , cui scutum pecotri adpressum et insidens capulo manus , latos barbarorum artus , nuda ora foderet viamque strage hostium aperiret , inprompto iam Arminio ob continua pericula , sive illum recens acceptum vulnus tardaverat . <end>$$<start> Our soldiers , on the other hand , with their shields pressed to their breasts , and their hands grasping their sword-hilts , struck at the huge limbs and exposed faces of the barbarians , cutting a passage through the slaughtered enemy , for Arminius was now less active , either from incessant perils , or because he was partially disabled by his recent wound . <end>
<start> quin et Inguiomerum , tota volitantem acie , fortuna magis quam virtus deserebat . <end>$$<start> As for Inguiomerus , who flew hither and thither over the battlefield , it was fortune rather than courage which forsook him . <end>
<start> et Germanicus quo magis adgnosceretur detraxerat tegimen capitii orabatque insisterent caedibus nil opus captivis , solam internicionem gentis finem bello fore . <end>$$<start> Germanicus , too , that he might be the better known , took his helmet off his head and begged his men to follow up the slaughter , as they wanted not prisoners , and the utter destruction of the nation would be the only conclusion of the war . <end>
<start> iamque sero diei subducit ex acie legionem faciendis castris ceterae ad noctem cruore hostium satiatae sunt . <end>$$<start> And now , late in the day , he withdrew one of his legions from the field , to intrench a camp , while the rest till nightfall glutted themselves with the enemy's blood . <end>
<start> equites ambigue certavere . <end>$$<start> Our cavalry fought with indecisive success . <end>
<start> Laudatis pro contione victoribus Caesar congeriem armorum struxit , superbo cum titulo debellatis inter Rhenum Albimque nationibus exercitum Tiberii Caesaris ea monimenta Marti et Iovi et Augusto sacravisse . <end>$$<start> Having publicly praised his victorious troops , Caesar raised a pile of arms with the proud inscription , The army of Tiberius Caesar , after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the Rhine and the Elbe , has dedicated this monument to Mars , Jupiter , and Augustus . <end>
<start> de se nihil addidit , metu invidiae an ratus conscientiam facti satis esse . <end>$$<start> He added nothing about himself , fearing jealousy , or thinking that the conciousness of the achievement was enough . <end>
<start> mox bellum in Angrivarios Stertinio mandat , ni deditionem properavissent . <end>$$<start> Next he charged Stertinius with making war on the Angrivarii , but they hastened to surrender . <end>
<start> atque illi supplices nihil abnuendo veniam omnium accepere . <end>$$<start> And , as suppliants , by refusing nothing , they obtained a full pardon . <end>
<start> milesque pavidus et casuum maris ignarus dum turbat nautas vel intempestive iuvat , officia prudentium corrumpebat omne dehinc caelum et mare omne in austrum cessit , qui tumidis Germaniae terris , profundis amnibus , immenso nubium tractu validus et rigore vicini septentrionis horridior rapuit disiecitque navis in aperta Oceani aut insulas saxis abruptis vel per occulta vada infestas . <end>$$<start> these they just escaped , with difficulty , and when the tide changed and bore them the same way as the wind , they could not hold to their anchors or bale out the water which rushed in upon them . <end>
<start> quibus paulum aegreque vitatis , postquam mutabat aestus eodemque quo ventus ferebat , non adhaerere ancoris , non exhaurire inrumpentis undas poterant equi , iumenta , sarcinae , etiam arma praecipitantur quo levarentur alvei manantes per latera et fluctu superurgente . <end>$$<start> Horses , beasts of burden , baggage , were thrown overboard , in order to lighten the hulls which leaked copiously through their sides , while the waves too dashed over them . <end>
<start> Quanto violentior cetero mari Oceanus et truculentia caeli praestat Germania , tantum illa clades novitate et magnitudine excessit , hostilibus circum litoribus aut ita vasto et profundo ut credatur novissimum ac sine terris mare . <end>$$<start> As the ocean is stormier than all other seas , and as Germany is conspicuous for the terrors of its climate , so in novelty and extent did this disaster transcend every other , for all around were hostile coasts , or an expanse so vast and deep that it is thought to be the remotest shoreless sea . <end>
<start> pars navium haustae sunt , plures apud insulas longius sitas eiectae . <end>$$<start> Some of the vessels were swallowed up . <end>
<start> milesque nullo illic hominum cultu fame absumptus , nisi quos corpora equorum eodem elisa toleraverant . <end>$$<start> many were wrecked on distant islands , and the soldiers , finding there no form of human life , perished of hunger , except some who supported existence on carcases of horses washed on the same shores . <end>
<start> sola Germanici triremis Chaucorum terram adpulit . <end>$$<start> Germanicus's trireme alone reached the country of the Chauci . <end>
<start> quem per omnis illos dies noctesque apud scopulos et prominentis oras , cum se tanti exitii reum clamitaret , vix cohibuere amici quo minus eodem mari oppeteret . <end>$$<start> Day and night , on those rocks and promontories he would incessantly exclaim that he was himself responsible for this awful ruin , and friends scarce restrained him from seeking death in the same sea . <end>
<start> tandem relabente aestu et secundante vento claudae naves raro remigio aut intentis vestibus , et quaedam a validioribus tractae , revertere . <end>$$<start> At last , as the tide ebbed and the wind blew favourably , the shattered vessels with but few rowers , or clothing spread as sails , some towed by the more powerful , returned , and Germanicus , having speedily repaired them , sent them to search the islands . <end>
<start> quas raptim refectas misit ut scrutarentur insulas . <end>$$<start> Many by that means were recovered . <end>
<start> collecti ea cura plerique multos Angrivarii nuper in fidem accepti redemptos ab interioribus reddidere . <end>$$<start> The Angrivarii , who had lately been admitted to our alliance , restored to us several had ransomed from the inland tribes . <end>
<start> quidam in Britanniam rapti et remissi a regulis . <end>$$<start> Some had been carried to Britain and were sent back by the petty chiefs . <end>
<start> ut quis ex longinquo revenerat , miracula narrabant , vim turbinum et inauditas volucris , monstra maris , ambiguas hominum et beluarum formas , visa sive ex metu credita . <end>$$<start> Every one , as he returned from some far-distant region , told of wonders , of violent hurricanes , and unknown birds , of monsters of the sea , of forms half-human , half beast-like , things they had really seen or in their terror believed . <end>
<start> Sed fama classis amissae ut Germanos ad spem belli , ita Caesarem ad coercendum erexit . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile the rumoured loss of the fleet stirred the Germans to hope for war , as it did Caesar to hold them down . <end>
<start> Gaius Silio cum triginta peditum , tribus equitum milibus ire in Chattos imperat . <end>$$<start> He ordered Caius Silius with thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry to march against the Chatti . <end>
<start> ipse maioribus copiis Marsos inrumpit , quorum dux Mallovendus nuper in deditionem acceptus propinquo luco defossam Varianae legionis aquilam modico praesidio servari indicat . <end>$$<start> He himself , with a larger army , invaded the Marsi , whose leader , Mallovendus , whom we had lately admitted to surrender , pointed out a neighbouring wood , where , he said , an eagle of one of Varus's legions was buried and guarded only by a small force . <end>
<start> missa extemplo manus quae hostem a fronte eliceret , alii qui terga circumgressi recluderent humum . <end>$$<start> Immediately troops were despatched to draw the enemy from his position by appearing in his front , others , to hem in his rear and open the ground . <end>
<start> et utrisque adfuit fortuna . <end>$$<start> Fortune favoured both . <end>
<start> eo promptior Caesar pergit introrsus , populatur , excindit non ausum congredi hostem aut , sicubi restiterat , statim pulsum nec umquam magis , ut ex captivis cognitum est , paventem . <end>$$<start> So Germanicus , with increased energy , advanced into the country , laying it waste , and utterly ruining a foe who dared not encounter him , or who was instantly defeated wherever he resisted , and , as we learnt from prisoners , was never more panic-stricken . <end>
<start> quippe invictos et nullis casibas superabilis Romanos praedicabant , qui perdita classe , amissis armis , post constrata equorum virorumque corporibus litora eadem virtute , pari ferocia et velut aucti numero inrupissent . <end>$$<start> The Romans , they declared , were invincible , rising superior to all calamities for having thrown away a fleet , having lost their arms , after strewing the shores with the carcases of horses and of men , they had rushed to the attack with the same courage , with equal spirit , and , seemingly , with augmented numbers . <end>
<start> Reductus inde in hiberna miles , laetus animi quod adversa marls expeditione prospera pensavisset . <end>$$<start> The soldiers were then led back into winter-quarters , rejoicing in their hearts at having been compensated for their disasters at sea by a successful expedition . <end>
<start> addidit munificentiam Caesar , quantum quis damni professus erat exsolvendo . <end>$$<start> They were helped too by Caesar's bounty , which made good whatever loss any one declared he had suffered . <end>
<start> nec dubium habebatur labare hostis petendaeque pacis consilia sumere , et si proxima aestas adiceretur , posse bellum patrari . <end>$$<start> It was also regarded as a certainty that the enemy were wavering and consulting on negotiations for peace , and that , with an additional campaign next summer the war might be ended . <end>
<start> sed crebris epistulis Tiberius monebat rediret ad decretum triumphum satis iam eventuum , satis casuum . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , however , in repeated letters advised Germanicus to return for the triumph decreed him . <end>
<start> prospera illi et magna proelia eorum quoque meminisset , quae venti et fluctus , nulla ducis culpa , gravia tamen et saeva damna intulissent . <end>$$<start> He had now had enough of success , enough of disaster He had fought victorious battles on a great scale . <end>
<start> sic Sugambros in deditionem acceptos , sic Suebos regemque Maroboduum pace obstrictum . <end>$$<start> By this means the submission of the Sugambri had been secured , and the Suevi with their king Maroboduus had been forced into peace . <end>
<start> posse et Cheruscos ceterasque rebellium gentis , quoniam Romanae ultioni consultum esset , internis discordiis relinqui . <end>$$<start> The Cherusci too and the other insurgent tribes , since the vengeance of Rome had been satisfied , might be left to their internal feuds . <end>
<start> precante Germanico annum efficiendis coeptis , acrius modestiam eius adgreditur alterum consulatum offerendo cuius munia praesens obiret . <end>$$<start> When Germanicus requested a year for the completion of his enterprise , Tiberius put a severer pressure on his modesty by offering him a second consulship , the functions of which he was to discharge in person . <end>
<start> simul adnectebat , si foret adhuc bellandum , relinqueret materiem Drusi fratris gloriae , qui nullo tum alio hoste non nisi apud Germanias adsequi nomen imperatorium et deportare lauream posset . <end>$$<start> He also added that if war must still be waged , he might as well leave some materials for renown to his brother Drusus , who , as there was then no other enemy , could win only in Germany the imperial title and the triumphal laurel . <end>
<start> haud cunctatus est ultra Germanicus , quamquam fingi ea seque per invidiam parto iam decori abstrahi intellegeret . <end>$$<start> Germanicus hesitated no longer , though he saw that this was a pretence , and that he was hurried away through jealousy from the glory he had already acquired . <end>
<start> Sub idem tempus e familia Scriboniorum Libo Drusus defertur moliri res novas . <end>$$<start> About the same time Libo Drusus , of the family of Scribonii , was accused of revolutionary schemes . <end>
<start> eius negotii initium , ordinem , finem curatius disseram , quia tum primum reperta sunt quae per tot annos rem publicam exedere . <end>$$<start> I will explain , somewhat minutely , the beginning , progress , and end of this affair , since then first were originated those practices which for so many years have eaten into the heart of the State . <end>
<start> Firmius Catus senator , ex intima Libonis amicitia , invenem inprovidum et facilem inanibus ad Chaldaeorum promissa , magorum sacra , somniorum etiam interpretes impulit , dum proavom Pompeium , amitam Scriboniam , quae quondam Augusti coniunx fuerat , consobrinos Caesares , plenam imaginibus domum ostentat , hortaturque ad luxum et aes alienum , socius libidinum et necessitatum , quo pluribus indiciis inligaret . <end>$$<start> Firmius Catus , a senator , an intimate friend of Libo's , prompted the young man , who was thoughtless and an easy prey to delusions , to resort to astrologers' promises , magical rites , and interpreters of dreams , dwelling ostentatiously on his great-grandfather Pompeius , his aunt Scribonia , who had formerly been wife of Augustus , his imperial cousins , his house crowded with ancestral busts , and urging him to extravagance and debt , himself the companion of his profligacy and desperate embarrassments , thereby to entangle him in all the more proofs of guilt . <end>
<start> Vt satis testium et qui servi eadem noscerent repperit , aditum ad principem postulat , demonstrato crimine et reo per Flaccum Vescularium equitem Romanum , cui propior cum Tiberio usus erat . <end>$$<start> As soon as he found enough witnesses , with some slaves who knew the facts , he begged an audience of the emperor , after first indicating the crime and the criminal through Flaccus Vescularius , a Roman knight , who was more intimate with Tiberius than himself . <end>
<start> Caesar indicium haud aspernatus congressus abnuit posse enim eodem Flacco internuntio sermones commeare . <end>$$<start> Caesar , without disregarding the information , declined an interview , for the communication , he said , might be conveyed to him through the same messenger , Flaccus . <end>
<start> atque interim Libonem ornat praetura , convictibus adhibet , non vultu alienatus , non verbis commotior (adeo iram condiderat) . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile he conferred the praetorship on Libo and often invited him to his table , showing no unfriendliness in his looks or anger in his words (so thoroughly had he concealed his resentment) . <end>
<start> cunctaque eius dicta factaque , cum prohibere posset , scire malebat , donec Iunius quidam , temptatus ut infernas umbras carminibus eliceret , ad Fulcinium Trionem indicium detulit . <end>$$<start> and he wished to know all his saying and doings , though it was in his power to stop them , till one Junius , who had been tampered with by Libo for the purpose of evoking by incantations spirits of the dead , gave information to Fulcinius Trio . <end>
<start> celebre inter accusatores Trionis ingenium erat avidumque famae malae . <end>$$<start> Trio's ability was conspicuous among informers , as well as his eagerness for an evil notoriety . <end>
<start> statim corripit reum , adit consules , cognitionem senatus poscit . <end>$$<start> He at once pounced on the accused , went to the consuls , and demanded an inquiry before the Senate . <end>
<start> et vocantur patres , addito consultandum super re magna et atroci . <end>$$<start> The Senators were summoned , with a special notice that they must consult on a momentous and terrible matter . <end>
<start> Libo interim veste mutata cum primoribus feminis circumire domos , orare adfinis , vocem adversum pericula poscere , abouentibus cunctis , cum diversa praetenderent , eadem formidine . <end>$$<start> Libo meanwhile , in mourning apparel and accompanied by ladies of the highest rank , went to house after house , entreating his relatives , and imploring some eloquent voice to ward off his perils . <end>
<start> die senatus metu et aegritudine fessus , sive , ut tradidere quidam , simulato morbo , lectica delatus ad foris curiae innisusque fratri et manus ac supplices voces ad Tiberium tendens immoto eius vultu excipitur . <end>$$<start> which all refused , on different pretexts , but from the same apprehension On the day the Senate met , jaded with fear and mental anguish , or , as some have related , feigning illness , he was carried in a litter to the doors of the Senate House , and leaning on his brother he raised his hands and voice in supplication to Tiberius , who received him with unmoved countenance . <end>
<start> mox libellos et auctores recitat Caesar ita moderans ne lenire neve asperare crimina videretur . <end>$$<start> The emperor then read out the charges and the accusers' names , with such calmness as not to seem to soften or aggravate the accusations . <end>
<start> Accesserant praeter Trionem et Catum accusatores Fonteius Agrippa et Gaius Vibius , certabantque cui ius perorandi in reum daretur , donec Vibius , quia nec ipsi inter se concederent et Libo sine patrono introisset , singillatim se crimina obiecturum professus , protulit libellos vaecordes adeo ut consultaverit Libo an habiturus foret opes quis viam Appiam Brundisium usque pecunia operiret . <end>$$<start> Besides Trio and Catus , Fonteius Agrippa and Caius Vibius were among his accusers , and claimed with eager rivalry the privilege of conducting the case for the prosecution , till Vibius , as they would not yield one to the other , and Libo had entered without counsel , offered to state the charges against him singly , and produced an extravagantly absurd accusation , according to which Libo had consulted persons whether he would have such wealth as to be able to cover the Appian road as far as Brundisium with money . <end>
<start> inerant et alia huiusce modi stolida vana , si mollius acciperes , misemuda . <end>$$<start> There were other questions of the same sort , quite senseless and idle . <end>
<start> uni tamen libello manu Libonis nominibus Caesarum aut senatorum additas atrocis vel occultas notas accusator arguebat . <end>$$<start> if leniently regarded , pitiable But there was one paper in Libo's handwriting , so the prosecutor alleged , with the names of Caesars and of Senators , to which marks were affixed of dreadful or mysterious significance . <end>
<start> negante reo adgnoscentis servos per tormenta interrogari placuit . <end>$$<start> When the accused denied this , it was decided that his slaves who recognised the writing should be examined by torture . <end>
<start> et quia vetere senatus consulto quaestio in caput domini prohibebatur , callidus et novi iuris repertor Tiberius mancipari singulos actori publico iubet , scilicet ut in Libonem ex servis salvo senatus consulto quaereretur . <end>$$<start> As an ancient statute of the Senate forbade such inquiry in a case affecting a master's life , Tiberius , with his cleverness in devising new law , ordered Libo's slaves to be sold singly to the State-agent , so that , forsooth , without an infringement of the Senate's decree , Libo might be tried on their evidence . <end>
<start> ob quae posterum diem reus petivit domumque digressus extremas preces Publius Quirinio propinquo suo ad principem mandavit . <end>$$<start> As a consequence , the defendant asked an adjournment till next day , and having gone home he charged his kinsman , Publius Quirinus , with his last prayer to the emperor . <end>
<start> Responsum est ut senatum rogaret . <end>$$<start> The answer was that he should address himself to the Senate . <end>
<start> cingebatur interim milite domus , strepebant etiam in vestibulo ut audiri , ut aspici possent , cum Libo ipsis quas in novissimam voluptatem adhibuerat epulis excruciatus vocare percussorem , prensare servorum dextras , inserere gladium . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile his house was surrounded with soldiers they crowded noisily even about the entrance , so that they could be heard and seen . <end>
<start> atque illis , dum trepidant , dum refugiunt , evertentibus adpositum cum mensa lumen , feralibus iam sibi tenebris duos ictus in viscera derexit . <end>$$<start> when Libo , whose anguish drove him from the very banquet he had prepared as his last gratification , called for a minister of death , grasped the hands of his slaves , and thrust a sword into them . <end>
<start> accusatio tamen apud patres adseveratione eadem peracta , iuravitque Tiberius petiturum se vitam quamvis nocenti , nisi voluntariam mortem properavisset . <end>$$<start> Yet the prosecution was continued in the Senate with the same persistency , and Tiberius declared on oath that he would have interceded for his life , guilty though he was , but for his hasty suicide . <end>
<start> Bona inter accusatores dividuntur , et praeturae extra ordinem datae iis qui senatorii ordinis erant . <end>$$<start> His property was divided among his accusers , and praetorships out of the usual order were conferred on those who were of senators' rank . <end>
<start> tunc Cotta Messalinus , ne imago Libonis exequias posterorum comitaretur , censuit , Gnaeus Lentulus , ne quis Scribonius cognomentum Drusi adsumeret . <end>$$<start> Cotta Messalinus then proposed that Libo's bust should not be carried in the funeral procession of any of his descendants . <end>
<start> supplicationum dies Pomponii Flacci sententia constituti , dona Iovi , Marti , Concordiae , utque idumn Septembrium dies , quo se Libo interfecerat , dies festus haberetur , Lucius Piso et Gallus Asinius et Papius Mutilus et Lucius Apronius decrevere . <end>$$<start> and Cneius Lentulus , that no Scribonius should assume the surname of Drusus Days of public thanksgiving were appointed on the suggestion of Pomponius Flaccus . <end>
<start> facta et de mathematicis magisque Italia pellendis senatus consulta . <end>$$<start> One of their number , Lucius Pituanius , was hurled from the Rock . <end>
<start> quorum e numero Lucius Pituanius saxo deiectus est , in Publius Marcium consules extra portam Esquilinam , cum classicum canere iussissent , more prisco advertere . <end>$$<start> Another , Publius Marcius , was executed , according to ancient custom , by the consuls outside the Esquiline Gate , after the trumpets had been bidden to sound . <end>
<start> atus die multa in luxum civitatis dicta a Quintus Haterio consulari , Octavio Frontone praetura functo . <end>$$<start> With the growth of the empire private wealth too , he said , had increased , and there was nothing new in this , but it accorded with the fashions of the earliest antiquity . <end>
<start> decretumque ne vasa auro solida ministrandis cibis fierent , ne vestis serica viros foedaret . <end>$$<start> Riches were one thing with the Fabricii , quite another with the Scipios . <end>
<start> et cuncta ad rem publicam referri , qua tenui angustas civium domos , postquam eo magnificentiae venerit , gliscere singulos . <end>$$<start> when it reached such magnificence , private grandeur increased . <end>
<start> neque in familia et argento quaeque ad usum parentur nimium aliquid aut modicum nisi ex fortuna possidentis . <end>$$<start> In household establishments , and plate , and in whatever was provided for use , there was neither excess nor parsimony except in relation to the fortune of the possessor . <end>
<start> distinctos senatus et equitum census , non quia diversi natura , sed ut locis ordinibus dignationibus antistent , ita iis quae ad requiem animi aut salubritatem corporum parentur , nisi forte clarissimo cuique pluris curas , maiora pericula subeunda , delenimentis curarum et periculorum carendum esse . <end>$$<start> A distinction had been made in the assessments of Senators and knights , not because they differed naturally , but that the superiority of the one class in places in the theatre , in rank and in honour , might be also maintained in everything else which insured mental repose and bodily recreation , unless indeed men in the highest position were to undergo more anxieties and more dangers , and to be at the same time deprived of all solace under those anxieties and dangers . <end>
<start> facilem adsensum Gallo sub nominibus honestis confessio vitiorum et similitudo audientium dedit . <end>$$<start> Gallus gained a ready assent , under these specious phrases , by a confession of failings with which his audience symphathised . <end>
<start> adiecerat et Tiberius non id tempus censurae nec , si quid in moribus labaret , defuturum corrigendi auctorem . <end>$$<start> And Tiberius too had added that this was not a time for censorship , and that if there were any declension in manners , a promoter of reform would not be wanting . <end>
<start> Inter quae Lucius Piso ambitum fori , corrupta iudicia , saevitiam oratorum accusationes minitantium increpans , abire se et cedere urbe , victurum in aliquo abdito et longinquo rure testabatur . <end>$$<start> During this debate Lucius Piso , after exclaiming against the corruption of the courts , the bribery of judges , the cruel threats of accusations from hired orators , declared that he would depart and quit the capital , and that he meant to live in some obscure and distant rural retreat . <end>
<start> commotus est Tiberius , et quamquam mitibus verbis Pisonem permulsisset , propinquos quoque eius impulit ut abeuntem auctoritate vel precibus tenerent . <end>$$<start> Neither did Urgulania obey the summons , for in defiance of Piso she went in her litter to the emperor's house . <end>
<start> haud minus liberi doloris documentum idem Piso mox dedit vocata in ius Vrgulania , quam supra leges amicitia Augustae extulerat . <end>$$<start> nor did Piso give way , though Augusta complained that she was insulted and her majesty slighted . <end>
<start> nec aut Vrgulania optemperavit , in domum Caesaris spreto Pisone vecta , aut ille abscessit , quamquam Augusta se violari et imminui quereretur . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , to win popularity by so humouring his mother as to say that he would go to the praetor's court and support Urgulania , went forth from the palace , having ordered soldiers to follow him at a distance . <end>
<start> Tiberius hactenus indulgere matri civile ratus , ut se iturum ad praetoris tribunal , adfuturum Vrgulaniae diceret , processit Palatio , procul sequi iussis militibus . <end>$$<start> He was seen , as the people thronged about him , to wear a calm face , while he prolonged his time on the way with various conversations , till at last when Piso's relatives tried in vain to restrain him , Augusta directed the money which was claimed to be handed to him . <end>
<start> spectabatur occursante populo compositus ore et sermonibus variis tempus atque iter ducens , donec propinquis Pisonem frustra coercentibus deferri Augusta pecuniam quae petebatur iuberet . <end>$$<start> This ended the affair , and Piso , in consequence , was not dishonoured , and the emperor rose in reputation . <end>
<start> ceterum Vrgulaniae potentia adeo nimia civitati erat ut testis in causa quadam , quae apud senatum tractabatur , venire dedignaretur missus est praetor qui domi interrogaret , cum virgines Vestales in foro et iudicio audiri , quotiens testimonium dicerent , vetus mos fuerit . <end>$$<start> The praetor was sent to question her at her own house , although the Vestal virgins , according to ancient custom , were heard in the courts , before judges , whenever they gave evidence . <end>
<start> Res eo anno prolatas haud referrem , ni pretium foret Gnaeus Pisonis et Asinii Galli super eo negotio diversas sententias noscere . <end>$$<start> I should say nothing of the adjournment of public business in this year , if it were not worth while to notice the conflicting opinions of Cneius Piso and Asinius Gallus on the subject . <end>
<start> Et certamen Gallo adversus Caesarem exortum est . <end>$$<start> A dispute then arose between Gallus and the emperor . <end>
<start> nam censuit in quinquennium magistratuum comitia habenda , utque legionum legati , qui ante praeturam ea militia fungebantur , iam tum praetores destinarentur , princeps duodecim candidatos in annos singulos nominaret . <end>$$<start> Gallus proposed that the elections of magistrates should be held every five years , and that the commanders of the legions who before receiving a praetorship discharged this military service should at once become praetorselect , the emperor nominating twelve candidates every year . <end>
<start> haud dubium erat eam sententiam altius penetrare et arcana imperii temptari . <end>$$<start> It was quite evident that this motion had a deeper meaning and was an attempt to explore the secrets of imperial policy . <end>
<start> Tiberius tamen , quasi augeretur potestas eius , disseruit grave moderationi suae tot eligere , tot differre . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , however , argued as if his power would be thus increased . <end>
<start> vix per singulos annos offensiones vitari , quamvis repulsam propinqua spes soletur quantum odii fore ab iis qui ultra quinquennium proiciantur . <end>$$<start> It would , he said , be trying to his moderation to have to elect so many and to put off so many . <end>
<start> unde prospici posse quae cuique tam longo temporis spatio mens , domus , fortuna . <end>$$<start> He scarcely avoided giving offence from year to year , even though a candidate's rejection was solaced by the near prospect of office . <end>
<start> quinquiplicari prorsus magistratus , subverti leges , quae sua spatia exercendae candidatorum industriae quaerendisque aut potiundis honoribus statuerint . <end>$$<start> It was in fact a multiplying of the magistrates five-fold , and a subversion of the laws which had prescribed proper periods for the exercise of the candidate's activity and the seeking or securing office . <end>
<start> favorabili in speciem oratione vim imperii tenuit . <end>$$<start> With this seemingly conciliatory speech he retained the substance of power . <end>
<start> Censusque quorundam senatorum iuvit . <end>$$<start> He also increased the incomes of some of the Senators . <end>
<start> en stirps et progenies tot consulum , tot dictatorum . <end>$$<start> Not to excite odium do I recall such facts , but to win compassion . <end>
<start> nec ad invidiam ista sed conciliandae misericordiae refero . <end>$$<start> While you prosper , Caesar , they will attain such promotion as you shall bestow . <end>
<start> Inclinatio senatus incitamentum Tiberio fuit quo promptius adversaretur , his ferme verbis usus si quantum pauperum est venire huc et liberis suis petere pecunias coeperint , singuli numquam exsatiabuntur , res publica deficiet . <end>$$<start> The Senate's favourable bias was an incitement to Tiberius to offer prompt opposition , which he did in nearly these words : - If all poor men begin to come here and to beg money for their children , individuals will never be satisfied , and the State will be bankrupt . <end>
<start> nec sane ideo a maioribus concessum est egredi aliquando relationem et quod in commune conducat loco sententiae proferre , ut privata negotia et res familiaris nostras hic augeamus , cum invidia senatus et principum , sive indulserint largitionem sive abnuerint . <end>$$<start> Certainly our ancestors did not grant the privilege of occasionally proposing amendments or of suggesting , in our turn for speaking , something for the general advantage in order that we might in this house increase our private business and property , thereby bringing odium on the Senate and on emperors whether they concede or refuse their bounty . <end>
<start> non enim preces sunt istud , sed efflagitatio , intempestiva quidem et inprovisa , cum aliis de rebus convenerint patres , consurgere et numero atque aetate liberum suorum urgere modestiam senatus , eandem vim in me transmittere ac velut perfringere aerarium , quod si ambitione exhauserimus , per scelera supplendum erit . <end>$$<start> In fact , it is not a request , but an importunity , as utterly unreasonable as it is unforeseen , for a senator , when the house has met on other matters , to rise from his place and , pleading the number and age of his children , put a pressure on the delicacy of the Senate , then transfer the same constraint to myself , and , as it were , break open the exchequer , which , if we exhaust it by improper favouritism , will have to be replenished by crimes . <end>
<start> dedit tibi , Hortale , divus Augustus pecuniam , sed non conpellatus nec en lege ut semper daretur . <end>$$<start> Money was given you , Hortalus , by Augustus , but without solicitation , and not on the condition of its being always given . <end>
<start> languescet alioqui industria , intendetur socordia , si nullus ex se metus aut spes , et securi omnes aliena subsidia expectabunt , sibi ignavi , nobis graves . <end>$$<start> Otherwise industry will languish and idleness be encouraged , if a man has nothing to fear , nothing to hope from himself , and every one , in utter recklessness , will expect relief from others , thus becoming useless to himself and a burden to me . <end>
<start> haec atque talia , quamquam cum adsensu audita ab iis quibus omnia principum , honesta atque inhonesta , laudare mos est , plures per silentium aut occultum murmur excepere . <end>$$<start> These and like remarks , though listened to with assent by those who make it a practice to eulogise everything coming from sovereigns , both good and bad , were received by the majority in silence or with suppressed murmurs . <end>
<start> egere alii grates siluit Hortalus , pavore an avitae nobilitatis etiam inter angustias fortunae retinens . <end>$$<start> Hortalus said nothing , either from alarm or because even in his reduced fortunes he clung to his hereditary nobility . <end>
<start> neque miseratus est posthac Tiberius , quamvis domus Hortensii pudendam ad inopiam delaberetur . <end>$$<start> Nor did Tiberius afterwards show any pity , though the house of Hortensius sank into shameful poverty . <end>
<start> Eodem anno mancipii unius audacia , ni mature subventum foret , discordiis armisque civilibus rem publicam perculisset . <end>$$<start> That same year the daring of a single slave , had it not been promptly checked , would have ruined the State by discord and civil war . <end>
<start> Postumi Agrippae servus , nomine Clemens , comperto fine Augusti pergere in insulam Planasiam et fraude aut vi raptum Agrippam ferre ad exercitus Germanicos non servili animo concepit . <end>$$<start> A servant of Postumus Agrippa , Clemens by name , having ascertained that Augustus was dead , formed a design beyond a slave's conception , of going to the island of Planasia and seizing Agrippa by craft or force and bringing him to the armies of Germany . <end>
<start> ausa eius inpedivit tarditas onerariae navis atque interim patrata caede ad maiora et magis praecipitia conversus furatur cineres vectusque Cosam Etruriae promunturium ignotis locis sese abdit , donec crinem barbamque promitteret nam aetate et forma haud dissimili in dominum erat . <end>$$<start> The slowness of a merchant vessel thwarted his bold venture Meanwhile the murder of Agrippa had been perpetrated , and then turning his thoughts to a greater and more hazardous enterprise , he stole the ashes of the deceased , sailed to Cosa , a promontory of Etruria , and there hid himself in obscure places till his hair and beard were long . <end>
<start> tum per idoneos et secreti eius socios crebrescit vivere Agrippam , occultis primum sermonibus , ut vetita solent , mox vago rumore apud inperitissimi cuiusque promptas auris aut rursum apud turbidos eoque nova cupientis . <end>$$<start> In age and figure he was not unlike his master Then through suitable emissaries who shared his secret , it was rumoured that Agrippa was alive , first in whispered gossip , soon , as is usual with forbidden topics , in vague talk which found its way to the credulous ears of the most ignorant people or of restless and revolutionary schemers . <end>
<start> atque ipse adire municipia obscuro diei , neque propalam aspici neque diutius isdem locis , sed quia veritas visu et mora , falsa festinatione et incertis valescunt , relinquebat famam aut praeveniebat . <end>$$<start> He himself went to the towns , as the day grew dark , without letting himself be seen publicly or remaining long in the same places , but , as he knew that truth gains strength by notoriety and time , falsehood by precipitancy and vagueness , he would either withdraw himself from publicity or else forestall it . <end>
<start> Vulgabatur interim per Italiam servatum munere deum Agrippam , credebatur Romae . <end>$$<start> It was rumoured meanwhile throughout Italy , and was believed at Rome , that Agrippa had been saved by the blessing of Heaven . <end>
<start> iamque Ostiam invectum multitudo ingens , iam in urbe clandestini coetus celebrabant , cum Tiberium anceps cura distrahere , vine militum servum suum coerceret an inanem credulitatem tempore ipso vanescere sineret modo nihil spernendum , modo non omnia metuenda ambiguus pudoris ac metus reputabat . <end>$$<start> Already at Ostia , where he had arrived , he was the centre of interest to a vast concourse as well as to secret gatherings in the capital , while Tiberius was distracted by the doubt whether he should crush this slave of his by military force or allow time to dissipate a silly credulity . <end>
<start> ille e clientibus duos (quidam milites fuisse tradunt) deligit atque hortatur , simulata conscientia adeant , offerant pecuniam , fidem atque pericula polliceantur . <end>$$<start> At last he entrusted the affair to Sallustius Crispus , who chose two of his dependants (some say they were soldiers) and urged them to go to him as pretended accomplices , offering money and promising faithful companionship in danger . <end>
<start> exequuntur ut iussum erat . <end>$$<start> They did as they were bidden . <end>
<start> dein speculati noctem incustoditam , accepta idonea manu , vinctum clauso ore in Palatium traxere . <end>$$<start> then , waiting for an unguarded hour of night , they took with them a sufficient force , and having bound and gagged him , dragged him to the palace . <end>
<start> percontanti Tiberio quo modo Agrippa factus esset respondisse fertur quo modo tu Caesar . <end>$$<start> When Tiberius asked him how he had become Agrippa , he is said to have replied , As you became Caesar . <end>
<start> ut ederet socios subigi non potuit . <end>$$<start> He could not be forced to divulge his accomplices . <end>
<start> nec Tiberius poenam eius palam ausus , in secreta Palatii parte interfici iussit corpusque clam auferri . <end>$$<start> Tiberius did not venture on a public execution , but ordered him to be slain in a private part of the palace and his body to be secretly removed . <end>
<start> et quamquam multi e domo principis equitesque ac senatores sustentasse opibus , iuvisse consiliis dicerentur , haud quaesitum . <end>$$<start> And although many of the emperor's household and knights and senators were said to have supported him with their wealth and helped him with their counsels , no inquiry was made . <end>
<start> Fine anni arcus propter aedem Saturni ob recepta signa cum Varo amissa ductu Germanici , auspiciis Tiberii , et aedes Fortis Fortunae Tiberim iuxta in hortis , quos Caesar dictator populo Romano legaverat , sacrarium genti Iuliae effigiesque divo Augusto apud Bovillas dicantur . <end>$$<start> At the close of the year was consecrated an arch near the temple of Saturn to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost with Varus , under the leadership of Germanicus and the auspices of Tiberius . <end>
<start> Gaius Caelio Lucius Pomponio consulibus Germanicus Caesar ante diem VII . <end>$$<start> a temple of Fors Fortuna , by the Tiber , in the gardens which Caesar , the dictator , bequeathed to the Roman people . <end>
<start> Kalends Iunias triumphavit de Cheruscis Chattisque et Angrivariis quaeque aliae nationes usque ad Albim colunt . <end>$$<start> a chapel to the Julian family , and statues at Bovillae to the Divine Augustus . <end>
<start> bellumque , quia conficere prohibitus erat , pro confecto accipiebatur . <end>$$<start> The admiration of the beholders was heightened by the striking comeliness of the general and the chariot which bore his five children . <end>
<start> augebat intuentium visus eximia ipsius species currusque quinque liberis onustus . <end>$$<start> Still , there was a latent dread when they remembered how unfortunate in the case of Drusus , his father , had been the favour of the crowd . <end>
<start> sed suberat occulta formido , reputantibus haud prosperum in Druso patre eius favorem vulgi , avunculum eiusdem Marcellum flagrantibus plebis studiis intra inventam ereptum , brevis et infaustos populi Romani amores . <end>$$<start> how his uncle Marcellus , regarded by the city populace with passionate enthusiasm , had been snatched from them while yet a youth , and how short-lived and ill-starred were the attachments of the Roman people . <end>
<start> Ceterum Tiberius nomine Germanici trecenos plebi sestertios viritim dedit seque collegam consulatui eius destinavit . <end>$$<start> Tiberius meanwhile in the name of Germanicus gave every one of the city populace three hundred sesterces , and nominated himself his colleague in the consulship . <end>
<start> nec ideo sincerae caritatis fidem adsecutus amoliri iuvenem specie honoris statuit struxitque causas aut forte oblatas arripuit . <end>$$<start> Still , failing to obtain credit for sincere affection , he resolved to get the young prince out of the way , under pretence of conferring distinction , and for this he invented reasons , or eagerly fastened on such as chance presented . <end>
<start> rex Archelaus quinquagesimum annum Cappadocia potiebatur , invisus Tiberio quod eum Rhodi agentem nullo officio coluisset . <end>$$<start> King Archelaus had been in possession of Cappadocia for fifty years , and Tiberius hated him because he had not shown him any mark of respect while he was at Rhodes . <end>
<start> nec id Archelaus per superbiam omiserat , sed ab intimis Augusti monitus , quia florente Gaio Caesare missoque ad res Orientis intuta Tiberii amicitia credebatur . <end>$$<start> This neglect of Archelaus was not due to pride , but was suggested by the intimate friends of Augustus , because , when Caius Caesar was in his prime and had charge of the affairs of the East , Tiberius's friendship was thought to be dangerous . <end>
<start> ut versa Caesarum subole imperium adeptus est , elicit Archelaum matris litteris , quae non dissimulatis filii offensionibus clementiam offerebae , si ad precandum veniret . <end>$$<start> When , after the extinction of the family of the Caesars , Tiberius acquired the empire , he enticed Archelaus by a letter from his mother , who without concealing her son's displeasure promised mercy if he would come to beg for it . <end>
<start> ille ignarus doli vel , si intellegere crederetur , vim metuens in urbem properat . <end>$$<start> Archelaus , either quite unsuspicious of treachery , or dreading compulsion , should it be thought that he saw through it , hastened to Rome . <end>
<start> exceptusque immiti a principe et mox accusatus in senatu , non ob crimina quae fingebantur sed angore , simul fessus senio et quia regibus aequa , nedum infima insolita sunt , finem vitae sponte an fato implevit . <end>$$<start> There he was received by a pitiless emperor , and soon afterwards was arraigned before the Senate In his anguish and in the weariness of old age , and from being unused , as a king , to equality , much less to degradation , not , certainly , from fear of the charges fabricated against him , he ended his life , by his own act or by a natural death . <end>
<start> regnum in provinciam redactum est , fructibusque eius levari posse centesimae vectigal professus Caesar ducentesimam in posterum statuit . <end>$$<start> His kingdom was reduced into a province , and Caesar declared that , with its revenues , the one per cent . <end>
<start> per idem tempus Antiocho Commagenorum , Philopatore Cilicum regibus defunctis turbabantur nationes , plerisque Romanum , aliis regium imperium cupientibus . <end>$$<start> tax could be lightened , which , for the future , he fixed at one-half per cent . <end>
<start> Igitur haec et de Armenia quae supra memoravi apud patres disseruit , nec posse motum Orientem nisi Germanici sapientia conponi nam suam aetatem vergere , Drusi nondum satis adolevisse . <end>$$<start> Tiberius accordingly discussed these matters and the affairs of Armenia , which I have already related , before the Senate . <end>
<start> tunc decreto patrum per missae Germanico provinciae quae mari dividuntur , maiusque imperium , quoquo adisset , quam iis qui sorte aut missu principis obtinerent sed Tiberius demoverat Syria Creticum Silanum , per adfinitatem conexam Germanico , quia Silani filia Neroni vetustissimo liberorum eius pacta erat , praefeceratque Gnaeus Pisonem , ingenio violentum et obsequii ignarum , insita ferocia a patre Pisone qui civili bello resurgentis in Africa partis acerrimo ministerio adversus Caesarem iuvit , mox Brutum et Cassium secutus concesso reditu petitione honorum abstinuit , donec ultro ambiretur delatum ab Augusto consulatum accipere . <end>$$<start> The commotions in the East , he said , could be quieted only by the wisdom , of Germanicus own life was on the decline , and Drusus had not yet reached his maturity Thereupon , by a decree of the Senate , the provinces beyond sea were entrusted to Germanicus , with greater powers wherever he went than were given to those who obtained their provinces by lot or by the emperor's appointment . <end>
<start> vix Tiberio concedere , liberos eius ut multum infra despectare . <end>$$<start> For there was division and discord in the court , with unexpressed partialities towards either Drusus or Germanicus . <end>
<start> credidere quidam data et a Tiberio occulta mandata . <end>$$<start> son and born of his own blood . <end>
<start> et Plancinam haud dubie Augusta monuit aemulatione muliebri Agrippinam insectandi divisa namque et discors aula erat tacitis in Drusum aut Germanicum studiis . <end>$$<start> As for Germanicus , his uncle's estrangement had increased the affection which all others felt for him , and there was the fact too that he had an advantage in the illustrious rank of his mother's family , among whom he could point to his grandfather Marcus Antonius and to his great-uncle Augustus . <end>
<start> Tiberius ut proprium et sui sanguinis Drusum fovebat Germanico alienatio patrui amorem apud ceteros auxerat , et quia claritudine matemi generis anteibat , avum Marcus Antonium , avunculum Augustum ferens . <end>$$<start> Drusus , on the other hand , had for his great-grandfather a Roman knight , Pomponius Atticus , who seemed to disgrace the ancestral images of the Claudii . <end>
<start> contra Druso proavus eques Romanus Pomponius Atticus dedecere Claudiorum imagines videbatur et coniunx Germanici Agrippina fecunditate ac fama Liviam uxorem Drusi praecellebat . <end>$$<start> Again , the consort of Germanicus , Agrippina , in number of children and in character , was superior to Livia , the wife of Drusus . <end>
<start> sed fratres egregie concordes et proximorum certaminibus inconcussi . <end>$$<start> Yet the brothers were singularly united , and were wholly unaffected by the rivalries of their kinsfolk . <end>
<start> Nec multo post Drusus in Illyricum missus est ut suesceret militiae studiaque exercitus pararet . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards Drusus was sent into Illyricum to be familiarised with military service , and to win the goodwill of the army . <end>
<start> simul iuvenem urbano luxu lascivientem melius in castris haberi Tiberius seque tutiorem rebatur utroque filio legiones obtinente . <end>$$<start> Tiberius also thought that it was better for the young prince , who was being demoralised by the luxury of the capital , to serve in a camp , while he felt himself the safer with both his sons in command of legions . <end>
<start> sed Suebi praetendebantur auxilium adversus Cheruscos orantes . <end>$$<start> However , he made a pretext of the Suevi , who were imploring help against the Cherusci . <end>
<start> nam discessu Romanorum ac vacui externo metu gentis adsuetudine et tum aemulatione gloriae arma in se verterant . <end>$$<start> For when the Romans had departed and they were free from the fear of an invader , these tribes , according to the custom of the race , and then specially as rivals in fame , had turned their arms against each other . <end>
<start> vis nationum , virtus ducum in aequo . <end>$$<start> The strength of the two nations , the valour of their chiefs were equal . <end>
<start> set Maroboduum regis nomen invisum apud popularis , Arminium pro libertate bellantem favor habebat . <end>$$<start> But the title of king rendered Maroboduus hated among his countrymen , while Arminius was regarded with favour as the champion of freedom . <end>
<start> Igitur non modo Cherusci sociique eorum , vetus Arminii miles , sumpsere bellum , sed e regno etiam Marobodui Suebae gentes , Semnones ac Langobardi , defecere ad eum . <end>$$<start> Thus it was not only the Cherusci and their allies , the old soldiers of Arminius , who took up arms , but even the Semnones and Langobardi from the kingdom of Maroboduus revolted to that chief . <end>
<start> quibus additis praepollebat , ni Inguiomerus cum manu clientium ad Maroboduum perfugisset , non aliam ob causam quam quia fratris filio iuveni patruus senex parere dedignabatur . <end>$$<start> With this addition he must have had an overwhelming superiority , had not Inguiomerus deserted with a troop of his dependants to Maroboduus , simply for the reason that the aged uncle scorned to obey a brother's youthful son . <end>
<start> deriguntur acies , pari utrimque spe , nec , ut olim apud Germanos , vagis incursibus aut disiectas per catervas quippe longa adversum nos militia insueverant sequi signa , subsidiis firmari , dicta imperatorum accipere . <end>$$<start> The armies were drawn up , with equal confidence on both sides , and there were not those desultory attacks or irregular bands , formerly so common with the Germans . <end>
<start> ac tunc Arminius equo conlustrans cuncta , ut quosque advectus erat , reciperatam libertatem , trucidatas legiones , spolia adhuc et tela Romanis derepta in manibus multorum ostentabat . <end>$$<start> Prolonged warfare against us had accustomed them to keep close to their standards , to have the support of reserves , and to take the word of command from their generals . <end>
<start> ac mox per dona et legationes petivisse foedus , proditorem patriae , satellitem Caesaris , haud minus infensis animis exturbandum quam Varum Quintilium interfecerint . <end>$$<start> a traitor to his country , a satellite of Caesar , who deserved to be driven out , with rage as furious as that with which they had slain Quintilius Varus . <end>
<start> meminissent modo tot proeliorum , quorum eventu et ad postremum eiectis Romanis satis probatum , penes utros summa belli fuerit . <end>$$<start> They should simply remember their many battles , the result of which , with the final expulsion of the Romans , sufficiently showed who could claim the crowning success in war . <end>
<start> Neque Maroboduns iactantia sui aut probris in hostem abstinebat , sed Inguiomerum tenens illo in corpore decus omne Cheruscorum , illius consiliis gesta quae prospere ceciderint testabatur vaecordem Arminium et rerum nescium alienam gloriam in se trahere , quoniam tres vagas legiones et ducem fraudis ignarum perfidia deceperit , magna cum clade Germaniae et ignominia sua , cum coniunx , cum fiius eius servitium adhuc tolerent . <end>$$<start> Nor did Maroboduus abstain from vaunts about himself or from revilings of the foe Clasping the hand of Inguiomerus , he protested that in the person before them centred all the renown of the Cherusci , that to his counsels was due whatever had ended successfully . <end>
<start> neque paenitere quod ipsorum in manu sit , integrum adversum Romanos bellum an pacem incruentam malint . <end>$$<start> The Cherusci and Langobardi were fighting for ancient renown or newly-won freedom . <end>
<start> non alias maiore mole concursum neque ambiguo magis eventu , fusis utrimque dextris cornibus . <end>$$<start> Never at any time was the shock of battle more tremendous or the issue more doubtful , as the right wings of both armies were routed . <end>
<start> sperabaturque rursum pugna , ni Maroboduns castra in collis subduxisset . <end>$$<start> Further fighting was expected , when Maroboduus withdrew his camp to the hills . <end>
<start> id signum perculsi fuit . <end>$$<start> This was a sign of discomfiture . <end>
<start> et transfugiis paulatim nudatus in Marcomanos concessit misitque legatos ad Tiberium oraturos auxilia . <end>$$<start> He was gradually stripped of his strength by desertions , and , having fled to the Marcomanni , he sent envoys to Tiberius with entreaties for help . <end>
<start> responsum est non lure eum adversus Cheruscos arma Romana invocare , qui pugnantis in eundem hostem Romanos nulla ope iuvisset . <end>$$<start> The answer was that he had no right to invoke the aid of Roman arms against the Cherusci , when he had rendered no assistance to the Romans in their conflict with the same enemy . <end>
<start> missus tamen Drusus , ut rettulimus , paci firmator . <end>$$<start> Drusus , however , was sent as I have related , to establish peace . <end>
<start> Eodem anno duodecim celebres Asiae urbes conlapsae nocturno motu terrae , quo inprovisior graviorque pestis fuit . <end>$$<start> That same year twelve famous cities of Asia fell by an earthquake in the night , so that the destruction was all the more unforeseen and fearful . <end>
<start> neque solitum in tali casu effugium subveniebat in aperta prorumpendi , quia diductis terris hauriebantur . <end>$$<start> Nor were there the means of escape usual in , such a disaster , by rushing out into the open country , for there people were swallowed up by the yawning earth . <end>
<start> sedisse inmensos montis , visa in arduo quae plana fuerint , effulsisse inter ruinam ignis memorant . <end>$$<start> Vast mountains , it is said , collapsed what had been level ground seemed to be raised aloft , and fires blazed out amid the ruin . <end>
<start> asperrima in Sardianos lues plurimum in eosdem misericordiae traxit nam centies sestertium pollicitus Caesar , et quantum aerario aut fisco pendebant in quinquennium remisit . <end>$$<start> The calamity fell most fatally on the inhabitants of Sardis , and it attracted to them the largest share of sympathy . <end>
<start> Temnios , Philadelphenos , Aegeatas , Apollonidenses , quique Mosteni aut Macedones Hyrcani vocantur , et Hierocaesariam , Myrinam , Cymen , Tmolum levari idem in tempus tributis mittique ex senatu placuit , qui praesentia spectaret refoveretque . <end>$$<start> it was decided , to be exempted from tribute for the same time , and some one was to be sent from the Senate to examine their actual condition and to relieve them . <end>
<start> delectus est Marcus Ateius e praetoriis , ne consulari obtinente Asiam aemulatio inter pares et ex eo impedimentum oreretur . <end>$$<start> Marcus Aletus , one of the expraetors , was chosen , from a fear that , as an exconsul was governor of Asia , there might be rivalry between men of equal rank , and consequent embarrassment . <end>
<start> Magnificam in publicum largitionem auxit Caesar haud minus grata liberalitate , quod bona Aemiliae Musae , locupletis intestatae , petita in fiscum , Aemilio Lepido , cuius e domo videbatur , et Pantulel divitis equitis Romani here ditatem , quamquam ipse heres in parte legeretur , tradidit Marcus Servilio , quem prioribus neque suspectis tabulis scriptum compererat , nobilitatem utriusque pecunia iuvandam praefatus . <end>$$<start> To his splendid public liberality the emperor added bounties no less popular The property of Aemilia Musa , a rich woman who died intestate , on which the imperial treasury had a claim , he handed over to Aemilius Lepidus , to whose family she appeared to belong . <end>
<start> neque hereditatem cuiusquam adiit nisi cum amicitia meruisset ignotos et aliis infensos eoque principem nuncupantis procul arcebat . <end>$$<start> In both these cases he said that noble rank ought to have the support of wealth Nor did he accept a legacy from any one unless he had earned it by friendship . <end>
<start> ceterum ut honestam innocentium paupertatem levavit , ita prodigos et ob flagitia egentis , Vibidium Varronem , Marium Nepotem , Appium Appianum , Cornelium Sullam , Quintus Vitellium movit senatu aut sponte cedere passus est . <end>$$<start> While , however , he relieved the honourable poverty of the virtuous , he expelled from the Senate or suffered voluntarily to retire spendthrifts whose vices had brought them to penury , like Vibidius Varro , Marius Nepos , Appius Appianus , Cornelius Sulla , and Quintus Vitellius . <end>
<start> Isdem temporibus deum aedis vetustate aut igni abolitas coeptasque ab Augusto dedicavit , Libero Liberaeque et Cereri iuxta circum maximum , quam Aulus Postumius dictator voverat , eodemque in loco aedem Florae ab Lucio et Marco Publiciis aedilibus constitutam , et Iano templum , quod apud forum holitorium Gaius Duilius struxerat , qui primus rem Romanam prospere mari gessit triumphumque navalem de Poenis meruit . <end>$$<start> About the same time he dedicated some temples of the gods , which had perished from age or from fire , and which Augustus had begun to restore These were temples to Liber , Libera , and Ceres , near the Great Circus , which last Aulus Postumius , when Dictator , had vowed . <end>
<start> Adolescebat interea lex maiestatis . <end>$$<start> Meantime the law of treason was gaining strength . <end>
<start> et Appuleiam Varillam , sororis Augusti neptem , quia probrosis sermonibus divum Augustum ac Tiberium et matrem eius inlusisset Caesarique conexa adulterio teneretur , maiestatis delator arcessebat . <end>$$<start> Adultery , it was thought , was sufficiently guarded against by the Julian law As to the charge of treason , the emperor insisted that it should be taken separately , and that she should be condemned if she had spoken irreverently of Augustus . <end>
<start> de adulterio satis caveri lege Iulia visum maiestatis crimen distingui Caesar postulavit damnarique , si qua de Augusto inreligiose dixisset in se iacta nolle ad cognitionem vocari . <end>$$<start> Her insinuations against himself he did not wish to be the subject of judicial inquiry When asked by the consul what he thought of the unfavourable speeches she was accused of having uttered against his mother , he said nothing . <end>
<start> interrogatus a consule quid de iis censeret quae de matre eius locuta secus argueretur reticuit . <end>$$<start> Afterwards , on the next day of the Senate's meeting , he even begged in his mother's name that no words of any kind spoken against her might in any case be treated as criminal . <end>
<start> adultero Manlio Italia atque Africa interdictum est . <end>$$<start> Her paramour , Manlius , was forbidden to live in Italy or Africa . <end>
<start> De praetore in locum Vipstani Galli , quem mors abstulerat , subrogando certamen incessit . <end>$$<start> A contest then arose about the election of a praetor in the room of Vipstanus Gallus , whom death had removed . <end>

<start> laetabatur Tiberius , cum inter filios eius et leges senatus disceptaret . <end>$$<start> Tiberius rejoiced to see a strife in the Senate between his sons and the law . <end>
<start> victa est sine dubio lex , sed neque statim et paucis suffragiis , quo modo etiam cum valerent leges vincebantur . <end>$$<start> Beyond question the law was beaten , but not at once , and only by a few votes , in the same way as laws were defeated even when they were in force . <end>

<start> valida ea gens et solitudinibus Africae propinqua , nullo etiam tum urbium cultu , cepit arma Maurosque accolas in bellum traxit dux et his , Mazippa . <end>$$<start> After a while , he marshalled them like regular soldiers , under standards and in troops , till at last he was regarded as the leader , not of an undisciplined rabble , but of the Musulamian people . <end>
<start> divisusque exercitus , ut Tacfarinas lectos viros et Romanum in modum armatos castris attineret , disciplina et imperiis suesceret , Mazippa levi cum copia incendia et caedis et terrorem circumferret . <end>$$<start> This powerful tribe , bordering on the deserts of Africa , and even then with none of the civilisation of cities , took up arms and drew their Moorish neighbours into the war . <end>
<start> coapulerantque Cinithios , haud spernendam nationem , in eadem , cum Furius Camillus pro consule Africae legionem et quod sub signis sociorum in unum conductos ad hostem duxit , modicam manum , si multitudinem Numidarum atque Maurorum spectares . <end>$$<start> These too had a leader , Mazippa The army was so divided that Tacfarinas kept the picked men who were armed in Roman fashion within a camp , and familiarised them with a commander's authority , while Mazippa , with light troops , spread around him fire , slaughter , and consternation . <end>
<start> igitur legio medio , leves cohortes duaeque alae in cornibus locantur . <end>$$<start> It was by the hope of victory that they were lured on only to be defeated . <end>

<start> igitur paucos dies insumpsit reficiendae classi simul sinus Actiaca victoria inclutos et sacratas ab Augusto manubias castraque Antonii cum recordatione maiorum suorum adiit . <end>$$<start> He accordingly devoted a few days to the repair of his fleet , and , at the same time , in remembrance of his ancestors , he visited the bay which the victory of Actium had made famous , the spoils consecrated by Augustus , and the camp of Antonius . <end>
<start> namque ei , ut memoravi , avunculus Augustus , avus Antonius erant , magnaque illic imago tristium laetorumque . <end>$$<start> For , as I have said , Augustus was his great-uncle , Antonius his grandfather , and vivid images of disaster and success rose before him on the spot . <end>
<start> hinc ventum Athenas , foederique sociae et vetustae urbis datum ut uno lictore uteretur . <end>$$<start> Thence he went to Athens , and there , as a concession to our treaty with an allied and ancient city , he was attended only by a single lictor . <end>
<start> excepere Graeci quaesitissimis honoribus , vetera suorum facta dictaque praeferentes quo plus dignationis adulatio haberet . <end>$$<start> The Greeks welcomed him with the most elaborate honours , and brought forward all the old deeds and sayings of their countrymen , to give additional dignity to their flattery . <end>
<start> Petita inde Euboca tramisit Lesbum ubi Agrippina novissimo partu Iuliam edidit . <end>$$<start> Thence he directed his course to Euboea and crossed to Lesbos , where Agrippina for the last time was confined and gave birth to Julia . <end>
<start> tum extrema Asiae Perinthumque ac Byzantium , Thraecias urbes , mox Propontidis angustias et os Ponticum intrat , cupidine veteres locos et fama celebratos noscendi . <end>$$<start> He then penetrated to the remoter parts of the province of Asia , visited the Thracian cities , Perinthus and Byzantium . <end>
<start> pariterque provincias internis certaminibus aut magistratuum iniuriis fessas refovebat . <end>$$<start> next , the narrow strait of the Propontis and the entrance of the Pontus , from an anxious wish to become acquainted with those ancient and celebrated localities . <end>
<start> atque illum in regressu sacra Samothracum visere nitentem obvii aquilones depulere . <end>$$<start> He gave relief , as he went , to provinces which had been exhausted by internal feuds or by the oppressions of governors . <end>
<start> igitur adito Ilio quaeque ibi varietate fortunae et nostri origine veneranda , relegit Asiam adpellitque Colophona ut Clarii Apollinis oraculo uteretur . <end>$$<start> In his return he attempted to see the sacred mysteries of the Samothracians , but north winds which he encountered drove him aside from his course . <end>
<start> non femina illic , ut apud Delphos , sed certis e familiis et ferme Mileto accitus sacerdos numerum modo consultantium et nomina audit . <end>$$<start> And so after visiting Ilium and surveying a scene venerable from the vicissitudes of fortune and as the birth-place of our people , he coasted back along Asia , and touched at Colophon , to consult the oracle of the Clarian Apollo . <end>
<start> tum in specum degressus , hausta fontis arcani aqua , ignarus plerumque litterarum et carminum edit responsa versibus compositis super rebus quas quis mente concepit . <end>$$<start> There , it is not a woman , as at Delphi , but a priest chosen from certain families , generally from Miletus , who ascertains simply the number and the names of the applicants . <end>
<start> At Gnaeus Piso quo properantius destinata inciperet civitatem Atheniensium turbido incessu exterritam oratione saeva increpat , oblique Germanicum perstringens quod contra decus Romani nominis non Atheniensis tot cladibus extinctos , sed conluviem illam nationum comitate nimia coluisset hos enim esse Mithridatis adversus Sullam , Antonii adversus divum Augustum socios . <end>$$<start> Cneius Piso meanwhile , that he might the sooner enter on his design , terrified the citizens of Athens by his tumultuous approach , and then reviled them in a bitter speech , with indirect reflections on Germanicus , who , he said , had derogated from the honour of the Roman name in having treated with excessive courtesy , not the people of Athens , who indeed had been exterminated by repeated disasters , but a miserable medley of tribes . <end>
<start> etiam vetena obiectabat , quae in Macedones inprospere , violenter in suos fecissent , offensus urbi propria quoque ira quia Theophilum quendam Areo iudicio falsi damnatum precibus suis non concederent . <end>$$<start> As for the men before him , they had been Mithridates's allies against Sulla , allies of Antonius against the Divine Augustus . <end>
<start> exim navigatione celeri per Cycladas ee compendia maris adsequitur Germanicum apud insulam Rhodum , haud nescium quibus insectationibus petitus foret sed tanta mansuetudine agebat ut , cum orta tempestas raperet in abrupta possetque interitus inimici ad casum referri , miserit triremis quarum subsidio discrimini eximeretur . <end>$$<start> He taunted them too with the past , with their ill-success against the Macedonians , their violence to their own countrymen , for he had his own special grudge against this city , because they would not spare at his intercession one Theophilus whom the Areopagus had condemned for forgery . <end>
<start> neque tamen mitigatus Piso , et vix diei moram perpessus linquit Germanicum praevenitque . <end>$$<start> Then , by sailing rapidly and by the shortest route through the Cyclades , he overtook Germanicus at the island of Rhodes . <end>
<start> et postquam Syriam ac legiones attigit , largitione , ambitu , infimos manipularium iuvando , cum veteres centuriones , severos tribunos demoveret locaque eorum clientibus suis vel deterrimo cuique attribueret , desidiam in castris , licentiam in urbibus , vagum ac lascivientem per agros militem sineret , eo usque corruptionis provectus est ut sermone vulgi parens legionum haberetur . <end>$$<start> The prince was not ignorant of the slanders with which he had been assailed , but his good nature was such that when a storm arose and drove Piso on rocks , and his enemy's destruction could have been referred to chance , he sent some triremes , by the help of which he might be rescued from danger . <end>
<start> nec Plancina se intra decora feminis tenebat ,  . <end>$$<start> But this did not soften Piso's heart . <end>
<start> nota haec Germanico , sed praeverti ad Armenios instantior cura fuit . <end>$$<start> Of all this Germanicus was aware , but his most pressing anxiety was to be first in reaching Armenia . <end>
<start> Ambigua gens ea antiquitus hominum ingeniis et situ terrarum , quoniam nostris provinciis late praetenta penitus ad Medos porrigitur . <end>$$<start> This had been of old an unsettled country from the character of its people and from its geographical position , bordering , as it does , to a great extent on our provinces and stretching far away to Media . <end>
<start> maximisque imperiis interiecti et saepius discordes sunt , adversus Romanos odio et in Parthum invidia . <end>$$<start> It lies between two most mighty empires , and is very often at strife with them , hating Rome and jealous of Parthia . <end>
<start> regem illa tempestate non habobant , amoto Vonone sed favor nationis inclinabat in Zenonem , Polemonis regis Pontici filium , quod is prima ab infantia instituta et cultum Armeniorum aemulatus , venatu epulis et quae alia barbari celebrant , proceres plebemque iuxta de vinxerat . <end>$$<start> It had at this time no king , Vonones having been expelled , but the nation's likings inclined towards Zeno , son of Polemon , king of Pontus , who from his earliest infancy had imitated Armenian manners and customs , loving the chase , the banquet , and all the popular pastimes of barbarians , and who had thus bound to himself chiefs and people alike . <end>
<start> igitur Germanicus in urbe Artaxata adprobantibus nobilibus , circumfusa multitudine , insigne regium capiti eius imposuit . <end>$$<start> Germanicus accordingly , in the city of Artaxata , with the approval of the nobility , in the presence of a vast multitude , placed the royal diadem on his head . <end>
<start> ceteri venerantes regem Artaxiam consalutavere , quod illi vocabulum indiderant ex nomine urbis . <end>$$<start> All paid him homage and saluted him as King Artaxias , which name they gave him from the city . <end>
<start> at Cappadoces in formam provinciae redacti Quintus Veranium legatum accepere . <end>$$<start> Cappadocia meanwhile , which had been reduced to the form of a province , received as its governor Quintus Veranius . <end>
<start> et quaedam ex regiis tributis deminuta quo mitius Romanum imperium speraretur . <end>$$<start> Some of the royal tributes were diminished , to inspire hope of a gentler rule under Rome . <end>
<start> Commagenis Quintus Servaeus praeponitur , tum primum ad ius praetoris translatis . <end>$$<start> Quintus Servaeus was appointed to Commagene , then first put under a praetor's jurisdiction . <end>
<start> Cunctaque socialia prospere composita non ideo laetum Germanicum habebant ob superbiam Pisonis qui iussus partem legionum ipse aut per filium in Armeniam ducere utrumque neglexerat Cyrri demum apud hiberna decumae legionis convenere , firmato vultu , Piso adversus metum , Germanicus ne minari crederetur . <end>$$<start> Successful as was this settlement of all the interests of our allies , it gave Germanicus little joy because of the arrogance of Piso Though he had been ordered to march part of the legions into Armenia under his own or his son's command , he had neglected to do either . <end>
<start> sed amici accendendis offensionibus callidi intendere vera , adgerere falsa ipsumque et Plancinam et filios variis modis criminari . <end>$$<start> But friends who knew well how to inflame a quarrel , exaggerated what was true and added lies , alleging various charges against Piso , Plancina , and their sons . <end>
<start> postremo paucis familiarium adhibitis sermo coeptus a Caesare , qualem ira et dissimulatio gignit , responsum a Pisone precibus contumacibus . <end>$$<start> At last , in the presence of a few intimate associates , Germanicus addressed him in language such as suppressed resentment suggests , to which Piso replied with haughty apologies . <end>
<start> discesseruntque apertis odiis . <end>$$<start> They parted in open enmity . <end>
<start> post quae rarus in tribunali Caesaris Piso , et si quando adsideret , atrox ac dissentire manifestus . <end>$$<start> After this Piso was seldom seen at Caesar's tribunal , and if he ever sat by him , it was with a sullen frown and a marked display of opposition . <end>
<start> vox quoque eius audita est in convivio , cum apud regem Nabataeorum coronae aureae magno pondere Caesari et Agrippinae , leves Pisoni et ceteris offerrentur , principis Romani , non Parthi regis filio eas epulas dari . <end>$$<start> He was even heard to say at a banquet given by the king of the Nabataeans , when some golden crowns of great weight were presented to Caesar and Agrippina and light ones to Piso and the rest , that the entertainment was given to the son of a Roman emperor , not of a Parthian king . <end>
<start> abiecitque simul coronam et multa in luxum addidit quae Germanico quamquam acerba tolerabantur tamen . <end>$$<start> At the same time he threw his crown on the ground , with a long speech against luxury , which , though it angered Germanicus , he still bore with patience . <end>
<start> Inter quae ab rege Parthorum Artabano legati venere . <end>$$<start> Meantime envoys arrived from Artabanus , king of the Parthians . <end>
<start> miserat amicitiam ac foedus memoraturos , et cupere novari dextras , daturumque honori Germanici ut ripam Euphratis accederet petere interim ne Vonones in Syria haberetur neu proceres gentium propinquis nuntiis ad discordias traheret . <end>$$<start> He had sent them to recall the memory of friendship and alliance , with an assurance that he wished for a renewal of the emblems of concord , and that he would in honour of Germanicus yield the point of advancing to the bank of the Euphrates . <end>
<start> ue magnifice , de adventu regis et cultu sui cum decore ac modestia respondit . <end>$$<start> as to the king's visit and the respect shown to himself , it was graceful and modest . <end>
<start> Vonones Pompeiopolim , Ciliciae maritimam urbem , amotus est . <end>$$<start> Vonones was removed to Pompeiopolis , a city on the coast of Cilicia . <end>
<start> datum id non modo 6 precibus Artabani , sed contumeliae Pisonis cui gratissimus erat ob plurima oflicia et dona quibus Plancinam devinxerat . <end>$$<start> This was not merely a concession to the request of Artabanus , but was meant as an affront to Piso , who had a special liking for Vonones , because of the many attentions and presents by which he had won Plancina's favour . <end>
<start> Marcus Silano Lucius Norbano consulibus Germanicus Aegyptum proficiscitur cognoscendae antiquitatis . <end>$$<start> In the consulship of Marcus Silanus and Lucius Norbanus , Germanicus set out for Egypt to study its antiquities . <end>

<start> Tiberius cultu habituque eius lenibus verbis perstricto , acerrime increpuit quod contra instituta Augusti non sponte principis Alexandriam introisset . <end>$$<start> Tiberius having gently expressed disapproval of his dress and manners , pronounced a very sharp censure on his visit to Alexandria without the emperor's leave , contrary to the regulations of Augustus . <end>
<start> Sed Germanicus nondum comperto profectionem eam incusari Nilo subvehebatur , orsus oppido a Canopo . <end>$$<start> Germanicus , however , who had not yet learnt how much he was blamed for his expedition , sailed up the Nile from the city of Canopus as his starting-point . <end>
<start> condidere id Spartani ob sepultum illic rectorem navis Canopum , qua tempestate Menelaus Graeciam repetens diversum ad mare terramque Libyam deiectus est . <end>$$<start> Spartans founded the place because Canopus , pilot of one of their ships , had been buried there , when Menelaus on his return to Greece was driven into a distant sea and to the shores of Libya . <end>
<start> inde proximum amnis os dicatum Herculi , quem indigenae ortum apud se et antiquissimum perhibent eosque , qui postea pari virtute fuerint , in cognomentum eius adscitos . <end>$$<start> Thence he went to the river's nearest mouth , dedicated to a Hercules who , the natives say , was born in the country and was the original hero , others , who afterwards showed like valour , having received his name . <end>

<start> Ceterum Germanicus aliis quoque miraculis intendit animum , quorum praecipua fuere Memnonis saxca effigies , ubi radiis solis icta est , vocalem sonum reddens , disiectasque inter et vix pervias arenas instar montium eductae pyramides certamine et opibus regum , lacusque effossa humo , superfluentis Nili receptacula . <end>$$<start> But Germanicus also bestowed attention on other wonders Chief of these were the stone image of Memnon , which , when struck by the sun's rays , gives out the sound of a human voice . <end>

<start> extat oratio qua magnitudinem viri , violentiam subiectarum ei gentium et quam propinquns Italiae hostis , suaque in destruendo eo consilia extulit . <end>$$<start> But in the Senate he maintained that Philip had not been so formidable to the Athenians , or Pyrrhus or Antiochus to the Roman people , as was Maroboduus . <end>

<start> igitur Rhescuporim quoque , Thraeciae regem , astu adgreditur . <end>$$<start> Tiberius was the more delighted at having established peace by wise policy than if he had finished a war by battle . <end>
<start> omnem eam nationem Rhoemetalces tenuerat . <end>$$<start> And so next he planned a crafty scheme against Rhescuporis , king of Thrace . <end>
<start> quo defuncto Augustus partem Thraecum Rhescuporidi fratri eius , partem filio Cotyi permisit . <end>$$<start> That entire country had been in the possession of Rhoemetalces , after whose death Augustus assigned half to the king's brother Rhescuporis , half to his son Cotys . <end>

<start> Nihil aeque Tiberium anxium habebat quam ne composita turbarentur . <end>$$<start> Nothing made Tiberius so uneasy as an apprehension of the disturbance of any settlement . <end>
<start> deligit centurionem qui nuntiaret regibus ne armis disceptarent . <end>$$<start> He commissioned a centurion to tell the kings not to decide their dispute by arms . <end>

<start> nec diu dubitatum de tempore , loco , dein condicionibus , cum alter facilitate , alter fraude cuncta inter se concederent acciperentque . <end>$$<start> There was little hesitation in fixing on a time , a place , finally on terms , as every point was mutually conceded and accepted , by the one out of good nature , by the other with a treacherous intent . <end>
<start> Rhescuporis sanciendo , ut dictitabat , foederi convivium adicit , tractaque in multam noctem laetitia per epulas ac vinolentiam incautum Cotyn postquam dolum intellexerat , sacra regni , eiusdem familiae deos et hospitalis mensas obtestantem catenis onerat . <end>$$<start> Rhescuporis , to ratify the treaty , as he said , further proposed a banquet and when their mirth had been prolonged far into the night , and Cotys amid the feasting and the wine was unsuspicious of danger , he loaded him with chains , though he appealed , on perceiving the perfidy , to the sacred character of a king , to the gods of their common house , and to the hospitable board . <end>
<start> Thraeciaque omni potitus scripsit ad Tiberium structas sibi insidias , praeventum insidiatorem . <end>$$<start> Having possessed himself of all Thrace , he wrote word to Tiberius that a plot had been formed against him , and that he had forestalled the plotter . <end>

<start> simul missi a Pisone incusabantur ut valetudinis adversa rimantes . <end>$$<start> Piso too was accused of sending emissaries to note curiously every unfavourable symptom of the illness . <end>
<start> Ea Germanico haud minus ira quam per metum accepta . <end>$$<start> Germanicus heard of all this with anger , no less than with fear . <end>

<start> Caesar paulisper ad spem erectus , dein fesso corpore ubi finis aderat , adsistentis amicos in hunc modum adloquitur si fato concederem , iustus mihi dolor etiam adversus deos esset , quod me parentibus liberis patriae intra inventam praematuro exitu raperent nunc scelere Pisonis et Plancinae interceptus ultimas preces pectoribus vestris relinquo referatis patri ac fratri , quibus acerbitatibus dilaceratus , quibus insidiis circumventus miserrimam vitam pessima morte finierim . <end>$$<start> For a brief space the prince's hopes rose then his frame became exhausted , and , as his end drew near , he spoke as follows to the friends by his side : - Were I succumbing to nature , I should have just ground of complaint even against the gods for thus tearing me away in my youth by an untimely death from parents , children , country . <end>
<start> si quos spes meae , si quos propinquus sanguis , etiam quos invidia erga viventem movebat , inlacrimabunt quondam florentem et tot bellorum superstitem muliebri fraude cecidisse . <end>$$<start> Now , cut off by the wickedness of Piso and Plancina , I leave to your hearts my last entreaties . <end>

<start> iuravere amici dextram morientis contingentes spiritum ante quam ultionem amissuros . <end>$$<start> His friends clasped the dying man's right hand , and swore that they would sooner lose life than revenge . <end>
<start> Tum ad uxorem versus per memoriam sui , per communis liberos oravit exueret ferociam , saevienti fortunae summitteret animum , neu regressa in urbem aemulatione potentiae validiores inritaret . <end>$$<start> He then turned to his wife and implored her by the memory of her husband and by their common offspring to lay aside her high spirit , to submit herself to the cruel blows of fortune , and not , when she returned to Rome , to enrage by political rivalry those who were stronger than herself . <end>
<start> haec palam et alia secreto per quae ostendisse credebatur metum ex Tiberio . <end>$$<start> This was said openly other words were whispered , pointing , it was supposed , to his fears from Tiberius . <end>
<start> neque multo post extinguitur , ingenti luctu provinciae et circumiacentium populorum . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards he expired , to the intense sorrow of the province and of the neighbouring peoples . <end>
<start> indoluere exterae nationes regesque tanta illi comitas in socios , mansuetudo in hostis . <end>$$<start> Foreign nations and kings grieved over him , so great was his courtesy to allies , his humanity to enemies . <end>
<start> visuque et auditu iuxta venerabilis , cum magnitudinem et gravitatem summae fortunae retineret , invidiam et adrogantiam eflugerat . <end>$$<start> He inspired reverence alike by look and voice , and while he maintained the greatness and dignity of the highest rank , he had escaped the hatred that waits on arrogance . <end>
<start> Funus sine imaginibus et pompa per laudes ac memoriam virtutum eius celebre fuit . <end>$$<start> His funeral , though it lacked the family statues and procession , was honoured by panegyrics and a commemoration of his virtues . <end>
<start> nam utrumque corpore decoro , genere insigni , haud multum triginta annos egressum , suorum insidiis externas inter gentis occidisse sed hunc mitem erga amicos , modicum voluptatum , uno matrimonio , certis liberis egisse , neque minus proeliatorem , etiam si temeritas afuerit praepeditusque sit perculsas tot victoriis Germanias servitio premere . <end>$$<start> He was too no less a warrior , though rashness he had none , and , though after having cowed Germany by his many victories , he was hindered from crushing it into subjection . <end>
<start> quod si solus arbiter rerum , si lure et nomine regio fuisset , tanto promptius adsecuturum gloriam militiae quantum clementia , temperantia , ceteris bonis artibus praestitisset . <end>$$<start> Had he had the sole control of affairs , had he possessed the power and title of a king , he would have attained military glory as much more easily as he had excelled Alexander in clemency , in self-restraint , and in all other virtues . <end>
<start> corpus antequam cremaretur nudatum in foro Antiochensium , qui locus sepulturae destinabatur , praetuleritne veneficii signa parum constitit . <end>$$<start> As to the body which , before it was burnt , lay bare in the forum at Antioch , its destined place of burial , it is doubtful whether it exhibited the marks of poisoning . <end>
<start> Consultatum inde inter legatos quique alii senatorum aderant quisnam Syriae praeficeretur . <end>$$<start> Then followed a deliberation among the generals and other senators present about the appointment of a governor to Syria . <end>
<start> et ceteris modice nisis , inter Vibium Marsum et Gnaeus Sentium diu quaesitum dein Marsus seniori et acrius tendenti Sentio concessit . <end>$$<start> The contest was slight among all but Vibius Marsus and Cneius Sentius , between whom there was a long dispute . <end>
<start> isque infamem veneficiis ea in provincia et Plancinae percaram nomine Martinam in urbem misit , postulantibus Vitellio ac Veranio ceterisque qui crimina et accusationem tamquam adversus receptos iam reos instruebant . <end>$$<start> Finally Marsus yielded to Sentius as an older and keener competitor Sentius at once sent to Rome a woman infamous for poisonings in the province and a special favourite of Plancina , Martina by name , on the demand of Vitellius and Veranius and others , who were preparing the charges and the indictment as if a prosecution had already been commenced . <end>
<start> At Agrippina , quamquam defessa luctu et corpore aegro , omnium tamen quae ultionem morarentur intolerans ascendit classem cum cineribus Germanici et liberis , miserantibus cunctis quod femina nobilitate princeps , pulcherrimo modo matrimonio inter venerantis gratantisque aspici solita , tunc feralis reliquias sinu ferret , incerta ultionis , anxia sui et infelici fecunditate fortunae totiens obnoxia . <end>$$<start> Agrippina meantime , worn out though she was with sorrow and bodily weakness , yet still impatient of everything which might delay her vengeance , embarked with the ashes of Germanicus and with her children , pitied by all . <end>
<start> quo intemperanter accepto caedit victimas , adit templa , neque ipse gaudium moderans et magis insolescente Plancina , quae luctum amissae sororis tum primum laeto cultu mutavit . <end>$$<start> while Plancina's insolence increased , and she then for the first time exchanged for the gayest attire the mourning she had worn for her lost sister . <end>
<start> Adfluebant centuriones monebantque prompta illi legionum studia repeteret provinciam non iure ablatam et vacuam . <end>$$<start> Centurions streamed in , and hinted to Piso that he had the sympathy of the legions at his command . <end>
<start> igitur quid agendum consultanti Marcus Piso filius properandum in urbem censebat nihil adhuc inexpiabile admissum neque suspiciones imbecillas aut inania famae pertimescenda . <end>$$<start> Go back , they said , to the province which has not been rightfully taken from you , and is still vacant . <end>
<start> discordiam erga Germanicum odio fortasse dignam , non poena . <end>$$<start> While he deliberated what he was to do , his son , Marcus Piso , advised speedy return to Rome . <end>
<start> nec duraturos in partibus centuriones militesque apud quos recens imperatoris sui memoria et penitus infixus in Caesares amor praevaleret . <end>$$<start> But if you return , should Sentius resist you , civil war is begun , and you will not retain on your side the centurions and soldiers , who are powerfully swayed by the yet recent memory of their general and by a deep-rooted affection for the Caesars . <end>
<start> Contra Domitius Celer , ex intima eius amicitia , disseruit utendum eventu Pisonem , non Sentium Syriae praepositum . <end>$$<start> Against this view Domitius Celer , one of Piso's intimate friends , argued that he ought to profit by the opportunity . <end>
<start> huic fascis et ius praetoris , huic legiones datas . <end>$$<start> It was to Piso that the symbols of power and a praetor's jurisdiction and the legions had been given . <end>
<start> si quid hostile ingruat , quem iustius arma oppositurum quam qui legati auctoritatem et propria mandata acceperit . <end>$$<start> In case of a hostile menace , who would more rightfully confront it by arms than the man who had received the authority and special commission of a governor . <end>
<start> relinquendum etiam rumoribus tempus quo senescant plerumque innocentis recenti invidiae imparis . <end>$$<start> And as for rumours , it is best to leave time in which they may die away . <end>
<start> at si teneat exercitum , augeat viris , multa quae provideri non possint fortuito in melius casura . <end>$$<start> Often the innocent cannot stand against the first burst of unpopularity . <end>
<start> an festinamus cum Germanici cineribus adpellere , ut te inauditum et indefensum planctus Agrippinae ac vulgus imperitum primo rumore rapiant . <end>$$<start> But if Piso possesses himself of the army , and increases his resources , much which cannot be foreseen will haply turn out in his favour . <end>
<start> est tibi Augustae conscientia , est Caesaris favor , sed in occulto , et perisse Germanicum nulli iactantius maerent quam qui maxime laetantur . <end>$$<start> You have on your side the complicity of Augusta and the emperor's favour , though in secret , and none mourn more ostentatiously over the death of Germanicus than those who most rejoice at it . <end>
<start> Haud magna mole Piso promptus ferocibos in sententiam trahitur missisque ad Tiberium epistulis incusat Germanicum luxus et superbiae . <end>$$<start> Without much difficulty Piso , who was ever ready for violent action , was led into this view . <end>
<start> simul Domitium impositum triremi vitare litorum oram praeterque insulas lato mari pergere in Syriam iubet . <end>$$<start> At the same time he put Domitius on board a trireme , with an order to avoid the coast and to push on to Syria through the open sea away from the islands . <end>
<start> concurrentis desertores per manipulo componit , armat lixas traiectisque in continentem navibus vexillum tironum in Syriam euntium intercipit , regulis Cilicum ut se auxiliis iuvarent scribit , haud ignavo ad ministeria belli iuvene Pisone , quamquam suscipiendum bellum abnuisset . <end>$$<start> He formed into regular companies the deserters who flocked to him , armed the camp-followers , crossed with his ships to the mainland , intercepted a detachment of new levies on their way to Syria , and wrote word to the petty kings of Cilicia that they were to help him with auxiliaries , the young Piso actively assisting in all the business of war , though he had advised against undertaking it . <end>
<start> Igitur oram Lyciae ac Pamphyliae praelegentes , obviis navibus quae Agrippinam vehebant , utrimque infensi arma primo expediere dein mutua formidine non ultra iurgium processum est , Marsusque Vibius nuntiavit Pisoni Romam ad dicendam causam veniret . <end>$$<start> And so they coasted along Lycia and Pamphylia , and on meeting the fleet which conveyed Agrippina , both sides in hot anger at first armed for battle , and then in mutual fear confined themselves to revilings , Marsus Vibius telling Piso that he was to go to Rome to defend himself . <end>
<start> ille eludens respondit adfuturum ubi praetor qui de veneficiis quaereret reo atque accusatoribus diem prodixisset . <end>$$<start> Piso mockingly replied that he would be there as soon as the praetor who had to try poisoning cases had fixed a day for the accused and his prosecutors . <end>
<start> interim Domitius Laodiciam urbem Syriae adpulsus , cum hiberna sextae legionis peteret , quod eam maxime novis consiliis idoneam rebatur , a Pacuvio legato praevenitur . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile Domitius having landed at Laodicea , a city of Syria , as he was on his way to the winter-quarters of the sixth legion , which was , he believed , particularly open to revolutionary schemes , was anticipated by its commander Pacuvius . <end>
<start> id Sentius Pisoni per litteras aperit monetque ne castra corruptoribus , ne provinciam bello temptet . <end>$$<start> Of this Sentius informed Piso in a letter , and warned him not to disturb the armies by agents of corruption or the province by war . <end>
<start> quosque Germanici memores aut inimicis eius adversos cognoverat , contrahit , magnitudinem imperatoris identidem ingerens et rem publicam armis peti ducitque validam manum et proelio paratam . <end>$$<start> He gathered round him all whom he knew to cherish the memory of Germanicus , and to be opposed to his enemies , dwelling repeatedly on the greatness of the general , with hints that the State was being threatened with an armed attack , and he put himself at the head of a strong force , prepared for battle . <end>
<start> Nec Piso , quamquam coepta secus cadebant , omisit tutissima e praesentibus , sed castellum Ciliciae munitum admodum , cui nomen Celenderis , occupat . <end>$$<start> Piso , too , though his first attempts were unsuccessful , did not omit the safest precautions under present circumstances , but occupied a very strongly fortified position in Cilicia , named , Celenderis . <end>
<start> nam admixtis desertoribus et tirone nuper intercepto suisque et Plancinae servitiis auxilia Cilicum quae reguli miserane in numerum legionis composuerat . <end>$$<start> And he protested that he , though Caesar's legate , was kept out of the province which Caesar had given him , not by the legions (for he had come at their invitation) but by Sentius , who was veiling private animosity under lying charges . <end>
<start> Caesarisque se legatum testabatur provincia quam is dedisset arceri , non a legionibus (earum quippe accitu venire) , sed a Sentio privatum odium falsis criminibus tegente . <end>$$<start> Only , he said , stand in battle array , and the soldiers will not fight when they see that Piso whom they themselves once called 'father , ' is the stronger , if right is to decide . <end>
<start> consisterent in acie , non pugnaturis militibus ubi Pisonem ab ipsis parentem quondam appellatum , si iure ageretur , potiorem , si armis , non invalidum vidissent tum pro munimentis castelli manipulos explicat colle arduo et derupto . <end>$$<start> if arms , is far from powerless He then deployed his companies before the lines of the fortress on a high and precipitous hill , with the sea surrounding him on every other side . <end>
<start> contra veterani ordinibus ac subsidiis instructi hinc militum , inde locorum asperitas , sed non animus , non spes , ne tela quidem nisi agrestia aut subitum in usum properata . <end>$$<start> When they came to fighting , the result was doubtful only while the Roman cohorts were struggling up to level ground . <end>
<start> ut venere in manus , non ultra dubitatum quam dum Romanae cohortes in aequum eniterentur vertunt terga Cilices seque castello claudunt . <end>$$<start> then , the Cilicians turned their backs and shut themselves up within the fortress . <end>
<start> Interim Piso classem haud procul opperientem adpugnare frustra temptavit . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile Piso vainly attempted an attack on the fleet which waited at a distance . <end>
<start> regressusque et pro muris , modo semet adflictando , modo singulos nomine ciens , praemiis vocans , seditionem coeptabat , adeoque commoverat ut signifer legionis sextae signum ad eum transtulerit . <end>$$<start> he then went back , and as he stood before the walls , now smiting his breast , now calling on individual soldiers by name , and luring them on by rewards , sought to excite a mutiny . <end>
<start> tum Sentius occanere cornua tubasque et peti aggerem , erigi scalas iussit ac promptissimum quemque succedere , alios tormentis hastas saxa et faces ingerere . <end>$$<start> He had so far roused them that a standard bearer of the sixth legion went over to him with his standard . <end>
<start> non receptae condiciones nec aliud quam naves et tutum in urbem iter concessum est . <end>$$<start> The proposed terms were refused , and all that was granted him were some ships and a safe return to Rome . <end>
<start> At Romae , postquam Germanici valetudo percrebuit cunctaque ut ex longinquo aucta in deterius adferebantur , dolor ira , et erumpebant questus . <end>$$<start> There meantime , when the illness of Germanicus was universally known , and all news , coming , as it did , from a distance , exaggerated the danger , there was grief and indignation . <end>
<start> ideo nimirum in extremas terras relegatum , ideo Pisoni permissam provinciam . <end>$$<start> There was too an outburst of complaint . <end>
<start> passim silentia et gemitus , nihil compositum in ostentationem . <end>$$<start> And though they refrained not from the emblems of the mourner , they sorrowed yet the more deeply in their hearts . <end>
<start> et quamquam neque insignibus lugentium abstinerent , altius animis maerebant . <end>$$<start> It chanced that some merchants who left Syria while Germanicus was still alive , brought more cheering tidings about his health . <end>
<start> forte negotiatores vivente adhuc Germanico Syria egressi laetiora de valetudine eius attulere . <end>$$<start> These were instantly believed , instantly published . <end>
<start> statim credita , statim vulgata sunt ut quisque obvius , quamvis leviter audita in alios atque illi in plures cumulata gaudio transferunt . <end>$$<start> Every one passed on to others whom he met the intelligence , ill-authenticated as it was , and they again to many more , with joyous exaggeration . <end>
<start> cursant per urbem , molinutur templorum foris . <end>$$<start> They ran to and fro through the city and broke open the doors of the temples . <end>
<start> iuvat credulitatem nox et promptior inter tenebras adfirmatio . <end>$$<start> Night assisted their credulity , and amid the darkness confident assertion was comparatively easy . <end>
<start> nec obstitit falsis Tiberius donec tempore ac spatio vanescerent et populus quasi rursum ereptum acrius doluit . <end>$$<start> Nor did Tiberius check the false reports till by lapse of time they died away . <end>
<start> Honores ut quis amore in Germanicum aut ingenio validus reperti decretique ut nomen eius Saliari carmine caneretur . <end>$$<start> And so the people grieved the more bitterly as though Germanicus was again lost to them . <end>
<start> sedes curules sacerdotum Augustalium locis superque eas querceae coronae statuerentur . <end>$$<start> New honours were devised and decreed , as men were inspired by affection for him or by genius . <end>
<start> ludos circensis eburna effigies praeiret neve quis flamen aut augur in locum Germanici nisi gentis Iuliae crearetur . <end>$$<start> His name was to be celebrated in the song of the Salii chairs of state with oaken garlands over them were to be set up in the places assigned to the priesthood of the Augustales . <end>
<start> arcus additi Romae et apud ripam Rheni et in monte Syriae Amano cum inscriptione rerum gestarum ac mortem ob rem publicam obisse . <end>$$<start> his image in ivory was to head the procession in the games of the circus . <end>
<start> sepulchrum Antiochiae ubi crematus , tribunal Epidaphnae quo in loco vitam finierat . <end>$$<start> no flamen or augur , except from the Julian family , was to be chosen in the room of Germanicus . <end>
<start> cum censeretur clipeus auro et magnitudine insignis inter auctores eloquentiae , adseveravit Tiberius solitum paremque ceteris dicaturum neque enim eloquentiam fortuna discerni et satis inlustre si veteres inter scriptores haberetur . <end>$$<start> The knights called the seats in the theatre known as the juniors , Germanicus's benches , and arranged that their squadrons were to ride in procession behind his effigy on the fifteenth of July . <end>
<start> pleraque manent quaedam statim omissa sunt aut vetustas oblitteravit . <end>$$<start> some were at once dropped , or became obsolete with time . <end>
<start> Ceterum recenti adhuc maestitia soror Germanici Livia , nupta Druso , duos virilis sexus simul enixa est . <end>$$<start> While men's sorrow was yet fresh , Germanicus's sister Livia , who was married to Drusus , gave birth to twin sons . <end>
<start> Eodem anno gravibus senatus decretis libido feminarum coercita cautumque ne quaestum corpore faceret cui avus aut pater aut maritus eques Romanus fuisset . <end>$$<start> That same year the profligacy of women was checked by stringent enactments , and it was provided that no woman whose grandfather , father , or husband had been a Roman knight should get money by prostitution . <end>
<start> nam Vistilia praetoria familia genita licentiam stupri apud aedilis vulgaverat , more inter veteres recepto , qui satis poenarum adversum impudicas in ipsa professione flagitii credebant . <end>$$<start> Vistilia , born of a praetorian family , had actually published her name with this object on the aedile's list , according to a recognised custom of our ancestors , who considered it a sufficient punishment on unchaste women to have to profess their shame . <end>
<start> exactum et a Titidio Labeone Vistiliae marito cur in uxore delicti manifesta ultionem legis omisisset . <end>$$<start> Titidius Labeo , Vistilia's husband , was judicially called on to say why with a wife whose guilt was manifest he had neglected to inflict the legal penalty . <end>
<start> atque illo praetendente sexaginta dies ad consultandum datos necdum praeterisse , satis visum de Vistilia statuere . <end>$$<start> When he pleaded that the sixty days given for deliberation had not yet expired , it was thought sufficient to decide Vistilia's case , and she was banished out of sight to the island of Seriphos . <end>
<start> eaque in insulam Seriphon abdita est actum et de sacris Aegyptiis Iudaicisque pellendis factumque patrum consultum ut quattuor milia libertini generis ea superstitione infecta quis idonea aetas in insulam Sardiniam veherentur , coercendis illic latrociniis et , si ob gravitatem caeli interissent , vile damnum . <end>$$<start> There was a debate too about expelling the Egyptian and Jewish worship , and a resolution of the Senate was passed that four thousand of the freedmen class who were infected with those superstitions and were of military age should be transported to the island of Sardinia , to quell the brigandage of the place , a cheap sacrifice should they die from the pestilential climate . <end>
<start> ceteri cederent Italia nisi certam ante diem profanos ritus exuissent . <end>$$<start> The rest were to quit Italy , unless before a certain day they repudiated their impious rites . <end>
<start> Post quae rettulit Caesar capiendam virginem in locum Occiae , quae septem et quinquaginta per annos summa sanctimonia Vestalibus sacris praesederat . <end>$$<start> Next the emperor brought forward a motion for the election of a Vestal virgin in the room of Occia , who for fifty-seven years had presided with the most immaculate virtue over the Vestal worship . <end>
<start> egitque grates Fonteio Agrippae et Domitio Pollioni quod offerendo filias de officio in rem publicam certarent . <end>$$<start> He formally thanked Fonteius Agrippa and Domitius Pollio for offering their daughters and so vying with one another in zeal for the commonwealth . <end>
<start> praelata est Pollionis filia , non ob aliud quam quod mater eius in eodem coniugio manebat . <end>$$<start> Pollio's daughter was preferred , only because her mother had lived with one and the same husband , while Agrippa had impaired the honour of his house by a divorce . <end>
<start> nam Agrippa discidio domum imminuerat et Caesar quamvis posthabitam decies sestertii dote solatus est . <end>$$<start> The emperor consoled his daughter , passed over though she was , with a dowry of a million sesterces . <end>
<start> Saevitiam annonae incusante plebe statuit frumento pretium quod emptor penderet , binosque nummos se additurum negotiatoribus in singulos modios . <end>$$<start> As the city populace complained of the cruel dearness of corn , he fixed a price for grain to be paid by the purchaser , promising himself to add two sesterces on every peck for the traders . <end>
<start> neque tamen ob ea parentis patriae delatum et antea vocabulum adsumpsit , acerbeque increpuit eos qui divinas occupationes ipsumque dominum dixerant . <end>$$<start> But he would not therefore accept the title of father of the country which once before too had been offered him , and he sharply rebuked those who called his work divine and himself lord . <end>
<start> unde angusta et lubrica oratio sub principe qui libertatem metuebat adulationem oderat . <end>$$<start> Consequently , speech was restricted and perilous under an emperor who feared freedom while he hated sycophancy . <end>
<start> Reperio apud scriptores senatoresque eorundem temporum Adgandestrii principis Chattorum lectas in senatu litteras , quibus mortem Arminii promittebat si patrandae neci venenum mitteretur , responsumque esse non fraude neque occultis , sed palam et armatum populum Romanum hostis suos ulcisci . <end>$$<start> I find it stated by some writers and senators of the period that a letter from Adgandestrius , chief of the Chatti , was read in the Senate , promising the death of Arminius , if poison were sent for the perpetration of the murder , and that the reply was that it was not by secret treachery but openly and by arms that the people of Rome avenged themselves on their enemies . <end>
<start> ceterum Arminius abscedentibus Romanis et pulso Maroboduo regnum adfectans libertatem popularium adversam habuit , petitusque armis cum varia fortuna certaret , dolo propinquorum cecidit liberator haud dubie Germaniae et qui non primordia populi Romani , sicut alii reges ducesque , sed florentissimum imperium lacessierit , proeliis ambiguus , bello non victus . <end>$$<start> Assuredly he was the deliverer of Germany , one too who had defied Rome , not in her early rise , as other kings and generals , but in the height of her empire's glory , had fought , indeed , indecisive battles , yet in war remained unconquered . <end>
<start> Nihil intermissa navigatione hiberni maris Agrippina Corcyram insulam advehitur , litora Calabriae contra sitam . <end>$$<start> WITHOUT pausing in her winter voyage Agrippina arrived at the island of Corcyra , facing the shores of Calabria . <end>
<start> interim adventu eius audito intimus quisque amicorum et plerique militares , ut quique sub Germanico stipendia fecerant , multique etiam ignoti vicinis e municipiis , pars officium in principem rati , plures illos secuti , ruere ad oppidum Brundisium , quod naviganti celerrimum fidissimumque adpulsu erat . <end>$$<start> As soon as the fleet was seen on the horizon , not only the harbour and the adjacent shores , but the city walls too and the roofs and every place which commanded the most distant prospect were filled with crowds of mourners , who incessantly asked one another , whether , when she landed , they were to receive her in silence or with some utterance of emotion . <end>
<start> atque ubi primum ex alto visa classis , complentur non modo portus et proxima maris sed moenia ac tecta , quaque longissime prospectari poterat , maerentium turba et rogitantium inter se silentione an voce aliqua egredientem exciperent . <end>$$<start> They were not agreed on what befitted the occasion when the fleet slowly approached , its crew , not joyous as is usual , but wearing all a studied expression of grief . <end>
<start> neque satis constabat quid pro tempore foret , cum classis paulatim successit , non alacri , ut adsolet , remigio sed cunctis ad tristitiam compositis . <end>$$<start> When Agrippina descended from the vessel with her two children , clasping the funeral urn , with eyes riveted to the earth , there was one universal groan . <end>
<start> postquam duobus cum liberis , feralem urnam tenens , egressa navi defixit oculos , idem omnium gemitus . <end>$$<start> You could not distinguish kinsfolk from strangers , or the laments of men from those of women . <end>
<start> Miserat duas pmetorias cohortis Caesar , addito ut magistratus Calabriae Apulique et Campani suprema erga memoriam filii sui munera fungerentur . <end>$$<start> The emperor had despatched two praetorian cohorts with instructions that the magistrates of Calabria , Apulia , and Campania were to pay the last honours to his son's memory . <end>
<start> igitur trlbunorum centurionumque umeris cineres portabantur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly tribunes and centurions bore Germanicus's ashes on their shoulders . <end>
<start> praecedebant incompta signa , versi fasces . <end>$$<start> They were preceded by the standards unadorned and the faces reversed . <end>
<start> atque ubi colonias transgrederentur , atrata plebes , trabeati equites pro opibus loci vestem odores aliaque funerum sollemnia cremabant . <end>$$<start> As they passed colony after colony , the populace in black , the knights in their state robes , burnt vestments and perfumes with other usual funeral adjuncts , in proportion to the wealth of the place . <end>
<start> etiam quorum diversa oppida , tamen obvii et victimas atque aras dis Manibus statuentes lacrimis et conclamationibus dolorem testabantur . <end>$$<start> Even those whose towns were out of the route , met the mourners , offered victims and built altars to the dead , testifying their grief by tears and wailings . <end>
<start> Drusus Tarracinam progressus est cum Claudio fratre liberisque Germanici , qui in urbe fuerant . <end>$$<start> Drusus went as far as Tarracina with Claudius , brother of Germanicus , and had been at Rome . <end>
<start> consules Marcus Valerius et Marcus Aurelius (iam enim magistratum occeperant et senatus ac magna pars populi viam complevere , dislecti et ut cuique libitum flentes . <end>$$<start> Marcus Valerius and Caius Aurelius , the consuls , who had already entered on office , and a great number of the people thronged the road in scattered groups , every one weeping as he felt inclined . <end>
<start> aberat quippe adulatio , gnaris omnibus laetam Tlberio Germanici mortem male dissimulari . <end>$$<start> Flattery there was none , for all knew that Tiberius could scarcely dissemble his joy at the death of Germanicus . <end>
<start> Tiberius atque Augusta publico abstinuere , inferius maiestate sua rati si palam lamentarentur , an ne omnium oculis vultum eorum scrutantibus falsi intellegerentur . <end>$$<start> Tiberius Augusta refrained from showing themselves , thinking it below their dignity to shed tears in public , or else fearing that , if all eyes scrutinised their faces , their hypocrisy would be revealed . <end>
<start> matrem Antoniam non apud auctores rerum , non diurna actorum scriptura reperio ullo insigni officio functam , cum super Agrippinam et Drusum et Claudium ceteri quoque consanguinei nominatim perscripti sint , seu valetudine praepediebatur seu victus luctu animus magnitudinem mali perferre visu non toleravit . <end>$$<start> She may either have been hindered by illness , or with a spirit overpowered by grief she may not have had the heart to endure the sight of so great an affliction . <end>
<start> Dies quo reliquiae tumulo Augusti inferebantur modo per silentium vastus , modo ploratibus inquies . <end>$$<start> The day on which the remains were consigned to the tomb of Augustus , was now desolate in its silence , now distracted by lamentations . <end>
<start> plena urbis itinera , conlucentes per campum Martis faces . <end>$$<start> The streets of the city were crowded . <end>
<start> illic miles cum armis , sine insignibus magistratus , populus per tribus concidisse rem publicam , nihil spei reliquum clamitabant , promptius apertiusque quam ut meminisse imperitantium crederes . <end>$$<start> torches were blazing throughout the Campus Martius There the soldiers under arms , the magistrates without their symbols of office , the people in the tribes , were all incessantly exclaiming that the commonwealth was ruined , that not a hope remained , too boldly and openly to let one think that they remembered their rulers . <end>
<start> nihil tamen Tiberium magis penetravit quam studia hominum accensa in Agrippinam , cum decus patriae , solum Augusti sanguinem , unicum antiquitatis specimen appellarent versique ad caelum ac deos integram illi subolem ac superstitem iniquorum precarentur . <end>$$<start> But nothing impressed Tiberius more deeply than the enthusiasm kindled in favor of Agrippina , whom men spoke of as the glory of the country , the sole surviving off spring of Augustus , the solitary example of the old times , while looking up to heaven and the gods they prayed for the safety of her children and that they might outlive their oppressors . <end>
<start> Fuere qui publici funeris pompam requirerent compararentque quae in Drusum patrem Germanici honora et magnifica Augustus fecisset . <end>$$<start> Some there were who missed the grandeur of a state-funeral , and contrasted the splendid honours conferred by Augustus on Drusus , the father of Germanicus . <end>
<start> ipsum quippe asperrimo hiemis Ticinum usque progressum neque abscedentem a corpore simul urbem intravisse . <end>$$<start> Then the emperor himself , they said , went in the extreme rigour of winter as far as Ticinum , and never leaving the corpse entered Rome with it . <end>
<start> circumfusas lecto Claudiorum Iuliorumque imagines . <end>$$<start> Round the funeral bier were ranged the images of the Claudii and the Julii . <end>
<start> defletum in foro , laudatum pro rostris , cuncta a maioribus reperta aut quae posteri invenerint cumulata at Germanico ne solitos quidem et cuicumque nobili debitos honores contigisse . <end>$$<start> there was weeping in the forum , and a panegyric before the rostra every honour devised by our ancestors or invented by their descendants was heaped on him . <end>
<start> sane corpus ob longinquitatem itinerum externis terris quoquo modo crematum sed tanto plura decora mox tribui par fuisse quanto prima fors negavisset . <end>$$<start> But as for Germanicus , even the customary distinctions due to any noble had not fallen to his lot . <end>
<start> ubi illa veterum instituta , propositam toro effigiem , meditata ad memoriam virtutis carmina et laudationes et lacrimas vel doloris imitamenta . <end>$$<start> Where were all those usages of the past , the image at the head of the bier , the lays composed in commemoration of worth , the eulogies and laments , or at least the semblance of grief . <end>
<start> utque premeret vulgi sermones , monuit edicto multos inlustrium Romanorum ob rem publicam obisse , neminem tam flagranti desiderio celebratum . <end>$$<start> This regret was a glory both to himself and to all , provided only a due mean were observed . <end>
<start> non enim eadem decora principibus viris et imperatori popolo quae modicis domibus aut civitatibus . <end>$$<start> Tears and the solace found in mourning were suitable enough for the first burst of grief . <end>
<start> sed referendum iam animum ad firmitudinem , ut quondam divus Iulius amissa unica filia , ut divus Augustus ereptis nepotibus abstruserint tristitiam . <end>$$<start> There was no need of examples from the past , showing how often the Roman people had patiently endured the defeats of armies , the destruction of generals , the total extinction of noble families . <end>
<start> principes mortalis , rem publicam aeternam esse . <end>$$<start> the State was everlasting . <end>
<start> proin repeterent sollemnia , et quia ludorum Megalesium spectaculum suberat , etiam voluptates resumerent . <end>$$<start> Let them then return to their usual pursuits , and , as the shows of the festival of the Great Goddess were at hand , even resume their amusements . <end>
<start> Tum exuto iustitio reditum ad munia , et Drusus Illyricos ad exercitus profectus est , erectis omnium animis petendae e Pisone ultionis et crebro questu , quod vagus interim per amoena Asiae atque Achaiae adroganti et subdola mora scelerum probationes subverteret . <end>$$<start> The suspension of business then ceased , and men went back to their occupations Drusus was sent to the armies of Illyricum , amidst an universal eagerness to exact vengeance on Piso , and ceaseless complaints that he was meantime roaming through the delightful regions of Asia and Achaia , and was weakening the proofs of his guilt by an insolent and artful procrastination . <end>
<start> At Piso praemisso in urbem filio datisque mandatis per quae principem molliret ad Drusum pergit , quem haud fratris interitu trucem quam remoto aemulo acquiorem sibi sperabat . <end>$$<start> Piso meanwhile sent his son on to Rome with a message intended to pacify the emporer , and then made his way to Drusus , who would , he hoped , be not so much infuriated at his brother's death as kindly disposed towards himself in consequence of a rival's removal . <end>
<start> Tiberius quo integrum iudicium ostentaret , exceptum comiter iuvenem sueta erga filios familiarum nobilis liberalitate auget . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , to show his impartiality , received the youth courteously , and enriched him with the liberality he usually bestowed on the sons of noble families . <end>
<start> Drusus Pisoni , si vera forent quae iacerentur , praecipuum in dolore suum locum respondit sed malle falsa et inania nec cuiquam mortem Germanici exitiosam esse . <end>$$<start> Drusus replied to Piso that if certain insinuations were true , he must be foremost in his resentment , but he preferred to believe that they were false and groundless , and that Germanicus's death need be the ruin of no one . <end>
<start> haec palam et vitato omni secreto . <end>$$<start> This he said openly , avoiding anything like secrecy . <end>
<start> neque dubitabantur praescripta ei a Tiberio , cum incallidus alioqui et facilis iuventa senilibus tum artibus uteretur . <end>$$<start> Men did not doubt that his answer prescribed him by Tiberius , inasmuch as one who had generally all the simplicity and candour of youth , now had recourse to the artifices of old age . <end>
<start> Piso Delmatico mari tramisso relictisque apud Anconam navibus per Picenum ac mox Flaminiam viam adsequitur legionem , quae e Pannonia in urbem , dein praesidio Africae ducebatur eaque res agitata rumoribus ut in agmine atque itinere crebro se militibus ostentavisset . <end>$$<start> Piso , after crossing the Dalmatian sea and leaving his ships at Ancona , went through Picenum and along the Flaminian road , where he overtook a legion which was marching from Pannonia to Rome and was then to garrison Africa . <end>
<start> ab Narnia , vitandae suspicionis an quia pavidis consilia in incerto sunt , Nare ac mox Tiberi devectus auxit vulgi iras , quia navem tumulo Caesarum adpulerat dieque et ripa frequenti , magno clientium agmine ipse , feminarum comitatu Plancina et vultu alacres incessere . <end>$$<start> In broad daylight , when the river-bank was thronged , he himself with a numerous following of dependents , and Plancina with a retinue of women , moved onward with joy in their countenances . <end>
<start> Postera die Fuleinius Trio Pisonem apud consules postulavit . <end>$$<start> Next day , Fulcinius Trio asked the consul's leave to prosecute Piso . <end>
<start> ille dimissa eius causae delatione , ut priorem vitam accusaret obtinuit , petitumque est a principe cognitionem exciperet . <end>$$<start> This even the accused did not refuse , fearing , as he did , the bias of the people and of the Senate . <end>
<start> quod ne reus quidem abnuebat , studia populi et patrum metuens contra Tiberium spernendis rumoribus validum et conscientiae matris innexum esse . <end>$$<start> while Tiberius , he knew , was resolute enough to despise report , and was also entangled in his mother's complicity . <end>
<start> veraque aut in deterius credita indice ab uno facilius discerni , odium et invidiam apud multos valere . <end>$$<start> Truth too would be more easily distinguished from perverse misrepresentation by a single judge , where a number would be swayed by hatred and ill-will . <end>
<start> haud fallebat Tiberium moles cognitionis quaque ipse fama distraheretur . <end>$$<start> Tiberius was not unaware of the formidable difficulty of the inquiry and of the rumours by which he was himself assailed . <end>
<start> igitur paucis familiarium adhibitis minas accusantium et hinc preces audit integramque causam ad senatum remittit . <end>$$<start> Having therefore summoned a few intimate friends , he listened to the threatening speeches of the prosecutors and to the pleadings of the accused , and finally referred the whole case to the Senate . <end>
<start> Atque interim Drusus rediens Illyrico , quamquam patres censuissent ob receptum Maroboduum et res priore aestate gestas ut ovans iniret , prolato honore urbem intravit . <end>$$<start> Drusus meanwhile , on his return from Illyricum , though the Senate had voted him an ovation for the submission of Maroboduus and the successes of the previous summer , postponed the honour and entered Rome . <end>
<start> post quae reo Lucius Arruntium , Publius Vinicium , Asinium Gallum , Aeserninum Marcellum , Sex Pompeium patronos petenti iisque diversa excusantibus M Lepidus et Lucius Piso et Livineius Regulus adfuere , arrecta omni civitate , quanta fides amicis Germanici , quae fiducia reo . <end>$$<start> Then the defendant sought the advocacy of Lucius Arruntius , Marcus Vinicius , Asinius Gallus , Aeserninus Marcellus and Sextus Pompeius , and on their declining for different reasons , Marcus Lepidus , Lucius Piso , and Livineius Regulus became his counsel , amid the excitement of the whole country , which wondered how much fidelity would be shown by the friends of Germanicus , on what the accused rested his hopes , and how far Tiberius would repress and hide his feelings . <end>
<start> satin cohiberet ac premeret sensus suos Tiberius . <end>$$<start> Never were the people more keenly interested . <end>
<start> haud alias intentior populus plus sibi in principem occultae vocis aut suspicacis silentii permisit . <end>$$<start> never did they indulge themselves more freely in secret whispers against the emperor or in the silence of suspicion . <end>
<start> Die senatus Caesar orationem habuit meditato temperamento . <end>$$<start> On the day the Senate met , Tiberius delivered a speech of studied moderation . <end>
<start> patris sui legatum atque amicum Pisonem fuisse adiutoremque Germanico datum a se auctore senatu rebus apud Orientem administrandis . <end>$$<start> Whether he there had provoked the young prince by wilful opposition and rivalry , and had rejoiced at his death or wickedly destroyed him , is for you to determine with minds unbiassed . <end>
<start> nam si legatus officii terminos , obsequium erga imperatorem exuit eiusdemque morte et luctu meo laetatus est , odero seponamque a domo mea et privatas inimicitias non vi principis ulciscar sin facinus in cuiuscumque mortalium nece vindicandum detegitur , vos vero et liberos Germanici et nos parentes iustis solaciis adficite . <end>$$<start> For my part , I sorrow for my son and shall always sorrow for him still I would not hinder the accused from producing all the evidence which can relieve his innocence or convict Germanicus of any unfairness , if such there was . <end>
<start> simulque illud reputate , turbide et seditiose tractaverit exercitus Piso , quaesita sint per ambitionem studia militum , armis repetita provincia , an falsa haec in maius vulgaverint accusatores , quorum ego nimiis studiis iure suscenseo . <end>$$<start> And I implore you not to take as proven charges alleged , merely because the case is intimately bound up with my affliction . <end>
<start> si quos propinquus sanguis aut fides sua patronos dedit , quantum quisque eloquentia et cura valet , iuvate periclitantem ad eundem laborem , eandem constantiam accusatores hortor . <end>$$<start> In this , and in this only , will we place Germanicus above the laws , by conducting the inquiry into his death in this house instead of in the forum , and before the Senate instead of before a bench of judges . <end>
<start> nemo Drusi lacrimas , nemo maestitiam meam spectet , nec si qua in nos adversa finguntur . <end>$$<start> Let no one heed the tears of Drusus or my own sorrow , or any stories invented to our discredit . <end>
<start> Exim biduum criminibus obiciendis statuitur utque sex dierum spatio interiecto reus per triduum defenderetur . <end>$$<start> Two days were then assigned for the bringing forward of the charges , and after six days' interval , the prisoner's defence was to occupy three days . <end>
<start> tum Fulcinius vetera et inania orditur , ambitiose avareque habitam Hispaniam . <end>$$<start> Thereupon Fulcinius Trio began with some old and irrelevant accusations about intrigues and extortion during Piso's government of Spain . <end>
<start> quod neque convictum noxae reo si recentia purgaret , neque defensum absolutioni erat si teneretur maioribus flagitiis . <end>$$<start> This , if proved , would not have been fatal to the defendant , if he cleared himself as to his late conduct , and , if refuted , would not have secured his acquittal , if he were convicted of the greater crimes . <end>
<start> post quem Servaeus et Veranius et Vitellius consimili studio et multa eloquentia Vitellius obiecere odio Germanici et rerum novarum studio Pisonem vulgus militum per licentiam et sociorum iniurias eo usque conrupisse ut parens legionum a deterrimis appellaretur . <end>$$<start> Next , Servaeus , Veranius , and Vitellius , all with equal earnestness , Vitellius with striking eloquence , alleged against Piso that out of hatred of Germanicus and a desire of revolution he had so corrupted the common soldiers by licence and oppression of the allies that he was called by the vilest of them father of the legions while on the other hand to all the best men , especially to the companions and friends of Germanicus , he had been savagely cruel . <end>
<start> contra in optimum quemque , maxime in comites et amicos Germanici saevisse postremo ipsum devotionibus et veneno peremisse . <end>$$<start> Lastly , he had , they said , destroyed Germanicus himself by sorceries and poison , and hence came those ceremonies and horrible sacrifices made by himself and Plancina . <end>
<start> sacra hinc et immolationes nefandas ipsius atque Plancinae , peritam armis rem publicam , utque reus agi posset , acie victum . <end>$$<start> then he had threatened the State with war , and had been defeated in battle , before he could be tried as a prisoner . <end>
<start> Defensio in ceteris trepidavit . <end>$$<start> On all points but one the defence broke down . <end>
<start> nam neque ambitionem militarem neque provinciam pessimo cuique obnoxiam , ne contumelias quidem adversum imperatorem infitiari poterat solum veneni crimen visus est diluisse , quod ne accusatores quidem satis firmabant , in convivio Germanici , cum super eum Piso discumberet , infectos manibus eius cibos arguentes . <end>$$<start> That he had tampered with the soldiers , that his province had been at the mercy of the vilest of them , that he had even insulted his chief , he could not deny . <end>
<start> quippe absurdum videbatur inter aliena servitia et tot adstantium visu , ipso Germanico coram , id ausum . <end>$$<start> It was only the charge of poisoning from which he seemed to have cleared himself . <end>
<start> sed iudices per diversa implacabiles erant , Caesar ob bellum provinciae inlatum , senatus numquam satis credito sine fraude Germanicum interisse . <end>$$<start> And , besides , the defendant offered his slaves to the torture , and insisted on its application to the attendants on that occasion . <end>
<start> simul populi ante curiam voces audiebantur non temperaturos manibus si patrum sententias evasisset . <end>$$<start> At the same time shouts were heard from the people in front of the Senate House , threatening violence if he escaped the verdict of the Senators . <end>
<start> effigiesque Pisonis traxerant in Gemonias ac divellebant , ni iussu principis protectae repositaeque forent . <end>$$<start> They had actually dragged Piso's statues to the Gemonian stairs , and were breaking them in pieces , when by the emperor's order they were rescued and replaced . <end>
<start> igitur inditus lecticae et a tribuno praetoriae cohortis deductus est vario rumore custos saluti an mortis exactor sequeretur . <end>$$<start> Piso was then put in a litter and attended by a tribune of one of the Praetorian cohorts , who followed him , so it was variously rumoured , to guard his person or to be his executioner . <end>
<start> Eadem Plancinae invidia , maior gratia . <end>$$<start> Plancina was equally detested , but had stronger interest . <end>
<start> eoque ambiguum habebatur quantum Caesari in eam liceret . <end>$$<start> Consequently it was considered a question how far the emperor would be allowed to go against her . <end>
<start> atque ipsa , donec mediae Pisoni spes , sociam se cuiuscumque fortunae et si ita ferret comitem exitii promittebat ut secretis Augustae precibus veniam obtinuit , paulatim segregari a marito , dividere defensionem coepit . <end>$$<start> While Piso's hopes were in suspense , she offered to share his lot , whatever it might be , and in the worst event , to be his companion in death . <end>
<start> quod reus postquam sibi exitiabile intellegit , an adhuc experiretur dubitans , hortantibus filiis durat mentem senatumque rursum ingreditur . <end>$$<start> But as soon as she had secured her pardon through the secret intercessions of Augusta , she gradually withdrew from her husband and separated her defence from his . <end>
<start> redintegratamque accusationem , infensas patrum voces , adversa et saeva cuncta perpessus , nullo magis exterritus est quam quod Tiberium sine miseratione , sine ira , obstinatum clausumque vidit , ne quo adfectu perrumperetur . <end>$$<start> When the prisoner saw that this was fatal to him , he hesitated whether he should still persist , but at the urgent request of his sons braced his courage and once more entered the Senate . <end>
<start> dein multam post noctem , egressa cubiculo uxore , operiri foris iussit . <end>$$<start> Then he bestowed the usual attention on his person . <end>
<start> Audire me memini ex senioribus visum saepius inter manus Pisonis libellum quem ipse non vulgaverit sed amicos eius dictitavisse , litteras Tiberii et mandata in Germanicum contineri , ac destinatum promere apud patres principemque arguere , ni elusus a Seiano per vana promissa foret . <end>$$<start> I remember to have heard old men say that a document was often seen in Piso's hands , the substance of which he never himself divulged , but which his friends repeatedly declared contained a letter from Tiberius with instructions referring to Germanicus , and that it was his intention to produce it before the Senate and upbraid the emperor , had he not been deluded by vain promises from Sejanus . <end>
<start> nec illum sponte extinctum verum immisso percussore . <end>$$<start> Nor did he perish , they said , by his own hand , but by that of one sent to be his executioner . <end>
<start> quorum neutrum adseveraverim neque tamen occulere debui narratum ab iis qui nostram ad iuventam duraverunt . <end>$$<start> Neither of these statements would I positively affirm . <end>
<start> Caesar flexo in maestitiam ore suam invidiam tali morte quaesitam apud senatum  . <end>$$<start> still it would not have been right for me to conceal what was related by those who lived up to the time of my youth . <end>
<start> crebrisque interrogationibus exquirit qualem Piso diem supremum noctemque exegisset atque illo pleraque sapienter quaedam inconsultius respondente , recitat codicillos a Pisone in hunc ferme modum compositos conspiratione inimicorum et invidia falsi criminis oppressus , quatenus veritati et innocentiae meae nusquam locus est , deos inmortalis testor vixisse me , Caesar , cum fide adversum te neque alia in matrem tuam pietate . <end>$$<start> The emperor , assuming an air of sadness , complained in the Senate that the purpose of such a death was to bring odium on himself , and he asked with repeated questionings how Piso had spent his last day and night . <end>
<start> per quinque et quadraginta annorum obsequium , per collegium consulatus quondam divo Augusto parenti tuo probatus et tibi amicus nec quicquam post haec rogaturus salutem infelicis filii rogo . <end>$$<start> By forty-five years of obedience , by my association with you in the consulate , as one who formerly won the esteem of the Divine Augustus , your father , as one who is your friend and will never hereafter ask a favour , I implore you to save my unhappy son . <end>
<start> de Plancina nihil addidit . <end>$$<start> About Plancina he added not a word . <end>
<start> Post quae Tiberius adulescentem crimine civilis belli purgavit , patris quippe iussa nec potuisse filium detrectare , simul nobilitatem domus , etiam ipsius quoquo modo meriti gravem cacum miseratus . <end>$$<start> Tiberius after this acquitted the young Piso of the charge of civil war on the ground that a son could not have refused a father's orders , compassionating at the same time the high rank of the family and the terrible downfall even of Piso himself , however he might have deserved it . <end>
<start> pro Plancina cum pudore et flagitio disseruit , matris preces obtendens , in quam optimi cuiusque secreti questus magis ardescebant . <end>$$<start> For Plancina he spoke with shame and conscious disgrace , alleging in excuse the intercession of his mother , secret complaints against whom from all good men were growing more and more vehement . <end>
<start> id ergo fas aviae interfectricem nepotis adspicere , adloqui , eripere senatui . <end>$$<start> So it was the duty of a grandmother , people said , to look a grandson's murderess in the face , to converse with her and rescue her from the Senate . <end>
<start> quod pro omnibus civibus leges obtineant uni Germanico non contigisse . <end>$$<start> What the laws secure on behalf of every citizen , had to Germanicus alone been denied . <end>
<start> Vitellii et Veranii voce defletum Caesarem , ab imperatore et Augusta defensam Plancinam . <end>$$<start> The voices of a Vitellius and Veranius had bewailed a Caesar , while the emperor and Augusta had defended Plancina . <end>
<start> proinde venena et artes tam feliciter expertas verteret in Agrippinam , in liberos eius , egregiamque aviam ac patruum sanguine miserrimae domus exsatiaret . <end>$$<start> She might as well now turn her poisonings , and her devices which had proved so successful , against Agrippina and her children , and thus sate this exemplary grandmother and uncle with the blood of a most unhappy house . <end>
<start> biduum super hac imagine cognitionis absumptum urgente Tiberio liberos Pisonis matrem uti tuerentur . <end>$$<start> Two days were frittered away over this mockery of a trial , Tiberius urging Piso's children to defend their mother . <end>
<start> et cum accusatores ac testes certatim perorarent respondente nullo , miseratio quam invidia augebatur . <end>$$<start> While the accusers and their witnesses pressed the prosecution with rival zeal , and there was no reply , pity rather than anger was on the increase . <end>
<start> primus sententiam rogatus Aurelius Cotta consul (nam referente Caesare magistratus eo etiam munere fungebantur) nomen Pisonis radendum fastis censuit , partem bonorum publicandam , pars ut Gnaeus Pisoni filio concederetur isque praenomen mutaret . <end>$$<start> Aurelius Cotta , the consul , who was first called on for his vote (for when the emperor put the question , even those in office went through the duty of voting) , held that Piso's name ought to be erased from the public register , half of his property confiscated , half given up to his son , Cneius Piso , who was to change his first name . <end>
<start> Marcus Piso exuta dignitate et accepto quinquagies sestertio in decem annos relegaretur , concessa Plancinae incolumitate ob preces Augustae . <end>$$<start> that Marcus Piso , stript of his rank , with an allowance of five million sesterces , should be banished for ten years , Plancina's life being spared in consideration of Augusta's intercession . <end>
<start> Multa ex ea sententia mitigata sunt a principe ne nomen Pisonis fastis eximeretur , quando Marcus Antonii quid bellum patriae fecisset , Iulli Antonii qui domum Augusti violasset , manerent . <end>$$<start> Much of the sentence was mitigated by the emperor The name of Piso was not to be struck out of the public register , since that of Marcus Antonius who had made war on his country , and that of Julius Antonius who had dishonoured the house of Augustus , still remained . <end>
<start> et Marcus Pisonem ignominiae exemit concessitque ei paterna bona , satis firmus , ut saepe memoravi , adversum pecuniam et tum pudore absolutae Plancinae placabilior . <end>$$<start> Marcus Piso too he saved from degradation , and gave him his father's property , for he was firm enough , as I have often related , against the temptation of money , and now for very shame at Plancina's acquittal , he was more than usually merciful . <end>
<start> atque idem , cum Valerius Messalinus signum aureum in aede Martis Vltoris , Caecina Severus aram ultioni statuendam censuissent , prohibuit , ob externas ea victorias sacrari dictitans , domestica mala tristitia operienda . <end>$$<start> Again , when Valerius Messalinus and Caecina Severus proposed respectively the erection of a golden statue in the temple of Mars the Avenger and of an altar to Vengeance , he interposed , protesting that victories over the foreigner were commemorated with such monuments , but that domestic woes ought to be shrouded in silent grief . <end>
<start> addiderat Messalinus Tiberio et Augustae et Antoniae et Agrippinae Drusoque ob vindictam Germanici gratis agendas omiseratque Claudii mentionem . <end>$$<start> There was a further proposal of Messalinus , that Tiberius , Augusta , Antonia , Agrippina and Drusus ought to be publicly thanked for having avenged Germanicus . <end>
<start> mihi quanto plura recentium seu veterum revolvo tanto magis ludibria rerum mortalium cunctis in negotiis obversantur . <end>$$<start> For my part , the wider the scope of my reflection on the present and the past , the more am I impressed by their mockery of human plans in every transaction . <end>
<start> quippe fama spe veneratione potius omnes destinabantur imperio quam quem futurum principem fortuna in occulto tenebat . <end>$$<start> Clearly , the very last man marked out for empire by public opinion , expectation and general respect was he whom fortune was holding in reserve as the emperor of the future . <end>
<start> Paucis post diebus Caesar auctor senatui fuit Vitellio atque Veranio et Servaeo sacerdotia tribuendi Fulcinio suffragium ad honores pollicitus monuit ne facundiam violentia praecipitaret . <end>$$<start> A few days afterwards the emperor proposed to the Senate to confer the priesthood on Vitellius , Veranius and Servaeus . <end>
<start> is finis fuit ulciscenda Germanici morte , non modo apud illos homines qui tum agebant etiam secutis temporibus vario rumore iactata . <end>$$<start> To Fulcinius he promised his support in seeking promotion , but warned him not to ruin his eloquence by rancour . <end>
<start> adeo maxima quaeque ambigua sunt , dum alii quoquo modo audita pro compertis habent , alii vera in contrarium vertunt , et gliscit utrumque posteritate . <end>$$<start> This was the end of avenging the death of Germanicus , a subject of conflicting rumours not only among the people then living but also in after times . <end>
<start> paucosque post dies Vipsania mater eius excessit , una omnium Agrippae liberorum miti obitu nam ceteros manifestum ferro vel creditum est veneno aut fame extinctos . <end>$$<start> As for the rest , they perished , some it is certain by the sword , others it was believed by poison or starvation . <end>
<start> Eodem anno Tacfarinas , quem priore aestate pulsum a Camillo memoravi , bellum in Africa renovat , vagis primum populationibus et ob pernicitatem inultis , dein vicos excindere , trahere gravis praedas . <end>$$<start> That same year Tacfarinas who had been defeated , as I have related , by Camillus in the previous summer , renewed hostilities in Africa , first by mere desultory raids , so swift as to be unpunished . <end>
<start> postremo haud procul Pagyda flumine cohortem Romanam circumsedit . <end>$$<start> Finally , he hemmed in a Roman cohort near the river Pagyda . <end>
<start> praeerat castello Decrius impiger manu , exercitus militia et illam obsidionem flagitii ratus . <end>$$<start> The position was commanded by Decrius , a soldier energetic in action and experienced in war , who regarded the siege as a disgrace . <end>
<start> is cohortatus milites , ut copiam pugnae in aperto faceret aciem pro castris instruit . <end>$$<start> Cheering on his men to offer battle in the open plain , he drew up his line in front of his intrenchments . <end>
<start> primoque impetu pulsa cohorte promptus inter tela occursat fugientibus , increpat signiferos quod inconditis aut desertoribus miles Romanus terga daret . <end>$$<start> At the first shock , the cohort was driven back , upon which he threw himself fearlessly amid the missiles in the path of the fugitives and cried shame on the standard-bearers for letting Roman soldiers show their backs to a rabble of deserters . <end>
<start> Quae postquam Lucius Apronio (nam Camillo successerat) comperta , magis dedecore suorum quam gloria hostis anxius , raro ea tempestate et e vetere memoria facinore decumum quemque ignominiosae cohortis sorte ductos fusti necat . <end>$$<start> On receiving this information , Lucius Apronius , successor to Camillus , alarmed more by the dishonour of his own men than by the glory of the enemy , ventured on a deed quite exceptional at that time and derived from old tradition . <end>
<start> tantumque severitate profectum ut vexillum veteranorum , non amplius quingenti numero , easdem Tacfarinatis copias praesidium cui Thala nomen adgressas fuderint . <end>$$<start> He flogged to death every tenth man drawn by lot from the disgraced cohort So beneficial was this rigour that a detachment of veterans , numbering not more than five hundred , routed those same troops of Tacfarinas on their attacking a fortress named Thala . <end>
<start> quo proelio Rufus Helvius gregarius miles servati civis decus rettulit donatusque est ab Apronio torquibus et hasta . <end>$$<start> In this engagement Rufus Helvius , a common soldier , won the honour of saving a citizen's life , and was rewarded by Apronius with a neck-chain and a spear . <end>
<start> Caesar addidit civicam coronam , quod non eam quoque Apronius iure proconsulis tribuisset questus magis quam offensus . <end>$$<start> To these the emperor added the civic crown , complaining , but without anger , that Apronius had not used his right as proconsul to bestow this further distinction . <end>
<start> sed Tacfarinas perculsis Numidis et obsidia aspernantibus spargit bellum , ubi instaretur cedens ac rursum in terga remeans . <end>$$<start> Tacfarinas , however , finding that the Numidians were cowed and had a horror of siege-operations , pursued a desultory warfare , retreating when he was pressed , and then again hanging on his enemy's rear . <end>
<start> et dum ea ratio barbaro fuit , inritum fessumque Romanum impune ludificabatur postquam deflexit ad maritimos locos , inligatus praeda stativis castris adhaerebat , missu patris Apronius Caesianus cum equite et cohortibus auxiliariis , quis velocissimos legionum addiderat , prosperam adversum Numidas pugnam facit pellitque in deserta . <end>$$<start> While the barbarian continued these tactics , he could safely insult the baffled and exhausted Romans But when he marched away towards the coast and , hampered with booty , fixed himself in a regular camp , Caesianus was despatched by his father Apronius with some cavalry and auxiliary infantry , reinforced by the most active of the legionaries , and , after a successful battle with the Numidians , drove them into the desert . <end>
<start> At Romae Lepida , cui super Aemiliorum decus Lucius Sulla et Gnaeus Pompeius proavi erant , defertur simulavisse partum ex Publius Quirinio divite atque orbo . <end>$$<start> At Rome meanwhile Lepida , who beside the glory of being one of the Aemilii was the great-granddaughter of Lucius Sulla and Cneius Pompeius , was accused of pretending to be a mother by Publius Quirinus , a rich and childless man . <end>
<start> adiciebantur adulteria venena quaesitumque per Chaldaeos in domum Caesaris , defendente ream Manio Lepido fratre . <end>$$<start> Then , too , there were charges of adulteries , of poisonings , and of inquiries made through astrologers concerning the imperial house . <end>
<start> Quirinius post dictum repudium ad huc infensus quamvis infami ac nocenti miserationem addiderat . <end>$$<start> The accused was defended by her brother Manius Lepidus . <end>
<start> haud facile quis dispexerit illa in cognitione mentem principis adeo vertit ac miscuit irae et clementiae signa . <end>$$<start> Quirinus by his relentless enmity even after his divorce , had procured for her some sympathy , infamous and guilty as she was . <end>
<start> deprecatus primo senatum ne maiestatis crimina tractarentur , mox Marcus Servilium e consularibus aliosque testis inlexit ad proferenda quae velut reicere voluerat . <end>$$<start> One could not easily perceive the emperor's feelings at her trial so effectually did he interchange and blend the outward signs of resentment and compassion . <end>
<start> idemque servos Lepidae , cum militari custodia haberentur , transtulit ad consules neque per tormenta interrogari passus est de iis quae ad domum suam pertinerent . <end>$$<start> He first begged the Senate not to deal with the charges of treason , and subsequently induced Marcus Servilius , an ex-consul , to divulge what he had seemingly wished to suppress . <end>
<start> quod alii civile rebantur , ne ceteris adsentiendi necessitas fieret , quidam ad saevitiam trahebant neque enim cessurum nisi damnandi officio . <end>$$<start> Some thought this a gracious act , done to save the rest of the Senators from a compulsory assent , while others ascribed it to malignity , on the ground that he would have yielded only where there was a necessity of condemning . <end>
<start> Lepida ludorum diebus qui cognitionem intervenerant theatrum cum claris feminis ingressa , lamentatione flebili maiores suos ciens ipsumque Pompeium , cuius ea monimenta et adstantes imagines visebantur , tantum misericordiae permovit ut effusi in lacrimas saeva et detestanda Quirinio clamitarent , cuius senectae atque orbitati et obscurissimae domui destinata quondam uxor Lucius Caesari ac divo Augusto nurus dederetur . <end>$$<start> On the days of the games which interrupted the trial , Lepida went into the theatre with some ladies of rank , and as she appealed with piteous wailings to her ancestors and to that very Pompey , the public buildings and statues of whom stood there before their eyes , she roused such sympathy that people burst into tears and shouted , without ceasing , savage curses on Quirinus , to whose childless old-age and miserably obscure family , one once destined to be the wife of Lucius Caesar and the daughter-in-law of the Divine Augustus was being sacrificed . <end>
<start> dein tormentis servorum patefacta sunt flagitia itumque in sententiam Rubelli Blandi a quo aqua atque igni arcebatur . <end>$$<start> Then , by the torture of the slaves , her infamies were brought to light , and a motion of Rubellius Blandus was carried which outlawed her . <end>
<start> huic Drusus adsensit quamquam alii mitius censuissent . <end>$$<start> Drusus supported him , though others had proposed a milder sentence . <end>
<start> mox Scauro , qui filiam ex ea genuerat , datum ne bona publicarentur . <end>$$<start> Subsequently , Scaurus , who had had daughter by her , obtained as a concession that her property should not be confiscated . <end>
<start> tum demum aperuit Tiberius compertum sibi etiam ex Publius Quirinii servis veneno eum a Lepida petitum . <end>$$<start> Then at last Tiberius declared that he had himself too ascertained from the slaves of Publius Quirinus that Lepida had attempted their master's life by poison . <end>
<start> Inlustrium domuum adversa (etenim haud multum distanti tempore Calpurnii Pisonem , Aemilii Lepidam amiserant) solacio adfecit D . <end>$$<start> It was some compensation for the misfortunes of great houses (for within a short interval the Calpurnii had lost Piso and the Aemilii Lepida) that Decimus Silanus was now restored to the Junian family . <end>
<start> Silanus Iuniae familiae redditus . <end>$$<start> I will briefly relate his downfall . <end>
<start> ut valida divo Augusto in rem publicam fortuna ita domi improspera fuit ob impudicitiam filiae ac neptis quas urbe depulit , adulterosque earum morte aut fuga punivit . <end>$$<start> Calling , as he did , a vice so habitual among men and women by the awful name of sacrilege and treason , he went far beyond the indulgent spirit of our ancestors , beyond indeed his own legislation . <end>
<start> nam culpam inter viros ac feminas vulgatam gravi nomine laesarum religionum ac violatae maiestatis appellando clementiam maiorum suasque ipse leges egrediebatur . <end>$$<start> But I will relate the deaths of others with the remaining events of that time , if after finishing the work I have now proposed to myself , I prolong my life for further labours . <end>
<start> sed aliorum exitus simul cetera illius aetatis memorabo si effectis in quae tetendi plures ad curas vitam produxero . <end>$$<start> Decimus Silanus , the paramour of the granddaughter of Augustus , though the only severity he experienced was exclusion from the emperor's friendship , saw clearly that it meant exile . <end>
<start> Silanus in nepti Augusti adulter , quamquam non ultra foret saevitum quam ut amicitia Caesaris Tiberio imperitante deprecari senatum ac principem ausus est Marcus Silani fratris potentia , qui per insignem nobilitatem et eloquentiam praecellebat . <end>$$<start> But Tiberius , when Silanus thanked him , replied in the Senate's presence , that he too rejoiced at the brother's return from his long foreign tour , and that this was justly allowable , inasmuch as he had been banished not by a decree of the Senate or under any law . <end>
<start> sed Tiberius gratis agenti Silano patribus coram respondit se quoque laetari quod frater eius e peregrinatione longinqua revertisset , idque iure licitum quia non senatus consulto non lege pulsus foret sibi tamen adversus eum integras parentis sui offensiones neque reditu Silani dissoluta quae Augustus voluisset . <end>$$<start> Still , personally , he said , he felt towards him his father's resentment in all its force , and the return of Silanus had not cancelled the intentions of Augustus . <end>
<start> fuit posthac in urbe eque honores adeptus est . <end>$$<start> Silanus after this lived at Rome without attaining office . <end>
<start> Relatum dein de moderanda Papia Poppaea , quam senior Augustus post Iulias rogationes incitandis caelibum poenis et augendo aerario sanxerat . <end>$$<start> It was next proposed to relax the Papia Poppaea law , which Augustus in his old age had passed subsequently to the Julian statutes , for yet further enforcing the penalties on celibacy and for enriching the exchequer . <end>
<start> nec ideo coniugia et educationes liberum frequentabantur praevalida orbitate ceterum multitudo periclitantium gliscebat , cum omnis domus delatorum interpretationibus subverteretur , utque antehac flagitiis ita tunc legibus laborabatur . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile there was an increase in the number of persons imperilled , for every household was undermined by the insinuations of informers . <end>
<start> ea res admonet ut de principiis iuris et quibus modis ad hanc multitudinem infinitam ac varietatem legum perventum sit altius disseram . <end>$$<start> This suggests to me a fuller discussion of the origin of law and of the methods by which we have arrived at the present endless multiplicity and variety of our statutes . <end>
<start> Vetustissimi mortalium , nulla adhuc mala libidine , sine probro , scelere eoque sine poena aut coercitionibus agebant . <end>$$<start> Mankind in the earliest age lived for a time without a single vicious impulse , without shame or guilt , and , consequently , without punishment and restraints . <end>
<start> neque praemiis opus erat cum honesta suopte ingenio peterentur . <end>$$<start> Rewards were not needed when everything right was pursued on its own merits . <end>
<start> et ubi nihil contra morem cuperent , nihil per metum vetabantur . <end>$$<start> and as men desired nothing against morality , they were debarred from nothing by fear . <end>
<start> at postquam exui aequalitas et pro modestia ac pudore ambitio et vis incedebat , provenere dominationes multosque apud populos aeternum mansere . <end>$$<start> When however they began to throw off equality , and ambition and violence usurped the place of self-control and modesty , despotisms grew up and became perpetual among many nations . <end>
<start> quidam statim aut postquam regum pertaesum leges maluerunt . <end>$$<start> Some from the beginning , or when tired of kings , preferred codes of laws . <end>
<start> hae primo rudibus hominum animis simplices erant . <end>$$<start> These were at first simple , while men's minds were unsophisticated . <end>
<start> maximeque fama celebravit Cretensium , quas Minos , Spartanorum , quas Lycurgus , ac mox Atheniensibus quaesitiores iam et plures Solo perscripsit . <end>$$<start> The most famous of them were those of the Cretans , framed by Minos those of the Spartans , by Lycurgus , and , subsequently , those which Solan drew up for the Athenians on a more elaborate and extensive scale . <end>
<start> nobis Romulus ut libitum imperitaverat dein Numa religionibus et divino iure populum devinxit , repertaque quaedam a Tullo et Anco . <end>$$<start> Romulus governed us as he pleased then Numa united our people by religious ties and a constitution of divine origin , to which some additions were made by Tullus and Ancus . <end>
<start> sed praecipuus Servius Tullius sanctor legum fuit quis etiam reges obtemperarent . <end>$$<start> But Servius Tullius was our chief legislator , to whose laws even kings were to be subject . <end>
<start> Pulso Tarquinio adversum patrum factiones multa populus paravit tuendae libertatis et firmandae concordiae , creatique decemviri et accitis quae usquam egregia compositae duodecim tabulae , finis aequi iuris . <end>$$<start> After Tarquin's expulsion , the people , to check cabals among the Senators , devised many safeguards for freedom and for the establishment of unity . <end>
<start> nam secutae leges etsi aliquando in maleficos ex delicto , saepius tamen dissensione ordinum et apiscendi inlicitos honores aut pellendi claros viros aliaque ob prava per vim latae sunt . <end>$$<start> Decemvirs were appointed everything specially admirable elsewhere was adopted , and the Twelve Tables drawn up , the last specimen of equitable legislation . <end>
<start> corrupti spe aut inlusi per intercessionem socii . <end>$$<start> hence , the bribing of our allies by alluring promises and the cheating them by tribunes vetoes . <end>
<start> ac ne bello quidem Italico , mox civili omissum quin multa et diversa sciscerentur , donec Lucius Sulla dictator abolitis vel conversis prioribus , cum plura addidisset , otium eius rei haud in longum paravit , statim turbidis Lepidi rogationibus neque multo post tribunis reddita licentia quoquo vellent populum agitandi . <end>$$<start> Even the Italian and then the Civil war did not pass without the enactment of many conflicting laws , till Lucius Sulla , the Dictator , by the repeal or alteration of past legislation and by many additions , gave us a brief lull in this process , to be instantly followed by the seditious proposals of Lepidus , and soon afterwards by the tribunes recovering their license to excite the people just as they chose . <end>
<start> iamque non modo in commune sed in singulos homines latae quaestiones , et corruptissima re publica plurimae leges . <end>$$<start> And now bills were passed , not only for national objects but for individual cases , and laws were most numerous when the commonwealth was most corrupt . <end>
<start> Tum Gnaeus Pompeius , tertium consul corrigendis moribus delectus et gravior remediis quam delicta erant suarumque legum auctor idem ac subversor , quae armis tuebatur armis amisit . <end>$$<start> Cneius Pompeius was then for the third time elected consul to reform public morals , but in applying remedies more terrible than the evils and repealing the legislation of which he had himself been the author , he lost by arms what by arms he had been maintaining . <end>
<start> exim continua per viginti annos discordia , non mos , non ius . <end>$$<start> Then followed twenty years of continuous strife . <end>
<start> deterrima quaeque impune ac multa honesta exitio fuere . <end>$$<start> custom or law there was none . <end>
<start> sexto demum consulatu Caesar Augustus , potentiae securus , quae triumviratu iusserat abolevit deditque iura quis pace et principe uteremur . <end>$$<start> the vilest deeds went unpunished , while many noble acts brought ruin . <end>
<start> acriora ex eo vincla , inditi custodes et lege Papia Poppaea praemiis inducti ut , si a privilegiis parentum cessaretur , velut parens omnium populus vacantia teneret . <end>$$<start> At last , in his sixth consulship , Caesar Augustus , feeling his power secure , annulled the decrees of his triumvirate , and gave us a constitution which might serve us in peace under a monarchy . <end>
<start> et terror omnibus intentabatur ni Tiberius statuendo remedio quinque consularium , quinque e praetoriis , totidem e cetero senatu sorte duxisset apud quos exsoluti plerique legis nexus modicum in praesens levamentum fuere . <end>$$<start> Many men's fortunes were ruined , and over all there hung a terror till Tiberius , to provide a remedy , selected by lot five ex-consuls , five ex-praetors , and five senators , by whom most of the legal knots were disentangled and some light temporary relief afforded . <end>
<start> Per idem tempus Neronem e liberis Germanici iam ingressum iuventam commendavit patribus , utque munere capessendi vigintiviratus solveretur et quinquennio maturius quam per leges quaesturam peteret non sine inrisu audientium postulavit . <end>$$<start> About this same time he commended to the Senate's favour , Nero , Germanicus's son , who was just entering on manhood , and asked them , not without smiles of ridicule from his audience , to exempt him from serving as one of the Twenty Commissioners , and let him be a candidate for quaestorship five years earlier than the law allowed . <end>
<start> praetendebat sibi atque fratri decreta eadem petente Augusto . <end>$$<start> His excuse was that a similar decree had been made for himself and his brother at the request of Augustus . <end>
<start> sed neque tum fuisse dubitaverim qui eius modi preces occulti inluderent ac tamen initia fastigii Caesaribus erant magisque in oculis vetus mos , et privignis cum vitrico levior necessitudo quam avo adversum nepotem . <end>$$<start> But I cannot doubt that even then there were some who secretly laughed at such a petition , though the Caesars were but in the beginning of their grandeur , and ancient usage was more constantly before men's eyes , while also the tie between stepfather and stepson was weaker than that between grandfather and grandchild . <end>
<start> additur pontificatus et quo primum die forum ingressus est congiarium plebi admodum laetae quod Germanici stirpem iam puberem aspiciebat . <end>$$<start> The pontificate was likewise conferred on Nero , and on the day on which he first entered the forum , a gratuity was given to the city-populace , who greatly rejoiced at seeing a son of Germanicus now grown to manhood . <end>
<start> auctum dehinc gaudium nuptiis Neronis et Iuliae Drusi filiae . <end>$$<start> Their joy was further increased by Nero's marriage to Julia , Drusus's daughter . <end>
<start> utque haec secundo rumore ita adversis animis acceptum quod filio Claudii socer Seianus destinaretur . <end>$$<start> This news was met with favourable comments , but it was heard with disgust that Sejanus was to be the father-in-law of the son of Claudius . <end>
<start> polluisse nobilitatem familiae videbatur suspectumque iam nimiae spei Seianum ultra extulisse . <end>$$<start> The emperor was thought to have polluted the nobility of his house and to have yet further elevated Sejanus , whom they already suspected of overweening ambition . <end>
<start> Fine anni concessere vita insignes viri Lucius Volusius et Sallustius Crispus . <end>$$<start> Two remarkable men died at the end of the year , Lucius Volusius and Sallustius Crispus . <end>
<start> Volusio vetus familia neque tamen praeturam egressa ipse consulatum intulit , censoria etiam potestate legendis equitum decuriis functus , opumque quis domus illa immensum viguit primus adcumulator . <end>$$<start> he also held the office of censor for arranging the classes of the knights , and was the first to pile up the wealth which that house enjoyed to a boundless extent . <end>
<start> Crispum equestri ortum loco Gaius Sallustius , rerum Romanarum florentissimus auctor , sororis nepotem in nomen adscivit . <end>$$<start> Crispus was of equestrian descent and grandson of a sister of Caius Sallustius , that most admirable Roman historian , by whom he was adopted and whose name he took . <end>
<start> atque ille , quamquam prompto ad capessendos honores aditu , Maecenatem aemulatus sine dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium consulariumque potentia antiit , diversus a veterum instituto per cultum et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu propior . <end>$$<start> Though his road to preferment was easy , he chose to emulate Maecenas , and without rising to a senator's rank , he surpassed in power many who had won triumphs and consulships . <end>
<start> suberat tamen vigor animi ingentibus negotiis par , eo acrior quo somnum et inertiam magis ostentabat . <end>$$<start> He was a contrast to the manners of antiquity in his elegance and refinement , and in the sumptuousness of his wealth he was almost a voluptuary . <end>
<start> igitur incolumi Maecenate proximus , mox praecipuus , cui secreta imperatorum inniterentur , et interficiendi Postumi Agrippae conscius , aetate provecta speciem magis in amicitia principis quam vim tenuit . <end>$$<start> But beneath all this was a vigorous mind , equal to the greatest labours , the more active in proportion as he made a show of sloth and apathy . <end>
<start> idque et Maecenati acciderat , fato potentiae raro sempiternae , an satias capit aut illos cum omnia tribuerunt aut hos cum iam nihil reliquum est quod cupiant . <end>$$<start> The same too had happened to Maecenas , so rarely is it the destiny of power to be lasting , or perhaps a sense of weariness steals over princes when they have bestowed everything , or over favourites , when there is nothing left them to desire . <end>
<start> Sequitur Tiberi quartus , Drusi secundus consulatus , patris atque filii collegio insignis . <end>$$<start> Next followed Tiberius's fourth , Drusus's second consulship , memorable from the fact that father and son were colleagues . <end>
<start> nam triennio ante Germanici cum Tiberio idem honor neque patruo laetus neque natura tam conexus fuerat . <end>$$<start> Two years previously the association of Germanicus and Tiberius in the same honour had not been agreeable to the uncle , nor had it the link of so close a natural tie . <end>
<start> eius anni principio Tiberius quasi firmandae valetudini in Campaniam concessit , longam et continuam absentiam paulatim meditans , sive ut amoto patre Drusus munia consulatus solus impleret . <end>$$<start> At the beginning of this year Tiberius , avowedly to recruit his health , retired to Campania , either as a gradual preparation for long and uninterrupted seclusion , or in order that Drusus alone in his father's absence might discharge the duties of the consulship . <end>
<start> ac forte parva res magnum ad certamen progressa praebuit iuveni materiem apiscendi favoris . <end>$$<start> It happened that a mere trifle which grew into a sharp contest gave the young prince the means of acquiring popularity . <end>
<start> Domitius Corbulo praetura functus de Lucius Sulla nobili iuvene questus est apud senatum quod sibi inter spectacula gladiatorum loco non decessisset . <end>$$<start> Domitius Corbulo , an ex-praetor , complained to the Senate that Lucius Sulla , a young noble , had not given place to him at a gladiatorial show . <end>
<start> pro Corbulone aetas , patrius mos , studia seniorum erant contra Mamercus Scaurus et Lucius Arruntius aliique Sullae propinqui nitebantur . <end>$$<start> Corbulo had age , national usage and the feelings of the older senators in his favour . <end>
<start> certabantque orationibus et memorabantur exempla maiorum qui iuventutis inreverentiam gravibus decretis notavissent , donec Drusus apta temperandis animis disseruit . <end>$$<start> Against him Mamercus Scaurus , Lucius Arruntius and other kinsmen of Sulla strenuously exerted themselves . <end>
<start> idem Corbulo plurima per Italiam itinera fraude mancipum et incuria magistratuum interrupta et impervia clamitando , executionem eius negotii libens suscepit . <end>$$<start> It was this same Corbulo , who , after raising a cry that most of the roads in Italy were obstructed or impassable through the dishonesty of contractors and the negligence of officials , himself willingly undertook the complete management of the business . <end>
<start> quod haud perinde publice usui habitum quam exitiosum multis quorum in pecuniam atque famam damnationibus et hasta saeviebat . <end>$$<start> This proved not so beneficial to the State as ruinous to many persons , whose property and credit he mercilessly attacked by convictions and confiscations . <end>
<start> Neque multo post missis ad senatum litteris Tiberius motam rursum Africam incursu Tacfarinatis docuit , iudicioque patrum deligendum pro consule gnarum militiae , corpore validum et bello suffecturum . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards Tiberius informed the Senate by letter that Africa was again disturbed by an incursion of Tacfarinas , and that they must use their judgment in choosing as proconsul an experienced soldier of vigorous constitution , who would be equal to the war . <end>
<start> Pompeius agitandi adversus Marcum Lepidum odii nanctus , ut socordem , inopem et maioribus suis dedecorum eoque etiam Asiae sorte depellendum incusavit , adverso senatu qui Lepidum mitem magis quam ignavum , paternas ei angustias et nobilitatem sine probro actam honori quam ignominiae habendam ducebat . <end>$$<start> But the Senate were against him , for they thought Lepidus gentle rather than cowardly , and that his inherited poverty , with the high rank in which he had lived without a blot , ought to be considered a credit to instead of a reproach . <end>
<start> igitur missus in Asiam et de Africa decretum ut Caesar legeret cui mandanda foret . <end>$$<start> And so he was sent to Asia , and with respect to Africa it was decided that the emperor should choose to whom it was to be assigned . <end>
<start> Inter quae Severus Caecina censuit ne quem magistratum cui provincia obvenisset uxor comitaretur , multum ante repetito concordem sibi coniugem et sex partus enixam , seque quae in publicum statueret domi servavisse , cohibita intra Italiam , quamquam ipse pluris per provincias quadraginta stipendia explevisset . <end>$$<start> During this debate Severus Caecina proposed that no magistrate who had obtained a province should be accompanied by his wife He began by recounting at length how harmoniously he had lived with his wife , who had borne him six children , and how in his own home he had observed what he was proposing for the public , by having kept her in Italy , though he had himself served forty campaigns in various provinces . <end>
<start> haud enim frustra placitum olim ne feminae in socios aut gentis externas traherentur inesse mulierum comitatui quae pacem luxu , bellum formidine morentur et Romanum agmen ad similitudinem barbari incessus convertant . <end>$$<start> With good reason , he said , had it been formerly decided that women were not to be taken among our allies or into foreign countries . <end>
<start> non imbecillum tantum et imparem laboribus sexum sed , si licentia adsit , saevum , ambitiosum , potestatis avidum . <end>$$<start> A train of women involves delays through luxury in peace and through panic in war , and converts a Roman army on the march into the likeness of a barbarian progress . <end>
<start> praesedisse nuper feminam exercitio cohortium , decursu legionum . <end>$$<start> there are two centres of government , and the women's orders are the more despotic and intemperate . <end>
<start> Paucorum haec adsensu audita plures obturbabant neque relatum de negotio neque Caecinam dignum tantae rei censorem . <end>$$<start> A few heard this speech with approval , but the majority clamorously objected that there was no proper motion on the subject , and that Caecina was no fit censor on so grave an issue . <end>
<start> mox Valerius Messalinus , cui parens Messala ineratque imago paternae facundiae , respondit multa duritiae veterum IN melius et laetius mutata . <end>$$<start> Presently Valerius Messalinus , Messala's son , in whom the father's eloquence was reproduced , replied that much of the sternness of antiquity had been changed into a better and more genial system . <end>
<start> neque enim , ut olim , obsideri urbem bellis aut provincias hostilis esse . <end>$$<start> Rome , he said , is not now , as formerly , beset with wars , nor are the provinces hostile . <end>
<start> et pauca feminarum necessitatibus concidi quae ne coniugum quidem penatis , adeo socios non onerent . <end>$$<start> A few concessions are made to the wants of women , but such as are not even a burden to their husbands homes , much less to the allies . <end>
<start> cetera promisca cum marito nec ullum in eo pacis impedimentum . <end>$$<start> In all other respects man and wife share alike , and this arrangement involves no trouble in peace . <end>
<start> bella plane accinctis obeunda sed revertentibus post laborem quod honestius quam uxorium levamentum . <end>$$<start> War of course requires that men should be unincumbered , but when they return what worthier solace can they have after their hardships than a wife's society . <end>
<start> at quasdam in ambitionem aut avaritiam prolapsas . <end>$$<start> But some wives have abandoned themselves to scheming and rapacity . <end>
<start> quid . <end>$$<start> Well . <end>
<start> ipsorum magistratuum nonne plerosque variis libidinibus obnoxios . <end>$$<start> even among our magistrates , are not many subject to various passions . <end>
<start> non tamen ideo neminem in provinciam mitti . <end>$$<start> Still , that is not a reason for sending no one into a province . <end>
<start> corruptos saepe pravitatibus uxorum maritos num ergo omnis caelibes integros . <end>$$<start> Husbands have often been corrupted by the vices of their wives . <end>
<start> placuisse quondam Oppias leges , sic temporibus rei publicae postulantibus remissum aliquid postea et mitigatum , quia expedierit . <end>$$<start> Are then all unmarried men blameless The Oppian laws were formerly adopted to meet the political necessities of the time , and subsequently there was some remission and mitigation of them on grounds of expediency . <end>
<start> frustra nostram ignaviam alia ad vocabula transferri nam viri in eo culpam si femina modum excedat . <end>$$<start> It is idle to shelter our own weakness under other names . <end>
<start> porro ob unius aut alterius imbecillum animum male eripi maritis consortia rerum secundarum adversarumque . <end>$$<start> for it is the husband's fault if the wife transgresses propriety . <end>
<start> vix praesenti custodia manere inlaesa coniugia quid fore si per pluris annos in modum discidii oblitterentur . <end>$$<start> What would happen were it for a number of years to be forgotten , just as in a divorce . <end>
<start> sic obviam irent iis quae alibi peccarentur ut flagitiorum urbis meminissent . <end>$$<start> You must not check vices abroad without remembering the scandals of the capital . <end>
<start> addidit pauca Drusus de matrimonio suo . <end>$$<start> Drusus added a few words on his own experience as a husband . <end>
<start> nam principibus adeunda saepius longinqua imperii . <end>$$<start> Princes , he said , must often visit the extremities of their empire . <end>
<start> Lepidum et Iunium Blaesum nominavit ex quis pro consule Africae legeretur . <end>$$<start> Both spoke on the subject , and Lepidus begged earnestly to be excused . <end>
<start> tum audita amborum verba , intentius excusante se Lepido , cum valetudinem corporis , aetatem liberum , nubilem filiam obtenderet , intellegereturque etiam quod silebat , avunculum esse Seiani Blaesum atque eo praevalidum . <end>$$<start> He alleged ill-health , his children's tender age , his having a daughter to marry , and something more of which he said nothing , was well understood , the fact that Blaesus was uncle of Sejanus and so had very powerful interest . <end>
<start> respondit Blaesus specie recusantis sed neque eadem adseveratione et consensu adulantium adiutus est . <end>$$<start> Blaesus replied with an affectation of refusal , but not with the same persistency , nor was he backed up by the acquiescence of flatterers . <end>
<start> Exim promptum quod multorum intimis questibus tegebatur . <end>$$<start> Next was exposed an abuse , hitherto the subject of many a whispered complaint . <end>
<start> incedebat enim deterrimo cuique licentia impune probra et invidiam in bonos excitandi arrepta imagine Caesaris libertique etiam ac servi , patrono vel domino cum voces , cum manus intentarent , ultro metuebantur . <end>$$<start> The vilest wretches used a growing freedom in exciting insult and obloquy against respectable citizens , and escaped punishment by clasping some statue of the emperor . <end>
<start> igitur Gaius Cestius senator disseruit principes quidem instar deorum esse , sed neque a diis nisi iustas supplicum preces audiri neque quemquam in Capitolium aliave urbis templa perfugere ut eo subsidio ad flagitia utatur . <end>$$<start> The very freedman or slave was often an actual terror to his patron or master whom he would menace by word and gesture . <end>
<start> abolitas leges et funditus versas , ubi in foro , in limine curiae ab Annia Rufilla , quam fraudis sub iudice damnavisset , probra sibi et minae intendantur , neque ipse audeat ius experiri ob effigiem imperatoris oppositam . <end>$$<start> Accordingly Caius Cestius , a senator , argued that though princes were like deities , yet even the gods listened only to righteous prayers from their suppliants , and that no one fled to the Capitol or any other temple in Rome to use it as an auxiliary in crime . <end>
<start> Et Considius Aequus et Caelius cursor equites Romani quod fictis maiestatis criminibus Magium Caecilianum praetorem petivissent auctore principe ac decreto senatus puniti . <end>$$<start> Considius Aequus too and Coelius Cursor , Roman knights , were punished on the emperor's proposal , by a decree of the Senate , for having attacked the praetor , Magius Caecilianus , with false charges of treason . <end>
<start> utrumque in laudem Drusi trahebatur ab eo in urbe inter coetus et sermones hominum obversante secreta patris mitigari . <end>$$<start> Both these results were represented as an honour to Drusus By moving in society at Rome , amid popular talk , his father's dark policy , it was thought , was mitigated . <end>
<start> neque luxus in iuvene adeo displicebat huc potius intenderet , diem aedificationibus noctem conviviis traheret , quam solus et nullis voluptatibus avocatus maestam vigilantiam et malas curas exerceret . <end>$$<start> Even voluptuousness in one so young gave little offence Better that he should incline that way , spend his days in architecture , his nights in banquets , than that he should live in solitude , cut off from every pleasure , and absorbed in a gloomy vigilance and mischievous schemes . <end>
<start> Non enim Tiberius , non accusatores fatiscebant . <end>$$<start> Tiberius indeed and the informers were never weary . <end>
<start> et Ancharius Priscus Caesium Cordum pro consule Cretae postulaverat repetundis , addito maiestatis crimine , quod tum omnium accusationum complementum erat . <end>$$<start> Ancharius Priscus had prosecuted Caesius Cordus , proconsul of Crete , for extortion , adding a charge of treason , which then crowned all indictments . <end>
<start> Caesar Antistium Veterem e primoribus Macedoniae , absolutum adulterii , increpitis iudicibus ad dicendam maiestatis causam retraxit , ut turbidum et Rhescuporidis consiliis permixtum , qua tempestate Cotye fratre interfecto bellum adversus nos volverat . <end>$$<start> Antistius Vetus , one of the chief men of Macedonia , who had been acquitted of adultery , was recalled by the emperor himself , with a censure on the judges , to be tried for treason , as a seditious man who had been implicated in the designs of Rhescuporis , when that king after the murder of his brother Cotys had meditated war against us . <end>
<start> igitur aqua et igni interdictum reo , adpositumque ut teneretur insula neque Macedoniae neque Thraeciae opportuna . <end>$$<start> The accused was accordingly outlawed , with the further sentence that he was to be confined in an island from which neither Macedonia nor Thrace were conveniently accessible . <end>
<start> nam Thraecia diviso imperio in Rhoemetalcen et libetos Cotyis , quis ob infantiam tutor erat Trebellenus Rufus , insolentia nostri discors agebat neque minus Rhoemetalcen quam Trebellenum incusans popularium iniurias inultas sinere . <end>$$<start> As for Thrace , since the division of the kingdom between Rhoemetalces and the children of Cotys , who because of their tender age were under the guardianship of Trebellienus Rufus , it was divided against itself , from not being used to our rule , and blamed Rhoemetalces no less than Trebellienus for allowing the wrongs of his countrymen to go unpunished . <end>
<start> Coelaletae Odrusaeque et Dii , validae nationes , arma cepere , ducibus diversis et paribus inter se per ignobilitatem . <end>$$<start> The Coelaletae , Odrusae and Dii , powerful tribes , took up arms , under different leaders , all on a level from their obscurity . <end>
<start> quae causa fuit ne in bellum atrox coalescerent . <end>$$<start> This hindered them from combining in a formidable war . <end>
<start> pars turbant praesentia , alii montem Haemum transgrediuntur ut remotos populos concirent . <end>$$<start> Some roused their immediate neighbourhood others crossed Mount Haemus , to stir up remote tribes . <end>
<start> plurimi ac maxime compositi regem urbemque Philippopolim , a Macedone Philippo sitam , circumsidunt . <end>$$<start> most of them , and the best disciplined , besieged the king in the city of Philippopolis , founded by the Macedonian Philip . <end>
<start> Quae ubi cognita Publius Vellaeo (is proximum exercitum praesidebat) , alarios equites ac levis cohortium mittit in eos qui praedabundi aut adsumendis auxiliis vagabantur , ipse robur peditum ad exolvendum obsidium ducit . <end>$$<start> When this was known to Publius Vellaeus who commanded the nearest army , he sent some allied cavalry and light infantry to attack those who were roaming in quest of plunder or of reinforcements , while he marched in person with the main strength of the foot to raise the siege . <end>
<start> simulque cuncta prospere acta , caesis populatoribus et dissensione orta apud obsidentis regisque opportuna eruptione et adventu legionis . <end>$$<start> dissensions broke out among the besiegers , and the king made a well-timed sally just as the legion arrived . <end>
<start> Eodem anno Galliarum civitates ob magnitudinem aeris alieni rebellionem coeptavere , cuius extimulator acerrimus inter Treviros Iulius Florus , apud Aeduos Iulius Sacrovir . <end>$$<start> That same year , some states of Gaul , under the pressure of heavy debts , attempted a revolt . <end>
<start> nobilitas ambobus et maiorum bona facta eoque Romana civitas olim data , cum id rarum nec nisi virtuti pretium esset . <end>$$<start> Both could show noble birth and signal services rendered by ancestors , for which Roman citizenship had formerly been granted them , when the gift was rare and a recompense only of merit . <end>
<start> ii secretis conloquiis , ferocissimo quoque adsumpto aut quibus ob egestatem ac metum ex flagitiis maxima peccandi necessitudo , componunt Florus Belgas , Sacrovir propiores Gallos concire . <end>$$<start> In secret conferences to which the fiercest spirits were admitted , or any to whom poverty or the fear of guilt was an irresistible stimulus to crime , they arranged that Florus was to rouse the Belgae , Sacrovir the Gauls nearer home . <end>
<start> igitur per conciliabula et coetus seditiosa disserebant de continuatione tributorum , gravitate faenoris , saevitia ac superbia praesidentium , et discordare militem audito Germanici exitio . <end>$$<start> These men accordingly talked sedition before small gatherings and popular assemblies about the perpetual tributes , the oppressive usury , the cruelty and arrogance of their governors , hinting too that there was disaffection among our soldiers , since they had heard of the murder of Germanicus . <end>
<start> Haud ferme ulla civitas intacta seminibus eius motus fuit sed erupere primi Andecavi ac Turoni . <end>$$<start> Scarcely a single community was untouched by the germs of this commotion . <end>
<start> quorum Andecavos Acilius Aviola legatus excita cohorte quae Lugduni praesidium agitabat coercuit . <end>$$<start> Of these the former were put down by an officer , Acilius Aviola , who had summoned a cohort which was on garrison duty at Lugdunum . <end>
<start> Turoni legionario milite quem Visellius Varro inferioris Germaniae legatus miserat oppressi eodem Aviola duce et quibusdam Galliarum primoribus , qui tulere auxilium quo dissimularent defectionem magisque in tempore efferrent . <end>$$<start> The Turoni were quelled by some legionary troops sent by Visellius Varro who commanded in Lower Germany , and led by the same Aviola and some Gallic chieftains who brought aid , in order that they might disguise their disaffection and exhibit it at a better opportunity . <end>
<start> spectatus et Sacrovir intecto capite pugnam pro Romanis ciens ostentandae , ut ferebat , virtutis sed captivi ne incesseretur telis adgnoscendum se praebuisse arguebant . <end>$$<start> Sacrovir too was conspicuous , with head uncovered , cheering on his men to fight for Rome , to display , as he said , his valour . <end>
<start> consultus super eo Tiberius aspernatus est indicium aluitque dubitatione bellum . <end>$$<start> Tiberius when consulted on the matter disdained the information , and fostered the war by his irresolution . <end>
<start> Interim Florus insistere destinatis , pellicere alam equitum , quae conscripta e Treviris militia disciplinaque nostra habebatur , ut caesis negotiatoribus Romanis bellum inciperet . <end>$$<start> Florus meanwhile followed up his designs and tried to induce a squadron of cavalry levied among the Treveri , trained in our service and discipline , to begin hostilities by a massacre of the Roman traders . <end>
<start> paucique equitum corrupti , plures in officio mansere . <end>$$<start> He corrupted a few of the men , but the majority were steadfast in their allegiance . <end>
<start> aliud vulgus obaeratorum aut clientium arma cepit petebantque saltus quibus nomen Arduenna , cum legiones utroque ab exercitu , quas Visellius et Gaius Silius adversis itineribus obiecerant , arcuerunt . <end>$$<start> A host however of debtors and dependents took up arms , and they were on their way to the forest passes known as the Arduenna , when they were stopped by legions which Visellius and Silius had sent from their respective armies , by opposite routes , to meet them . <end>
<start> praemissusque cum delecta manu Iulius Indus e civitate eadem , discors Floro et ob id navandae operae avidior , inconditam multitudinem adhuc disiecit . <end>$$<start> Julius Indus from the same state , who was at feud with Florus and therefore particularly eager to render us a service , was sent on in advance with a picked force , and dispersed the undisciplined rabble . <end>
<start> Florum incertis latebris victores frustratus , postremo visis militibus , qui effugia insederant , sua manu cecidit . <end>$$<start> Florus after eluding the conquerors by hiding himself in one place after another , at last when he saw some soldiers who had barred every possible escape , fell by his own hand . <end>
<start> isque Trevirici tumultus finis . <end>$$<start> Such was the end of the rebellion of the Treveri . <end>
<start> Apud Aeduos maior moles exorta quanto civitas opulentior et comprimendi procul praesidium . <end>$$<start> A more formidable movement broke out among the Aedui , proportioned to the greater wealth of the state and the distance of the force which should repress it . <end>
<start> Augustodunum caput gentis armatis cohortibus Sacrovir occupaverat ut nobilissimam Galliarum subolem , liberalibus studiis ibi operatam , et eo pignore parentes propinquosque eorum adiungeret . <end>$$<start> Sacrovir with some armed cohorts had made himself master of Augustodunum , the capital of the tribe , with the noblest youth of Gaul , there devoting themselves to a liberal education , and with such hostages he proposed to unite in his cause their parents and kinsfolk . <end>
<start> simul arma occulte fabricata iuventuti dispertit . <end>$$<start> He also distributed among the youth arms which he had had secretly manufactured . <end>
<start> quadraginta milia fuere , quinta sui parte legionariis armis , ceteri cum venabulis et cultris quaeque alia venantibus tela sunt . <end>$$<start> There were forty thousand , one fifth armed like our legionaries . <end>
<start> adduntur e servitiis gladiaturae destinati quibus more gentico continuum ferri tegimen cruppellarios vocant , inferendis ictibus inhabilis , accipiendis impenetrabilis . <end>$$<start> the rest had spears and knives and other weapons used in the chase In addition were some slaves who were being trained for gladiators , clad after the national fashion in a complete covering of steel . <end>
<start> augebantur eae copiae vicinarum civitatum ut nondum aperta consensione , ita viritim promptis studiis , et certamine ducum Romanorum , quos inter ambigebatur utroque bellum sibi poscente . <end>$$<start> They were called crupellarii , and though they were ill-adapted for inflicting wounds , they were impenetrable to them . <end>
<start> At Romae non Treviros modo et Aeduos sed quattuor et sexaginta Galliarum civitates descivisse , adsumptos in societatem Germanos , dubias Hispanias , cuncta , ut mos famae , in maius credita . <end>$$<start> At Rome meanwhile people said that it was not only the Treveri and Aedui who had revolted , but sixty-four states of Gaul with the Germans in alliance , while Spain too was disaffected . <end>
<start> an Sacrovirum maiestatis crimine reum in senatu fore . <end>$$<start> We have at last found men to check those murderous missives by the sword . <end>
<start> extitisse tandem viros qui cruentas epistulas armis cohiberent . <end>$$<start> Even war is a good exchange for a miserable peace . <end>
<start> Interim Silius cum legionibus duabus incedens praemissa auxiliari manu vastat Sequanorum pagos qui finium extremi et Aeduis contermini sociique in armis erant . <end>$$<start> Silius meantime was advancing with two legions , and having sent forward some auxiliary troops was ravaging those villages of the Sequani , which , situated on the border , adjoin the Aedui , and were associated with them in arms . <end>
<start> mox Augustodunum petit propero agmine , certantibus inter se signiferis , fremente etiam gregario milite , ne suetam requiem , ne spatia noctium opperiretur viderent modo adversos et aspicerentur . <end>$$<start> He then pushed on by forced marches to Augustodunum , his standard-bearers vying in zeal , and even the privates loudly protesting against any halt for their usual rest or during the hours of night . <end>
<start> in fronte statuerat ferratos , in cornibus cohortis , a tergo semermos . <end>$$<start> Twelve miles from Augustodunum they saw before them Sacrovir and his army in an open plain . <end>
<start> ipse inter primores equo insigni adire , memorare veteres Gallorum glorias quaeque Romanis adversa intulissent . <end>$$<start> His men in armour he had posted in the van , his light infantry on the wings , and the half-armed in the rear . <end>
<start> Non diu haec nec apud laetos etenim propinquabat legionum acies , inconditique ac militiae nescii oppidani neque oculis neque auribus satis competebant . <end>$$<start> His words were brief and heard without exultation For now the legions in battle array were advancing , and the rabble of townsfolk who knew nothing of war had their faculties of sight and hearing quite paralysed . <end>
<start> contra Silius , etsi praesumpta spes hortandi causas exemerat , clamitabat tamen pudendum ipsis quod Germaniarum victores adversum Gallos tamquam in hostem ducerentur . <end>$$<start> Only the other day the rebel Turoni had been discomfited by a single cohort , the Treveri by one cavalry squadron , the Sequani by a few companies of this very army . <end>
<start> una nuper cohors rebellem Turonum , una ala Trevirum , paucae huius ipsius exercitus turmae profligavere Sequanos . <end>$$<start> Prove to these Aedui once for all that the more they abound in wealth and luxury , the more unwarlike are they , but spare them when they flee . <end>
<start> quanto pecunia dites et voluptatibus opulentos tanto magis imbellis Aeduos evincite et fugientibus consulite . <end>$$<start> Then there was a deafening cheer the cavalry threw itself on the flanks , and the infantry charged the van . <end>
<start> ingens ad ea clamor et circumfudit eques frontemque pedites invasere , nec cunctatum apud latera . <end>$$<start> On the wings there was but a brief resistance The men in mail were somewhat of an obstacle , as the iron plates did not yield to javelins or swords . <end>
<start> paulum morae attulere ferrati , restantibus lamminis adversum pila et gladios . <end>$$<start> but our men , snatching up hatchets and pickaxes , hacked at their bodies and their armour as if they were battering a wall . <end>
<start> set miles correptis securibus et dolabris , ut si murum perrumperet , caedere tegmina et corpora . <end>$$<start> Some beat down the unwieldy mass with pikes and forked poles , and they were left lying on the ground , without an effort to rise , like dead men . <end>
<start> quidam trudibus aut furcis inertem molem prosternere , iacentesque nullo ad resurgendum nisu quasi exanimes linquebantur . <end>$$<start> Sacrovir with his most trustworthy followers hurried first to Augustodunum and then , from fear of being surrendered , to an adjacent country house . <end>
<start> illic sua manu , reliqui mutuis ictibus occidere incensa super villa omnis cremavit . <end>$$<start> The house was fired over their heads , and with it they were all consumed . <end>
<start> neque dempsit aut addidit vero , sed fide ac virtute legatos , se consiliis superfuisse . <end>$$<start> He also gave the reasons why neither he himself nor Drusus had gone to the war . <end>
<start> simul causas cur non ipse , non Drusus profecti ad id bellum forent , adiunxit , magnitudinem imperii extollens , neque decorum principibus , si una alterave civitas turbet * * omissa urbe , unde in omnia regimem . <end>$$<start> he magnified the greatness of the empire , and said it would be undignified for emperors , whenever there was a commotion in one or two states , to quit the capital , the centre of all government . <end>
<start> nunc quia non metu ducatur iturum ut praesentia spectaret componeretque . <end>$$<start> Now , as he was not influenced by fear , he would go to examine and settle matters . <end>
<start> decrevere patres vota pro reditu eius supplicationesque et alia decora . <end>$$<start> The Senate decreed vows for his safe return , with thanksgivings and other appropriate ceremonies . <end>
<start> solus Dolabella Cornelius dum antire ceteros parat absurdam in adulationem progressus , censuit ut ovans e Campania urbem introiret . <end>$$<start> Cornelius Dolabella alone , in endeavouring to outdo the other Senators , went the length of a preposterous flattery by proposing that he should enter Rome from Campania with an ovation . <end>
<start> igitur secutae Caesaris litterae quibus se non tam vacuum gloria praedicabat ut post ferocissimas gentis perdomitas , tot receptos in iuventa aut spretos triumphos , iam senior peregrinationis suburbanae inane praemium peteret . <end>$$<start> Thereupon came a letter from the emperor , declaring that he was not so destitute of renown as after having subdued the most savage nations and received or refused so many triumphs in his youth , to covet now that he was old an unmeaning honour for a tour in the neighbourhood of Rome . <end>
<start> Sub idem tempus ut mors Sulpicii Quirini publicis exequiis frequentaretur petivit a senatu . <end>$$<start> About the same time he requested the Senate to let the death of Sulpicius Quirinus be celebrated with a public funeral . <end>
<start> nihil ad veterem et patriciam Sulpiciorum familiam Quirinius pertinuit , ortus apud municipium Lanuvium sed impiger militiae et acribus ministeriis consulatum sub divo Augusto , mox expugnatis per Ciliciam Homonadensium castellis insignia triumphi adeptus , datusque rector G . <end>$$<start> With the old patrician family of the Sulpicii this Quirinus , who was born in the town of Lanuvium , was quite unconnected An indefatigable soldier , he had by his zealous services won the consulship under the Divine Augustus , and subsequently the honours of a triumph for having stormed some fortresses of the Homonadenses in Cilicia . <end>
<start> Tiberium quoque Rhodi agentem coluerat quod tunc patefecit in senatu , laudatis in se officiis et incusato Marcus Lollio , quem auctorem Gaio Caesari pravitatis et discordiarum arguebat . <end>$$<start> The emperor now made all this known to the Senate , and extolled the good offices of Quirinus to himself , while he censured Marcus Lollius , whom he charged with encouraging Caius Caesar in his perverse and quarrelsome behaviour . <end>
<start> sed ceteris haud laeta memoria Quirini erat ob intenta , ut memoravi , Lepidae pericula sordidamque et praepotentem senectam . <end>$$<start> But people generally had no pleasure in the memory of Quirinus , because of the perils he had brought , as I have related , on Lepida , and the meanness and dangerous power of his last years . <end>
<start> Fine anni Clutorium Priscum equitem Romanum , post celebre carmen quo Germanici suprema defleverat , pecunia donatum a Caesare , corripuit delator , obiectans aegro Druso composuisse quod , si extinctus foret , maiore praemio vulgaretur . <end>$$<start> At the close of the year , Caius Lutorius Priscus , a Roman knight , who , after writing a popular poem bewailing the death of Germanicus , had received a reward in money from the emperor , was fastened on by an informer , and charged with having composed another during the illness of Drusus , which , in the event of the prince's death , might be published with even greater profit to himself . <end>
<start> id Clutorius in domo Publius Petronii socru eius Vitellia coram multisque inlustribus feminis per vaniloquentiam legerat . <end>$$<start> He had in his vanity read it in the house of Publius Petronius before Vitellia , Petronius's mother-in-law , and several ladies of rank . <end>
<start> ut delator extitit , ceteris ad dicendum testimonium exterritis , sola Vitellia nihil se audivisse adseveravit . <end>$$<start> As soon as the accuser appeared , all but Vitellia were frightened into giving evidence . <end>
<start> sed arguentibus ad perniciem plus fidei fuit , sententiaque Haterii Agrippae consulis designati indictum reo ultimum supplicium . <end>$$<start> She alone swore that she had heard not a word But those who criminated him fatally were rather believed , and on the motion of Haterius Agrippa , the consul-elect , the last penalty was invoked on the accused . <end>
<start> saepe audivi principem nostrum conquerentem si quis sumpta morte misericordiam eius praevenisset . <end>$$<start> if put to death , he will be no warning to others . <end>
<start> vita Clutorii in integro est , qui neque servatus in periculum rei publicae neque interfectus in exemplum ibit . <end>$$<start> His productions are as empty and ephemeral as they are replete with folly . <end>
<start> nec quicquam grave ac serium ex eo metuas qui suorum ipse flagitiorum proditor non virorum animis sed muliercularum adrepit . <end>$$<start> However , let him leave Rome , lose his property , and be outlawed . <end>
<start> cedat tamen urbe et bonis amissis aqua et igni arceatur quod perinde censeo ac si lege maiestatis teneretur . <end>$$<start> That is my proposal , just as though he were convicted under the law of treason . <end>
<start> Solus Lepido Rubellius Blandus e consularibus adsensit ceteri sententiam Agrippae secuti , ductusque in carcerem Priscus ac statim exanimatus . <end>$$<start> Only one of the ex-consuls , Rubellius Blandus , supported Lepidus The rest voted with Agrippa . <end>
<start> id Tiberius solitis sibi ambagibus apud senatum incusavit , cum extolleret pietatem quamvis modicas principis iniurias acriter ulciscentium , deprecare tam praecipitis verborum poenas , laudaret Lepidum neque Agrippam argueret . <end>$$<start> Priscus was dragged off to prison and instantly put to death Of this Tiberius complained to the Senate with his usual ambiguity , extolling their loyalty in so sharply avenging the very slightest insults to the sovereign , though he deprecated such hasty punishment of mere words , praising Lepidus and not censuring Agrippa . <end>
<start> igitur factum senatus consultum ne decreta patrum ante diem decimum ad aerarium deferrentur idque vitae spatium damnatis prorogaretur . <end>$$<start> So the Senate passed a resolution that their decrees should not be registered in the treasury till nine days had expired , and so much respite was to be given to condemned persons . <end>
<start> sed non senatui libertas ad paenitendum erat neque Tiberius interiectu temporis mitigabatur . <end>$$<start> Still the Senate had not liberty to alter their purpose , and lapse of time never softened Tiberius . <end>
<start> Haterius consules sequuntur , inturbidus externis rebus annus , domi suspecta severitate adversum luxum qui immensum proruperat ad cuncta quis pecunia prodigitur . <end>$$<start> Some expenses , though very serious , were generally kept secret by a concealment of the real prices . <end>
<start> sed Tiberius saepe apud se pensitato an coerceri tam profusae cupidines possent , num coercitio plus damni in rem publicam ferret , quam indecorum adtrectare quod non obtineret vel retentum ignominiam et infamiam virorum inlustrium posceret , postremo litteras ad senatum composuit quarum sententia in hunc modum fuit . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , after long considering whether such reckless tastes could be repressed , whether the repression of them would not be still more hurtful to the State , also , how undignified it would be to meddle with what he could not succeed in , or what , if effected , would necessitate the disgrace and infamy of men of distinction , at last addressed a letter to the Senate to the following purport : - . <end>
<start> Ceteris forsitan in rebus , patres conscripti , magis expediat me coram interrogari et dicere quid e re publica censeam in hac relatione subtrahi oculos meos melius fuit , ne , denotantibus vobis ora ac metum singulorum qui pudendi luxus arguerentur , ipse etiam viderem eos ac velut deprenderem . <end>$$<start> Perhaps in any other matter , Senators , it would be more convenient that I should be consulted in your presence , and then state what I think to be for the public good . <end>
<start> quod si mecum ante viri strenui , aediles , consilium habuissent , nescio an suasurus fuerim omittere potius praevalida et adulta vitia quam hoc adsequi , ut palam fieret quibus flagitiis impares essemus . <end>$$<start> In this debate it was better that my eyes should not be on you , for while you were noting the anxious faces of individual senators charged with shameful luxury , I too myself might observe them and , as it were , detect them . <end>
<start> sed illi quidem officio functi sunt , ut ceteros quoque magistratus sua munia implere velim mihi autem neque honestum silere neque proloqui expeditum , quia non aedilis aut praetoris aut consulis partis sustineo . <end>$$<start> Had those energetic men , our aediles , first taken counsel with me , I do not know whether I should not have advised them to let alone vices so strong and so matured , rather than merely attain the result of publishing what are the corruptions with which we cannot cope . <end>
<start> quid enim primum prohibere et priscum ad morem recidere adgrediar . <end>$$<start> For what am I first to begin with restraining and cutting down to the old standard . <end>
<start> villarumne infinita spatia . <end>$$<start> The vast dimensions of country houses . <end>
<start> familiarum numerum et nationes . <end>$$<start> The number of slaves of every nationality . <end>
<start> argenti et auri pondus . <end>$$<start> The masses of silver and gold . <end>
<start> aeris tabularumque miracula . <end>$$<start> The marvels in bronze and painting . <end>
<start> promiscas viris et feminis vestis atque illa feminarum propria , quis lapidum causa pecuniae nostrae ad externas aut hostilis gentis transferuntur . <end>$$<start> The apparel worn indiscriminately by both sexes , or that peculiar luxury of women which , for the sake of jewels , diverts our wealth to strange or hostile nations . <end>
<start> Nec ignoro in conviviis et circulis incusari ista et modum posci set si quis legem sanciat , poenas indicat , idem illi civitatem verti , splendidissimo cuique exitium parari , neminem criminis expertem clamitabunt . <end>$$<start> I am not unaware that people at entertainments and social gatherings condemn all this and demand some restriction . <end>
<start> atqui ne corporis quidem morbos veteres et diu auctos nisi per dura et aspera coerceas corruptus simul et corruptor , aeger et flagrans animus haud levioribus remediis restinguendus est quam libidinibus ardescit . <end>$$<start> But if a law were to be passed and a penalty imposed , those very same persons will cry out that the State is revolutionised , that ruin is plotted against all our most brilliant fashion , that not a citizen is safe from incrimination . <end>
<start> tot a maioribus repertae leges , tot quas divus Augustus tulit , illae oblivione , hae , quod flagitiosius est , contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere . <end>$$<start> Yet as even bodily disorders of long standing and growth can be checked only by sharp and painful treatment , so the fever of a diseased mind , itself polluted and a pollution to others , can be quenched only by remedies as strong as the passions which inflame it . <end>
<start> nam si velis quod nondum vetitum est , timeas ne vetere at si prohibita impune transcenderis , neque metus ultra neque pudor est . <end>$$<start> Of the many laws devised by our ancestors , of the many passed by the Divine Augustus , the first have been forgotten , while his (all the more to our disgrace) have become obsolete through contempt , and this has made luxury bolder than ever . <end>
<start> quia sibi quisque moderabatur , quia unius urbis cives eramus . <end>$$<start> Nor even afterwards had we the same temptations , while our dominion was confined to Italy . <end>
<start> ne inritamenta quidem eadem intra Italiam dominantibus . <end>$$<start> Victories over the foreigner taught us how to waste the substance of others . <end>
<start> externis victoriis aliena , civilibus etiam nostra consumere didicimus . <end>$$<start> victories over ourselves , how to squander our own . <end>
<start> quantulum istud est de quo aediles admonent! quam , si cetera respicias , in levi habendum! at hercule nemo refert quod Italia externae opis indiget , quod vita populi Romani per incerta maris et tempestatum cotidie volvitur . <end>$$<start> What a paltry matter is this of which the aediles are reminding us! What a mere trifle if you look at everything else! No one represents to the Senate that Italy requires supplies from abroad , and that the very existence of the people of Rome is daily at the mercy of uncertain waves and storms . <end>
<start> ac nisi provinciarum copiae et dominis et servitiis et agris subvenerint , nostra nos scilicet nemora nostraeque villae tuebuntur . <end>$$<start> And unless masters , slaves , and estates have the resources of the provinces as their mainstay , our shrubberies , forsooth , and our country houses will have to support us . <end>
<start> haec omissa funditus rem publicam trahet . <end>$$<start> The cure for other evils must be sought in our own hearts . <end>
<start> reliquis intra animum medendum est nos pudor , pauperes necessitas , divites satias in melius mutet . <end>$$<start> Let us be led to amendment , the poor by constraint , the rich by satiety . <end>
<start> aut si quis ex magistratibus tantam industriam ac severitatem pollicetur ut ire obviam queat , hunc ego et laudo et exonerari laborum meorum partem fateor sin accusare vitia volunt , dein , cum gloriam eius rei adepti sunt , simultates faciunt ac mihi relinquunt , credite , patres conscripti , me quoque non esse offensionum avidum . <end>$$<start> Or if any of our officials give promise of such energy and strictness as can stem the corruption , I praise the man , and I confess that I am relieved of a portion of my burdens . <end>
<start> Auditis Caesaris litteris remissa aedilibus talis cura luxusque mensae a fine Actiaci belli ad ea arma quis Servius Galba rerum adeptus est per annos centum profusis sumptibus exerciti paulatim exolevere . <end>$$<start> When they had heard the emperor's letter , the aediles were excused from so anxious a task , and that luxury of the table which from the close of the war ended at Actium to the armed revolution in which Servius Galba rose to empire , had been practised with profuse expenditure , gradually went out of fashion . <end>
<start> causas eius mutationis quaerere libet . <end>$$<start> It is as well that I should trace the causes of this change . <end>
<start> dites olim familiae nobilium aut claritudine insignes studio magnificentiae prolabebantur . <end>$$<start> Formerly rich or highly distinguished noble families often sank into ruin from a passion for splendour . <end>
<start> postquam caedibus saevitum et magnitudo famae exitio erat , ceteri ad sapientiora convertere . <end>$$<start> After the savage massacres in which greatness of renown was fatal , the survivors turned to wiser ways . <end>
<start> simul novi homines e municipiis et coloniis atque etiam provinciis in senatum crebro adsumpti domesticam parsimoniam intulerunt , et quamquam fortuna vel industria plerique pecuniosam ad senectam pervenirent , mansit tamen prior animus . <end>$$<start> The new men who were often admitted into the Senate from the towns , colonies and even the provinces , introduced their household thrift , and though many of them by good luck or energy attained an old age of wealth , still their former tastes remained . <end>
<start> sed praecipuus adstricti moris auctor Vespasianus fuit , antiquo ipse cultu victuque . <end>$$<start> But the chief encourager of strict manners was Vespasian , himself old-fashioned both in his dress and diet . <end>
<start> obsequium inde in principem et aemulandi amor validior quam poena ex legibus et metus . <end>$$<start> Henceforth a respectful feeling towards the prince and a love of emulation proved more efficacious than legal penalties or terrors . <end>
<start> nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis , ut quem ad modum temporum vices ita morum vertantur . <end>$$<start> Or possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle , and there may be moral revolutions just as there are changes of seasons . <end>
<start> nec omnia apud priores meliora , sed nostra quoque aetas multa laudis et artium imitanda posteris tulit . <end>$$<start> Nor was everything better in the past , but our own age too has produced many specimens of excellence and culture for posterity to imitate . <end>
<start> verum haec nobis in maiores certamina ex honesto maneant . <end>$$<start> May we still keep up with our ancestors a rivalry in all that is honourable! . <end>
<start> Tiberius , fama moderationis parta quod ingruentis accusatores represserat , mittit litteras ad senatum quis potestatem tribuniciam Druso petebat . <end>$$<start> Tiberius having gained credit for forbearance by the check he had given to the growing terror of the informers , wrote a letter to the Senate requesting the tribunitian power for Drusus . <end>
<start> id summi fastigii vocabulum Augustus repperit , ne regis aut dictatoris nomen adsumeret ac tamen appellatione aliqua cetera imperia praemineret . <end>$$<start> This was a phrase which Augustus devised as a designation of supremacy , so that without assuming the name of king or dictator he might have some title to mark his elevation above all other authority . <end>
<start> Marcum deinde Agrippam socum eius potestatis , quo defuncto Tiberium Neronem delegit ne successor in incerto foret . <end>$$<start> He then chose Marcus Agrippa to be his associate in this power , and on Agrippa's death , Tiberius Nero , that there might be no uncertainty as to the succession . <end>
<start> quo tunc exemplo Tiberius Drusum summae rei admovit , cum incolumi Germanico integrum inter duos iudicium tenuisset . <end>$$<start> However in the beginning of his letter he implored heaven to prosper his plans on behalf of the State , and then added a few remarks , without falsehood or exaggeration , on the character of the young prince . <end>
<start> sed principio litterarum veneratus deos ut consilia sua rei publicae prosperarent , modica de moribus adulescentis neque in falsum aucta rettulit . <end>$$<start> He had , he reminded them , a wife and three children , and his age was the same as that at which he had himself been formerly summoned by the Divine Augustus to undertake this duty . <end>
<start> neque nunc propere sed per octo annos capto experimento , compressis seditionibus , compositis bellis , triumphalem et bis consulem noti laboris participem sumi . <end>$$<start> it was only after an experience of eight years , after having quelled mutinies and settled wars , after a triumph and two consulships , that he was adopted as a partner in trials already familiar to him . <end>
<start> Praeceperant animis orationem patres quo quaesitior adulatio fuit . <end>$$<start> The senators had anticipated this message and hence their flattery was the more elaborate . <end>
<start> nec tamen repertum nisi ut effigies principum , aras deum , templa et arcus aliaque solita censerent , nisi quod Marcus Silanus ex contumelia consulatus honorem principibus petivit dixitque pro sententia ut publicis privatisve monimentis ad memoriam temporum non consulum nomina praecriberentur , sed eorum qui tribuniciam potestatem gererent . <end>$$<start> But they could devise nothing but voting statues of the two princes , shrines to certain deities , temples , arches and the usual routine , except that Marcus Silanus sought to honour the princes by a slur on the consulate , and proposed that on all monuments , public or private , should be inscribed , to mark the date , the names , not of the consuls , but of those who were holding the tribunitian power . <end>
<start> at Quintus Haterius cum eius diei senatus consulta aureis litteris figenda in curia censuisset deridiculo fuit senex foedissimae adulationis tantum infamia usurus . <end>$$<start> Quintus Haterius , when he brought forward a motion that the decrees passed that day should be set up in the Senate House in letters of gold , was laughed at as an old dotard , who would get nothing but infamy out of such utterly loathsome sycophancy . <end>
<start> Inter quae provincia Africa Iunio Blaeso prorogata , Servius Maluginensis flamen Dialis ut Asiam sorte haberet postulavit , frustra vulgatum dictitans non licere Dialibus egredi Italia neque aliud ius suum quam Martialium Quirinaliumque flaminum porro , si hi duxissent provincias , cur Dialibus id vetitum . <end>$$<start> Meantime Junius Blaesus received an extension of his government of Africa , and Servius Maluginensis , the priest of Jupiter , demanded to have Asia allotted to him . <end>
<start> nulla de eo populi scita , non in libris caerimoniarum reperiri . <end>$$<start> If these latter had provinces allotted to them , why was it forbidden to the priests of Jupiter . <end>
<start> saepe pontifices Dialia sacra fecisse si flamen valetudine aut munere publico impediretur . <end>$$<start> There were no resolutions of the people or anything to be found in the books of ceremonies on the subject . <end>
<start> quinque et septuaginta annis post Cornelii Merulae caedem neminem suffectum neque tamen cessavisse religiones . <end>$$<start> Pontiffs had often performed the rites to Jupiter when his priest was hindered by illness or by public duty For seventy-five years after the suicide of Cornelius Merula no successor to his office had been appointed . <end>
<start> quod si per tot annos possit non creari nullo sacrorum damno , quanto facilius afuturum ad unius anni proconsulare imperium . <end>$$<start> If during so many years it was possible for there to be no appointment without any prejudice to religion , with what comparative ease might he be absent for one year's proconsulate . <end>
<start> privatis olim simultatibus effectum ut a pontificibus maximis ire in provincias prohiberentur nunc deum munere summum pontificum etiam summum hominum esse , non aemulationi , non odio aut privatis adfectionibus obnoxium . <end>$$<start> Now , thank heaven , the supreme pontiff was also the supreme man , and was influenced by no rivalry , hatred or personal feeling . <end>
<start> Adversus quae cum augur Lentulus aliique varie dissererent , eo decursum est ut pontificis maximi sententiam opperirentur . <end>$$<start> As the augur Lentulus and others argued on various grounds against this view , the result was that they awaited the decision of the supreme pontiff . <end>
<start> Tiberius dilata notione de iure flaminis decretas ob tribuniciam Drusi potestatem caerimonias temperavit , nominatim arguens insolentiam sententiae aureasque litteras contra patrium morem . <end>$$<start> Letters also from Drusus were read , which , though studiously modest in expression , were taken to be extremely supercilious . <end>
<start> huc decidisse cuncta ut ne iuvenis quidem tanto honore accepto adiret urbis deos , ingrederetur senatum , auspicia saltem gentile apud solum inciperet . <end>$$<start> Why , at this very moment , he is on a tour amid the shores and lakes of Campania . <end>
<start> bellum scilicet aut diverso terrarum distineri , litora et lacus Campaniae cum maxime peragrantem . <end>$$<start> Such is the training of the future ruler of mankind such the lesson he first learns from his father's counsels . <end>
<start> Sed Tiberius , vim principatus sibi firmans , imaginem antiquitatis senatui praebebat postulata provinciarum ad disquisitionem patrum mittendo . <end>$$<start> Tiberius meantime , while securing to himself the substance of imperial power , allowed the Senate some shadow of its old constitution by referring to its investigation certain demands of the provinces . <end>
<start> crebrescebat enim Graecas per urbes licentia atque impunitas asyla statuendi . <end>$$<start> In the Greek cities license and impunity in establishing sanctuaries were on the increase . <end>
<start> complebantur templa pessimis servitiorum . <end>$$<start> Temples were thronged with the vilest of the slaves . <end>
<start> eodem subsidio obaerati adversum creditores suspectique capitalium criminum receptabantur , nec ullum satis validum imperium erat coercendis seditionibus populi flagitia hominum ut caerimonias deum protegentis . <end>$$<start> the same refuge screened the debtor against his creditor , as well as men suspected of capital offences No authority was strong enough to check the turbulence of a people which protected the crimes of men as much as the worship of the gods . <end>
<start> igitur placitum ut mitterent civitates iura atque legatos . <end>$$<start> It was accordingly decided that the different states were to send their charters and envoys to Rome . <end>
<start> et quaedam quod falso usurpaverant sponte omisere . <end>$$<start> Some voluntarily relinquished privileges which they had groundlessly usurped . <end>
<start> multae vetustis superstitionibus aut meritis in populum Romanum fidebant . <end>$$<start> many trusted to old superstitions , or to their services to the Roman people . <end>
<start> magnaque eius diei species fuit quo senatus maiorum beneficia , sociorum pacta , regum etiam qui ante vim Romanam valuerant decreta ipsorumque numinum religiones introspexit , libero , ut quondam , quid firmaret mutaretve . <end>$$<start> It was a grand spectacle on that day , when the Senate examined grants made by our ancestors , treaties with allies , even decrees of kings who had flourished before Rome's ascendancy , and the forms of worship of the very deities , with full liberty as in former days , to ratify or to alter . <end>
<start> Primi omnium Ephesii adiere , memorantes non , ut vulgus crederet , Dianam atque Apollinem Delo genitos esse apud se Cenchreum amnem , lucum Ortygiam , ubi Latonam partu gravidam et oleae , quae tum etiam maneat , adnisam edidisse ea numina , deorumque monitu sacratum nemus , atque ipsum illic Apollinem post interfectos Cyclopas Iovis iram vitavisse . <end>$$<start> First of all came the people of Ephesus They declared that Diana and Apollo were not born at Delos , as was the vulgar belief They had in their own country a river Cenchrius , a grove Ortygia , where Latona , as she leaned in the pangs of labour on an olive still standing , gave birth to those two deities , whereupon the grove at the divine intimation was consecrated . <end>
<start> mox Liberum patrem , bello victorem , supplicibus Amazonum quae aram insiderant ignovisse . <end>$$<start> There Apollo himself , after the slaughter of the Cyclops , shunned the wrath of Jupiter . <end>
<start> auctam hinc concessu Herculis , cum Lydia poteretur , caerimoniam templo neque Persarum dicione deminutum ius . <end>$$<start> there too father Bacchus , when victorious in war , pardoned the suppliant Amazons who had gathered round the shrine . <end>
<start> Proximi hos Magnetes Lucius Scipionis et Lucius Sullae constitutis nitebantur , quorum ille Antiocho , hic Mithridate pulsis fidem atque virtutem Magnetum decoravere , uti Dianae Leucophrynae perfugium inviolabile foret . <end>$$<start> Next the people of Magnesia relied on arrangements made by Lucius Scipio and Lucius Sulla These generals , after respectively defeating Antiochus and Mithridates , honoured the fidelity and courage of the Magnesians by allowing the temple of Diana of the White Brow to be an inviolable sanctuary . <end>
<start> Aphrodisienses posthac et Strationicenses dictatoris Caesaris ob vetusta in partis merita et recens divi Augusti decretum adtulere , laudati quod Parthorum inruptionem nihil mutata in populum Romanum constantia pertulissent . <end>$$<start> Then the people of Aphrodisia produced a decree of the dictator Caesar for their old services to his party , and those of Stratonicea , one lately passed by the Divine Augustus , in which they were commended for having endured the Parthian invasion without wavering in their loyalty to the Roman people . <end>
<start> sed Aphrodisiensium civitas Veneris , Stratonicensium Iovis et Triviae religionem tuebantur . <end>$$<start> Aphrodisia maintained the worship of Venus Stratonicea , that of Jupiter and of Diana of the Cross Ways . <end>
<start> altius Hierocaesarienses exposuere , Persicam apud se Dianam , delubrum rege Cyro dicatum . <end>$$<start> Hierocaesarea went back to a higher antiquity , and spoke of having a Persian Diana , whose fane was consecrated in the reign of Cyrus . <end>
<start> et memorabantur Perpennae , Isaurici multaque alia imperatorum nomina qui non modo templo sed duobus milibus passuum eandem sanctitatem tribuerant . <end>$$<start> They quoted too the names of Perperna , Isauricus , and many other generals who had conceded the same sacred character not only to the temple but to its precincts for two miles . <end>
<start> exim Cyprii tribus de delubris , quorum vetustissimum Paphiae Veneri auctor Aesrias , post filius eius Amathus Veneri Amathusiae et Iovi Salaminio Teucer , Telamonis patris ira profugus , posuissent . <end>$$<start> Then came the Cyprians on behalf of three shrines , the oldest of which had been set up by their founder Aerias to the Paphian Venus , the second by his son Amathus to Venus of Amathus , and the last to Jupiter of Salamis , by Teucer when he fled from the wrath of his father Telamon . <end>
<start> Auditae aliarum quoque civitatium legationem . <end>$$<start> Audience was also given to embassies from other states . <end>
<start> quorum copia fessi patres , et quia studiis certabatur , consulibus permisere ut perspecto iure , et si qua iniquitas involveretur , rem integram rursum ad senatum referrent . <end>$$<start> The senators wearied by their multiplicity and seeing the party spirit that was being roused , intrusted the inquiry to the consuls , who were to sift each title and see if it involved any abuse , and then refer back the entire matter to the Senate . <end>
<start> consules super eas civitates quas memoravi apud Pergamum Aesculapii compertum asylum rettulerunt ceteros obscuris ob vetustatem initiis niti . <end>$$<start> Besides the states already mentioned , the consuls reported that they had ascertained that at Pergamus there was a sanctuary of Aesculapius , but that the rest relied on an origin lost in the obscurity of antiquity . <end>
<start> nam Zmyrnaeos oraculum Apollinis , cuius imperio Stratonicidi Veneri templum dicaverint , Tenios eiusdem carmen referre , quo sacrare Neptuni effigiem aedemque iussi sint . <end>$$<start> For example , the people of Smyrna quoted an oracle of Apollo , which had commanded them to dedicate a temple to Venus Stratonicis . <end>
<start> set cultus numinum utrisque Dianam aut Apollinem venerandi . <end>$$<start> So again Miletus relied on king Darius . <end>
<start> petere et Cretenses simulacro divi Augusti . <end>$$<start> But in each case their religious worship was that of Diana or Apollo . <end>
<start> factaque senatus consulta quis multo cum honore modus tamen praescribebatur . <end>$$<start> The Cretans too demanded a like privilege for a statue of the Divine Augustus . <end>
<start> Sub idem tempus Iuliae Augustae valetudo atrox necessitudinem principi fecit festinati in urbem reditus , sincera adhuc inter matrem filiumque concordia sive occultis odiis . <end>$$<start> About this time Julia Augusta had an alarming illness , which compelled the emperor to hasten his return to Rome , for hitherto there had been a genuine harmony between the mother and son , or a hatred well concealed . <end>
<start> neque enim multo ante , cum haud procul theatro Marcelli effigiem divo Augusto Iulia dicaret , Tiberi nomen suo postscripserat , idque ille credebatur ut inferius maiestate principis gravi et dissimulata offensione abdidisse . <end>$$<start> However the Senate now decreed supplications to the gods and the celebration of the Great Games , which were to be exhibited by the pontiffs , augurs , the colleges of the Fifteen and of the Seven , with the Augustal Brotherhood . <end>
<start> censuerat Lucius Apronius ut fetiales quoque iis ludis praesiderent . <end>$$<start> This the emperor opposed , distinguishing the peculiar privileges of the sacred guilds , and quoting precedents . <end>
<start> Exequi sententias haud institui nisi insignis per honestum aut notabili dedecore , quod praecipuum munus annalium reor ne virtutes sileantur utque pravis dictis factisque ex posteritate et infamia metus sit . <end>$$<start> My purpose is not to relate at length every motion , but only such as were conspicuous for excellence or notorious for infamy . <end>
<start> ceterum tempora illa adeo infecta et adulatione sordida fuere ut non modo primores civitatis , quibus claritudo sua obsequiis protegenda erat , sed omnes consulares , magna pars eorum qui praetura functi multique etiam pedarii senatores certatim exsurgerent foedaque et nimia censerent . <end>$$<start> So corrupted indeed and debased was that age by sycophancy that not only the foremost citizens who were forced to save their grandeur by servility , but every exconsul , most of the ex-praetors and a host of inferior senators would rise in eager rivalry to propose shameful and preposterous motions . <end>
<start> Paulatim dehinc ab indecoris ad infesta transgrediebantur . <end>$$<start> From unseemly flatteries they passed by degrees to savage acts . <end>
<start> Gaius Silanum pro consule Asiae repetundarum a sociis postulatum Mamercus Scaurus e consularibus , Iunius Otho praetor , Bruttedius Niger aedilis simul corripiunt obiectantque violatum Augusti numen , spretam Tiberii maiestatem , Mamercus antiqua exempla iaciens , Lucius Cottam a Scipione Africano , Servium Galbam a Catone censorio , Publius Rutilium a Marcus Scauro accusatos . <end>$$<start> As if indeed Scipio's and Cato's vengeance fell on such offences , or that of the famous Scaurus , whom his great grandson , a blot on his ancestry , this Mamercus was now disgracing by his infamous occupation . <end>
<start> videlicet Scipio et Cato talia ulciscebantur aut ille Scaurus , quem proavum suum obprobrium maiorum Mamercus infami opera dehonestabat . <end>$$<start> Junius Otho's old employment had been the keeping of a preparatory school . <end>
<start> Auxere numerum accusatorum Gellius Publicola et Paconius , ille quaestor Silani , hic legatus . <end>$$<start> Gellius Publicola and Marcus Paconius , respectively quaestor and lieutenant of Silanus , swelled the number of the accusers . <end>
<start> nec dubium habebatur saevitiae captarumque pecuniarum teneri reum sed multa adgerebantur etiam insontibus periculosa , cum super tot senatores adversos facundissimis totius Asiae eoque ad accusandum delectis responderet solus et orandi nescius , proprio in metu qui exercitam quoque eloquentiam debilitat , non temperante Tiberio quin premeret voce vultu , eo quod ipse creberrime interrogabat , neque refellere aut eludere dabatur , ac saepe etiam confitendum erat ne frustra quaesivisset . <end>$$<start> No doubt was felt as to the defendant's conviction for oppression and extortion , but there was a combination against him , that must have been perilous even to an innocent man Besides a host of adverse Senators there were the most accomplished orators of all Asia , who , as such , had been retained for the prosecution , and to these he had to reply alone , without any experience in pleading , and under that personal apprehension which is enough to paralyse even the most practised eloquence . <end>
<start> et ne quis necessariorum iuvaret periclitantem maiestatis crimina subdebantur , vinclum et necessitas silendi . <end>$$<start> And that not a friend might help him in his danger , charges of treason were added , a binding guarantee for sealed lips . <end>
<start> igitur petito paucorum dierum interiectu defensionem sui deseruit , ausis ad Caesarem codicillis quibus invidiam et preces miscuerat . <end>$$<start> Accordingly he begged a few days' respite , and at last abandoned his defence , after venturing on a memorial to the emperor , in which he mingled reproach and entreaty . <end>
<start> Tiberius quae in Silanum parabat quo excusatius sub exemplo acciperentur , libellos divi Augusti de Voleso Messala eiusdem Asiae pro consule factumque in eum senatus consultum recitari iubet . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , that his proceedings against Silanus might find some justification in precedent , ordered the Divine Augustus's indictment of Volesus Messala , also a proconsul of Asia , and the Senate's sentence on him to be read . <end>
<start> tum Lucius Pisonem sententiam rogat . <end>$$<start> He then asked Lucius Piso his opinion . <end>
<start> ille multum de clementia principis praefatus aqua atque igni Silano interdicendum censuit ipsumque in insulam Gyarum relegandum . <end>$$<start> After a long preliminary eulogy on the prince's clemency , Piso pronounced that Silanus ought to be outlawed and banished to the island of Gyarus . <end>
<start> eadem ceteri , nisi quod Gnaeus Lentulus separanda Silani materna bona , quippe Atia parente geniti , reddendaque filio dixit , adnuente Tiberio . <end>$$<start> The rest concurred , with the exception of Cneius Lentulus , who , with the assent of Tiberius , proposed that the property of Silanus's mother , as she was very different from him , should be exempted from confiscation , and given to the son . <end>
<start> At Cornelius Dolabella dum adulationem longius sequitur increpitis Gaius Silani moribus addidit ne quis vita probrosus et opertus infamia provinciam sortiretur , idque princeps diiudicaret . <end>$$<start> Cornelius Dolabella however , by way of carrying flattery yet further , sharply censured the morals of Silanus , and then moved that no one of disgraceful life and notorious infamy should be eligible for a province , and that of this the emperor should be judge . <end>
<start> nam a legibus delicta puniri quanto fore mitius in ipsos , melius in socios , provideri ne peccaretur . <end>$$<start> Laws , indeed , he said , punish crimes committed . <end>
<start> adversum quae disseruit Caesar non quidem sibi ignare quae de Silano vulgabantur , sed non ex rumore statuendum . <end>$$<start> but how much more merciful would it be to individuals , how much better for our allies , to provide against their commission . <end>
<start> multos in provinciis contra quam spes aut metus de illis fuerit egisse excitari quosdam ad meliora magnitudine rerum , hebescere alios . <end>$$<start> The emperor opposed the motion Although , he said , I am not ignorant of the reports about Silanus , still we must decide nothing by hearsay . <end>
<start> neque posse principem sua scientia cuncta complecti neque expedire ut ambitione aliena trahatur . <end>$$<start> Many a man has behaved in a province quite otherwise than was hoped or feared of him . <end>
<start> ideo leges in facta constitui quia futura in incerto sint . <end>$$<start> Some are roused to higher things by great responsibility . <end>
<start> ne verterent sapienter reperta et semper placita satis onerum principibus , satis etiam potentiae . <end>$$<start> Rights are invariably abridged , as despotism increases . <end>
<start> minui iura quotiens gliscat potestas , nec utendum imperio ubi legibus agi possit . <end>$$<start> nor ought we to fall back on imperial authority , when we can have recourse to the laws . <end>
<start> quanto rarior apud Tiberium popularitas tanto laetioribus animis accepta . <end>$$<start> Such constitutional sentiments were so rare with Tiberius , that they were welcomed with all the heartier joy . <end>
<start> atque ille prudens moderandi , si propria ira non impelleretur , addidit insulam Gyarum immitem et sine cultu hominum esse darent Iuniae familiae et viro quondam ordinis eiusdem ut Cythnum potius concederet . <end>$$<start> Knowing , as he did , how to be forbearing , when he was not under the stimulus of personal resentment , he further said that Gyarus was a dreary and uninhabited island , and that , as a concession to the Junian family and to a man of the same order as themselves , they might let him retire by preference to Cythnus . <end>
<start> id sororem quoque Silani Torquatam , priscae sanctimoniae virginem , expetere . <end>$$<start> This , he added , was also the request of Torquata , Silanus's sister , a vestal of primitive purity . <end>
<start> in hanc sententiam facta discessio . <end>$$<start> The motion was carried after a division . <end>
<start> Post auditi Cyrenenses et accusante Anchario Prisco Caesius Cordus repetundarum damnatur . <end>$$<start> Audience was next given to the people of Cyrene , and on the prosecution of Ancharius Priscus , Caesius Cordus was convicted of extortion . <end>
<start> Lucius Ennium equitem Romanum , maiestatis postulatum quod effigiem principis promiscum ad usum argenti vertisset , recipi Caesar inter reos vetuit , palam aspernante Ateio Capitone quasi per libertatem . <end>$$<start> but the emperor forbade his being put upon his trial , though Ateius Capito openly remonstrated , with a show of independence . <end>
<start> non enim debere eripi patribus vim statuendi neque tantum maleficium impune habendum . <end>$$<start> The Senate , he said , ought not to have wrested from it the power of deciding a question , and such a crime must not go unpunished . <end>
<start> intellexit haec Tiberius , ut erant magis quam ut dicebantur , perstititque intercedere . <end>$$<start> Tiberius interpreted the remark according to its drift rather than its mere expression , and persisted in his veto . <end>
<start> Incessit dein religio quonam in templo locandum foret donum quod pro valetudine Augustae equites Romani voverant equestri Fortunae nam etsi delubra eius deae multa in urbe , nullum tamen tali cognomento erat . <end>$$<start> Next came a religious question , as to the temple in which ought to be deposited the offering which the Roman knights had vowed to Fortune of the Knights for the recovery of Augusta . <end>
<start> repertum est aedem esse apud Antium quae sic nuncuparetur , cunctasque caerimonias Italicis in oppidis templaque et numinum effigies iuris atque imperii Romani esse . <end>$$<start> Although that Goddess had several shrines in Rome , there was none with this special designation . <end>
<start> et quoniam de religionibus tractabatur , dilatum nuper responsum adversus Servium Maluginensem flaminem Dialem prompsit Caesar recitavitque decretum pontificum , quotiens valetudo adversa flaminem Dialem incessisset , ut pontificis maximi arbitrio plus quam binoctium abesset , dum ne diebus publici sacrificii neu saepius quam bis eundem in annum . <end>$$<start> As religious questions were under discussion , the emperor now produced his answer to Servius Maluginensis , Jupiter's priest , which he had recently deferred , and read the pontifical decree , prescribing that whenever illness attacked a priest of Jupiter , he might , with the supreme pontiff's permission , be absent more than two nights , provided it was not during the days of public sacrifice or more than twice in the same year . <end>
<start> quae principe Augusto constituta satis ostendebant annuam absentiam et provinciarum administrationem dialibus non concedi . <end>$$<start> This regulation of the emperor Augustus sufficiently proved that a year's absence and a provincial government were not permitted to the priests of Jupiter . <end>
<start> memorabaturque Lucius Metelli pontificis maximi exemplum qui Aulum Postumium flaminem attinuisset . <end>$$<start> There was also cited the precedent of Lucius Metellus , supreme pontiff , who had detained at Rome the priest Aulus Postumius . <end>
<start> ita sors Asiae in eum qui consularium Maluginensi proximus erat conlata . <end>$$<start> And so Asia was allotted to the exconsul next in seniority to Maluginensis . <end>
<start> Isdem diebus Lepidus ab senatu petivit ut basilicam Pauli , Aemilia monimenta , propria pecunia firmaret ornaretque . <end>$$<start> About the same time Lepidus asked the Senate's leave to restore and embellish , at his own expense , the basilica of Paulus , that monument of the Aemilian family . <end>
<start> at Pompei theatrum igne fortuito haustum Caesar extructurum pollicitus est eo quod nemo e familia restaurando sufficeret , manente tamen nomine Pompei . <end>$$<start> Following these examples , Lepidus , though possessed of a moderate fortune , now revived the glory of his ancestors . <end>
<start> neque multo post Caesar , cum Iunium Blaesum pro consule Africae triumphi insignibus attolleret , dare id se dixit honori Seiani , cuius ille avunculus erat . <end>$$<start> The Senate voted Sejanus a statue , which was to be placed in Pompeius's theatre . <end>
<start> Nam Tacfarinas , quamquam saepius depulsus , reparatis per intima Africae auxiliis huc adrogantiae venerat ut legatos ad Tiberium mitteret sedemque ultro sibi atque exercitui suo postularet aut bellum inexplicabile minitaretur . <end>$$<start> Still the career of Blaesus merited such a reward For Tacfarinas , though often driven back , had recruited his resources in the interior of Africa , and had become so insolent as to send envoys to Tiberius , actually demanding a settlement for himself and his army , or else threatening us with an interminable war . <end>
<start> non alias magis sua populique Romani contumelia indoluisse Caesarem ferunt quam quod desertor et praedo hostium more ageret . <end>$$<start> Never , it is said , was the emperor so exasperated by an insult to himself and the Roman people as by a deserter and brigand assuming the character of a belligerent . <end>
<start> ne Spartaco quidem post tot consularium exercituum cladis inultam Italiam urenti , quamquam Sertorii atque Mithridatis ingentibus bellis labaret res publica , datum ut pacto in fidem acciperetur . <end>$$<start> Even Spartacus when he had destroyed so many consular armies and was burning Italy with impunity , though the State was staggering under the tremendous wars of Sertorius and Mithridates , had not the offer of an honourable surrender on stipulated conditions . <end>
<start> nedum pulcherrimo populi Romani fastigio latro Tacfarinas pace et concessione agrorum redimeretur . <end>$$<start> far less , in Rome's most glorious height of power , should a robber like Tacfarinas be bought off by peace and concessions of territory . <end>
<start> dat negotium Blaeso ceteros quidem ad spem proliceret arma sine noxa ponendi , ipsius autem ducis quoquo modo poteretur . <end>$$<start> He intrusted the affair to Blaesus , who was to hold out to the other rebels the prospect of laying down their arms without hurt to themselves , while he was by any means to secure the person of the chief . <end>
<start> mox adversum artes Tacfarinatis haud dissimili modo belligeratum . <end>$$<start> Before long the tactics of Tacfarinas were encountered in a similar fashion . <end>
<start> Nam quia ille robore exercitus impar , furandi melior , pluris per globos incursaret eluderetque et insidias simul temptaret , tres incessus , totidem agmina parantur . <end>$$<start> Unequal to us in solid military strength , but better in a war of surprises , he would attack , would elude pursuit , and still arrange ambuscades with a multitude of detachments . <end>
<start> ex quis Cornelius Scipio legatus praefuit qua praedatio in Leptitanos et suffugia Garamantum . <end>$$<start> And so we prepared three expeditions and as many columns . <end>
<start> alio latere , ne Cirtensium pagi impune traherentur , propriam manum Blaesus filius duxit medio cum delectis , castella et munitiones idoneis locis imponens , dux ipse arta et infensa hostibus cuncta fecerat , quia , quoquo inclinarent , pars aliqua militis Romani in ore , in latere et saepe a tergo erat . <end>$$<start> One of the three under the command of Cornelius Scipio , Blaesus's lieutenant , was to stop the enemy's forays on the Leptitani and his retreat to the Garamantes . <end>
<start> nec , ut mos fuerat , acta aestate retrahit copias aut in hibernaculis veteris provinciae componit , sed ut in limine belli dispositis castellis per expeditos et solitudinum gnaros mutantem mapalia Tacfarinatem proturbabat , donec fratre eius capto regressus est , properantius tamen quam ex utilitate sociorum , relictis per quos resurgeret bellum . <end>$$<start> Tiberius however considered the war as finished , and awarded Blaesus the further distinction of being hailed Imperator by the legions , an ancient honour conferred on generals who for good service to the State were saluted with cheers of joyful enthusiasm by a victorious army . <end>
<start> erantque plures simul imperatores nec super ceterorum aequalitatem . <end>$$<start> Augustus too granted the name to certain persons . <end>
<start> concessit quibusdam et Augustus id vocabulum ac tunc Tiberius Blaeso postremum . <end>$$<start> and now , for the last time , Tiberius gave it to Blaesus . <end>
<start> Obiere eo anno viri inlustres Asinius Saloninus , Marco Agrippa et Pollione Asinio avis , fratre Druso insignis Caesarique progener destinatus , et Capito Ateius , de quo memoravi , principem in civitate locum studiis civilibus adsecutus , sed avo centurione Sullano , patre praetorio . <end>$$<start> Two illustrious men died that year One was Asinius Saloninus , distinguished as the grandson of Marcus Agrippa , and Asinius Pollio , as the brother of Drusus and the intended husband of the emperor's granddaughter . <end>
<start> consulatum ei adceleraverat Augustus ut Labeonem Antistium isdem artibus praecellentem dignatione eius magistratus antiret . <end>$$<start> He was prematurely advanced to the consulship by Augustus , so that he might be raised by the honour of this promotion above Labeo Antistius , a conspicuous member of the same profession . <end>
<start> namque illa aetas duo pacis decora simul tulit sed Labeo incorrupta libertate et ob id fama celebratior , Capitonis obsequium dominantibus magis probabatur . <end>$$<start> That age indeed produced at one time two brilliant ornaments of peace Labeo , because his promotion was confined to the praetorship , gained in public favour through the wrong . <end>
<start> illi quod praeturam intra stetit commendatio ex iniuria , huic quod consulatum adeptus est odium ex invidia oriebatur . <end>$$<start> Capito , in obtaining the consulship , incurred the hatred which grows out of envy . <end>
<start> Gaius Asinio Gaius Antistio consulibus nonus Tiberio annus erat compositae rei publicae , florentis domus (nam Germanici mortem inter prospera ducebat) , cum repente turbare fortuna coepit , saevire ipse aut saevientibus viris praebere . <end>$$<start> THE year when Caius Asinius and Caius Antistius were consuls was the ninth of Tiberius's reign , a period of tranquillity for the State and prosperity for his own house , for he counted Germanicus's death a happy incident . <end>
<start> initium et causa penes Aelium Seianum cohortibus praetoriis praefectum cuius de potentia supra memoravi nunc originem , mores , et quo facinore dominationem raptum ierit expediam . <end>$$<start> Suddenly fortune deranged everything the emperor became a cruel tyrant , as well as an abettor of cruelty in others . <end>
<start> genitus Vulsiniis patre Seio Strabone equite Romano , et prima iuventa Gaium Caesarem divi Augusti nepotem sectatus , non sine rumore Apicio diviti et prodigo stuprum veno dedisse , mox Tiberium variis artibus devinxit adeo ut obscurum adversum alios sibi uni incautum intectumque efficeret , non tam sollertia (quippe isdem artibus victus est) quam deum ira in rem Romanam , cuius pari exitio viguit ceciditque . <end>$$<start> Of this the cause and origin was Aelius Sejanus , commander of the praetorian cohorts , of whose influence I have already spoken I will now fully describe his extraction , his character , and the daring wickedness by which he grasped at power . <end>
<start> sui obtegens , in alios criminator . <end>$$<start> he was as cringing as he was imperious . <end>
<start> iuxta adulatio et superbia . <end>$$<start> before the world he affected humility . <end>
<start> palam compositus pudor , intus summa apiscendi libido , eiusque causa modo largitio et luxus , saepius industria ac vigilantia , haud minus noxiae quotiens parando regno finguntur . <end>$$<start> in his heart he lusted after supremacy , for the sake of which he sometimes lavish and luxurious , but oftener energetic and watchful , qualities quite as mischievous when hypocritically assumed for the attainment of sovereignty . <end>
<start> Vim praefecturae modicam antea intendit , dispersas per urbem cohortis una in castra conducendo , ut simul imperia acciperent numeroque et robore et visu inter se fiducia ipsis , in ceteros metus oreretur . <end>$$<start> He strengthened the hitherto moderate powers of his office by concentrating the cohorts scattered throughout the capital into one camp , so that they might all receive orders at the same moment , and that the sight of their numbers and strength might give confidence to themselves , while it would strike terror into the citizens . <end>
<start> praetendebat lascivire militem diductum si quid subitum ingruat , maiore auxilio pariter subveniri et severius acturos si vallum statuatur procul urbis inlecebris . <end>$$<start> His pretexts were the demoralisation incident to a dispersed soldiery , the greater effectiveness of simultaneous action in the event of a sudden peril , and the stricter discipline which would be insured by the establishment of an encampment at a distance from the temptations of the city . <end>
<start> ut perfecta sunt castra , inrepere paulatim militaris animos adeundo , appellando simul centuriones ac tribunos ipse deligere . <end>$$<start> As soon as the camp was completed , he crept gradually into the affections of the soldiers by mixing with them and addressing them by name , himself selecting the centurions and tribunes . <end>
<start> neque senatorio ambitu abstinebat clientes suos honoribus aut provinciis ornandi , facili Tiberio atque ita prono ut socium laborum non modo in sermonibus , sed apud patres et populum celebraret colique per theatra et fora effigies eius interque principia legionum sineret . <end>$$<start> With the Senate too he sought to ingratiate himself , distinguishing his partisans with offices and provinces , Tiberius readily yielding , and being so biassed that not only in private conversation but before the senators and the people he spoke highly of him as the partner of his toils , and allowed his statues to be honoured in theatres , in forums , and at the head-quarters of our legions . <end>
<start> Ceterum plena Caesarum domus , iuvenis filius , nepotes adulti moram cupitis adferebant . <end>$$<start> There were however obstacles to his ambition in the imperial house with its many princes , a son in youthful manhood and grown-up grandsons . <end>
<start> nam Drusus impatiens aemuli et animo commotior orto forte iurgio intenderat Seiano manus et contra tendentis os verberaverat . <end>$$<start> On considering every plan Sejanus thought his easiest revenge was to turn his attention to Livia , Drusus's wife . <end>
<start> igitur cuncta temptanti promptissimum visum ad uxorem eius Liviam convertere , quae soror Germanici , formae initio aetatis indecorae , mox pulchritudine praecellebat . <end>$$<start> She was a sister of Germanicus , and though she was not handsome as a girl , she became a woman of surpassing beauty . <end>
<start> hanc ut amore incensus adulterio pellexit , et postquam primi flagitii potitus est (neque femina amissa pudicitia alia abnuerit) , ad coniugii spem , consortium regni et necem mariti impulit . <end>$$<start> Pretending an ardent passion for her , he seduced her , and having won his first infamous triumph , and assured that a woman after having parted with her virtue will hesitate at nothing , he lured her on to thoughts of marriage , of a share in sovereignty , and of her husband's destruction . <end>
<start> atque illa , cui avunculus Augustus , socer Tiberius , ex Druso liberi , seque ac maiores et posteros municipali adultero foedabat ut pro honestis et praesentibus flagitiosa et incerta expectaret . <end>$$<start> And she , the niece of Augustus , the daughter-in-law of Tiberius , the mother of children by Drusus , for a provincial paramour , foully disgraced herself , her ancestors , and her descendants , giving up honour and a sure position for prospects as base as they were uncertain . <end>
<start> sumitur in conscientiam Eudemus , amicus ac medicus Liviae , specie artis frequens secretis . <end>$$<start> They took into their confidence Eudemus , Livia's friend and physician , whose profession was a pretext for frequent secret interviews . <end>
<start> pellit domo Seianus uxorem Apicatam , ex qua tres liberos genuerat , ne paelici suspectaretur . <end>$$<start> Sejanus , to avert his mistress's jealousy , divorced his wife Apicata , by whom he had had three children . <end>
<start> sed magnitudo facinoris metum , prolationes , diversa interdum consilia adferebat . <end>$$<start> Still the magnitude of the crime caused fear and delay , and sometimes a conflict of plans . <end>
<start> Interim anni principio Drusus ex Germanici liberis togam virilem sumpsit quaeque fratri eius Neroni decreverat senatus repetita . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile , at the beginning of this year , Drusus , one of the children of Germanicus , assumed the dress of manhood , with a repetition of the honours decreed by the Senate to his brother Nero . <end>
<start> addidit orationem Caesar multa cum laude filii sui quod patria benevolentia in fratris liberos foret . <end>$$<start> The emperor added a speech with warm praise of his son for sharing a father's affection to his brother's children . <end>
<start> nam Drusus , quamquam arduum sit eodem loci potentiam et concordiam esse , aequus adulescentibus aut certe non adversus habebatur . <end>$$<start> Drusus indeed , difficult as it is for power and mutual harmony to exist side by side , had the character of being kindly disposed or at least not unfriendly towards the lads . <end>
<start> exim vetus et saepe simulatum proficiscendi in provincias consilium refertur . <end>$$<start> And now the old plan , so often insincerely broached , of a progress through the provinces , was again discussed . <end>
<start> multitudinem veteranorum praetexebat imperator et dilectibus supplendos exercitus nam voluntarium militem deesse , ac si suppeditet , non eadem virtute ac modestia agere , quia plerumque inopes ac vagi sponte militiam sumant . <end>$$<start> The emperor's pretext was the number of veterans on the eve of discharge and the necessity of fresh levies for the army . <end>
<start> quod mihi quoque exequendum reor , quae tunc Romana copia in armis , qui socii reges , quanto sit angustius imperitatum . <end>$$<start> I too ought , I think , to go through these details , and thus show what forces Rome then had under arms , what kings were our allies , and how much narrower then were the limits of our empire . <end>
<start> Italiam utroque mari duae classes , Misenum apud et Ravennam , proximumque Galliae litus rostratae naves praesidebant , quas Actiaca victoria captas Augustus in oppidum Foroiuliense miserat valido cum remige . <end>$$<start> Italy on both seas was guarded by fleets , at Misenum and at Ravenna , and the contiguous coast of Gaul by ships of war captured in the victory of Actium , and sent by Augustus powerfully manned to the town of Forojulium . <end>
<start> sed praecipuum robur Rhenum iuxta , commune in Germanos Gallosque subsidium , octo legiones erant . <end>$$<start> Spain , lately subjugated , was held by three Mauretania was king Juba's , who had received it as a gift from the Roman people . <end>
<start> at apud idonea provinciarum sociae triremes alaeque et auxilia cohortium , neque multo secus in iis virium sed persequi incertum fuit , cum ex usu temporis huc illuc mearent , gliscerent numero et aliquando minuerentur . <end>$$<start> But any detailed account of them would be misleading , since they moved from place to place as circumstances required , and had their numbers increased and sometimes diminished . <end>
<start> Congruens crediderim recensere ceteras quoque rei publicae partis , quibus modis ad eam diem habitae sint , quoniam Tiberio mutati in deterius principatus initium ille annus attulit . <end>$$<start> It is however , I think , a convenient opportunity for me to review the hitherto prevailing methods of administration in the other departments of the State , inasmuch as that year brought with it the beginning of a change for the worse in Tiberius's policy . <end>
<start> mandabatque honores , nobilitatem maiorum , claritudinem militiae , iniustris domi artes spectando , ut satis constaret non alios potiores fuisse . <end>$$<start> In the first place , public business and the most important private matters were managed by the Senate : the leading men were allowed freedom of discussion , and when they stooped to flattery , the emperor himself checked them . <end>
<start> minorum quoque magistratuum exercita potestas . <end>$$<start> The consul and the praetor retained their prestige . <end>
<start> legesque , si maiestatis quaestio eximeretur , bono in usu . <end>$$<start> inferior magistrates exercised their authority . <end>
<start> at frumenta et pecuniae vectigales , cetera publicorum fructuum societatibus equitum Romanorum agitabantur . <end>$$<start> the laws too , with the single exception of cases of treason , were properly enforced . <end>
<start> res suas Caesar spectatissimo cuique , quibusdam ignotis ex fama mandabat , semelque adsumpti tenebantur prorsus sine modo , cum plerique isdem negotiis insenescereut . <end>$$<start> As to the duties on corn , the indirect taxes and other branches of the public revenue , they were in the hands of companies of Roman knights . <end>
<start> plebes acri quidem annona fatigabatur , sed nulla in eo culpa ex principe quin infecunditati terrarum aut asperis maris obviam iit , quantum impendio diligentiaque poterat . <end>$$<start> The emperor intrusted his own property to men of the most tried integrity or to persons known only by their general reputation , and once appointed they were retained without any limitation , so that most of them grew old in the same employments . <end>
<start> et ne provinciae novis oneribus turbarentur utque vetera sine avaritia aut crudelitate magistratnum tolerarent providebat corporum verbera , ademptiones bonorum aberant . <end>$$<start> The city populace indeed suffered much from high prices , but this was no fault of the emperor , who actually endeavoured to counteract barren soils and stormy seas with every resource of wealth and foresight . <end>
<start> Quae cuncta non quidem comi via sed horridus ac plerumque formidatus retinebat tamen , donec morte Drusi verterentur nam dum superfuit mansere , quia Seianus incipiente adhuc potentia bonis consiliis notescere volebat , et ultor metuebatur non occultus odii set crebro querens ro incolumi filio adiutorem imperii alium vocari . <end>$$<start> The emperor had only a few estates in Italy , slaves on a moderate scale , and his household was confined to a few freedmen If ever he had a dispute with a private person , it was decided in the law courts . <end>
<start> primas dominandi spes in arduo ubi sis ingressus , adesse studia et ministros . <end>$$<start> his statues were to be seen among the monuments of Cneius Pompeius . <end>
<start> extructa iam sponte praefecti castra , datos in manum milites . <end>$$<start> his grandsons would be of the same blood as the family of the Drusi . <end>
<start> cerni effgiem eius in monimentis Gnaeus Pompei . <end>$$<start> Henceforth they must pray that he might have self-control , and so be contented . <end>
<start> communis is illi cum familia Drusorum fore nepotes precandam post haec modestiam ut contentus esset . <end>$$<start> So would Drusus talk , not unfrequently , or only in the hearing of a few persons . <end>
<start> neque raro neque apud paucos talia iaciebat , et secreta quoque eius corrupta uxore prodebantur . <end>$$<start> Even his confidences , now that his wife had been corrupted , were betrayed . <end>
<start> Igitur Seianus maturandum ratus deligit venenum quo paulatim inrepente fortuitus morbus adsimularetur . <end>$$<start> Sejanus accordingly thought that he must be prompt , and chose a poison the gradual working of which might be mistaken for a natural disorder . <end>
<start> id Druso datum per Lygdum spadonem , ut octo post annos cognitum est . <end>$$<start> It was given to Drusus by Lygdus , a eunuch , as was ascertained eight years later . <end>
<start> ceterum Tiberius per omnis valetudinis eius dies , nullo metu an ut firmitudinem animi ostentaret , etiam defuncto necdum sepulto , curiam ingressus est . <end>$$<start> As for Tiberius , he went to the Senate house during the whole time of the prince's illness , either because he was not afraid , or to show his strength of mind , and even in the interval between his death and funeral . <end>
<start> consulesque sede vulgari per speciem maestitiae sedentis honoris locique admonuit , et effusum in lacrimas senatum victo gemitu simul oratione continua erexit non quidem sibi ignarum posse argui quod tam recenti dolore subierit oculos senatus vix propinquorum adloquia tolerari , vix diem aspici a plerisque lugentium . <end>$$<start> Seeing the consuls , in token of their grief , sitting on the ordinary benches , he reminded them of their high office and of their proper place and when the Senate burst into tears , suppressing a groan , he revived their spirits with a fluent speech . <end>
<start> neque illos imbecillitatis damnandos se tamen fortiora solacia e complexu rei publicae petivisse . <end>$$<start> He knew indeed that he might be reproached for thus encountering the gaze of the Senate after so recent an affliction . <end>
<start> miseratusque Augustae extremam senectam , rudem adhuc nepotum et vergentem aetatem suam , ut Germanici liberi , unica praesentium malorum levatnenta , inducerentur petivit . <end>$$<start> Most mourners could hardly bear even the soothing words of kinsfolk or to look on the light of day . <end>
<start> egressi consules firmatos adloquio adulescentulos deductos que ante Caesarem statuunt . <end>$$<start> And such were not to be condemned as weak But he had sought a more manly consolation in the bosom of the commonwealth . <end>
<start> quibus adprensis patres conscripti , hos inquit orbatos parente tradidi patrno ipsorum precatusque sum , quamquam esset illi propria suboles , ne secUs quam snum sanguinem foveret attolleret , sibique et posteris coniormaret . <end>$$<start> Then deploring the extreme age of Augusta , the childhood of his grandsons , and his own declining years , he begged the Senate to summon Germanicus's children , the only comfort under their present misery . <end>
<start> erepto Druso preces ad vos converto disque et patria coram obtestor Augusti pro nepotes , clarissimis maioribus genitos , suscipite regite , vestram meamque vicem explete . <end>$$<start> The consuls went out , and having encouraged the young princes with kind words , brought them in and presented them to the emperor . <end>
<start> ita nati estis ut bona malaque vestra ad rem publicam pertineant . <end>$$<start> Such is your birth that your prosperity and adversity must alike affect the State . <end>
<start> Magno ea fletu et mox precationibus faustis audita . <end>$$<start> There was great weeping at these words , and then many a benediction . <end>
<start> ac si modum orationi posuisset , misericordia sui gloriaque animoi audientium impleverat ad vana et totiens inrisa revolutus , de reddenda re publica utque consules seu quis alius regimen susciperent , vero quoque et honesto fidem dempsit . <end>$$<start> Had the emperor set bounds to his speech , he must have filled the hearts of his hearers with sympathy and admiration But he now fell back on those idle and often ridiculed professions about restoring the republic , and the wish that the consuls or some one else might undertake the government , and thus destroyed belief even in what was genuine and noble . <end>
<start> memoriae Drusi eadem quae in Germanicum decernuntur , plerisque additis , ut ferme amat posterior adulatio . <end>$$<start> The same honours were decreed to the memory of Drusus as to that of Germanicus , and many more were added . <end>
<start> funus imaginum pompa maxime inlustre fuit , cum origo luliae gentis Aeneas omnesque Albanorum reges et conditor urbis Romulus , post Sabina nobilitas , Attus Clausus ceteracque Claudiorum effigies longo ordine spectarentur . <end>$$<start> Such is the way with flattery , when repeated The funeral with its procession of statues was singularly grand Aeneas , the father of the Julian house , all the Alban kings , Romulus , Rome's founder , then the Sabine nobility , Attus Clausus , and the busts of all the other Claudii were displayed in a long train . <end>
<start> In tradenda morte Drusi quae plurimis maximaeque fidei auctoribus memorata sunt rettuli set non omiserim eorundem temporum rumorem validum adeo ut noudum exolescat . <end>$$<start> In relating the death of Drusus I have followed the narrative of most of the best historians . <end>
<start> corrupta ad scelus Livia Seianum Lygdi quoque spadonis animum stupro vinxisse , quod is Lygdus aetate atque forma carus domino interque primores ministros erat . <end>$$<start> But I would not pass over a rumour of the time , the strength of which is not even yet exhausted . <end>
<start> deinde inter conscios ubi locus veneficii tempusque composita sint , eo audaciae provectum ut verteret et occulto indicio Drusum veneni in patrem arguens moneret Tiberium vitandam potionem quae prima ei apud filium epulanti offerretur . <end>$$<start> Sejanus , it is said , having seduced Livia into crime , next secured , by the foulest means , the consent of Lygdus , the eunuch , as from his youth and beauty he was his master's favourite , and one of his principal attendants . <end>
<start> atque illo ignaro et inveniliter hauriente auctam suspicionem , tamquam metu et pudore sibimet inrogaret mortem quam patri struxerat . <end>$$<start> His suspicions were increased when Drusus , in perfect unconsciousness , drank it off with youthful eagerness , apparently , out of fear and shame , bringing on himself the death which he had plotted against his father . <end>
<start> Haec vulgo iactata super id quod nullo auctore certo firmantur prompte refutaveris . <end>$$<start> These popular rumours , over and above the fact that they are not vouched for by any good writer , may be instantly refuted . <end>
<start> quis enim mediocri prudentia , nedum Tiberius tantis rebus exercitus , inaudito filio exitium offerret , idque sua manu et nullo ad pacnitendum regressu . <end>$$<start> For who , with moderate prudence , far less Tiberius with his great experience , would have thrust destruction on a son , without even hearing him , with his own hand too , and with an impossibility of returning to better thoughts . <end>
<start> quin potius ministrum veneni excruciaret , auctorem exquireret , insita denique etiam in extraneos cunctatione et mora adversum unicum et nullius ante flagitii compertum uteretur . <end>$$<start> Surely he would rather have had the slave who handed the poison , tortured , have sought to discover the traitor , in short , would have been as hesitating and tardy in the case of an only son hitherto unconvicted of any crime , as he was naturally even with strangers . <end>
<start> sed quia Seianus facinorum omnium repertor habebatur , ex nimia caritate in eum Caesaris et ceterorum in utrumque odio quamvis fabulosa et immania credebantur , atrociore semper fama erga dominantium exitus . <end>$$<start> But as Sejanus had the credit of contriving every sort of wickedness , the fact that he was the emperor's special favourite , and that both were hated by the rest of the world , procured belief for any monstrous fiction , and rumour too always has a dreadful side in regard to the deaths of men in power . <end>
<start> ordo alioqui sceleris per Apicatam Seiani proditus tormentis Eudemi ac Lygdi patefactus est . <end>$$<start> Besides , the whole process of the crime was betrayed by Apicata , Sejanus's wife , and fully divulged , under torture , by Eudemus and Lygdus . <end>
<start> neque quisquam scriptor tam infensus extitit ut Tiberio obiectaret , cum omnia alia conquirerent intenderentque . <end>$$<start> No writer has been found sufficiently malignant to fix the guilt on Tiberius , though every circumstance was scrutinized and exaggerated . <end>
<start> mihi tradendi arguendique rumoris causa fuit ut claro sub exemplo falsas auditiones depellerem peteremque ab iis quorum in manus cura nostra venerit ne divulgata atque incredibilia avide accepta veris neque in miraculum corruptis antehabeant . <end>$$<start> My object in mentioning and refuting this story is , by a conspicuous example , to put down hearsay , and to request all into whose hands my work shall come , not to catch eagerly at wild and improbable rumours in preference to genuine history which has not been perverted into romance . <end>
<start> Ceterum laudante filium pro rostris Tiberio senatus populusque habitum ac voces dolentum simulatione magis quam libens induebat , domumque Germanici revirescere occulti laetabantur . <end>$$<start> Tiberius pronounced a panegyric on his son before the Rostra , during which the Senate and people , in appearance rather than in heart , put on the expression and accents of sorrow , while they inwardly rejoiced at the brightening future of the family of Germanicus . <end>
<start> nam Seianus ubi videt mortem Drusi inultam interfectoribus , sine maerore publico esse , ferox scelerum et , quia prima provenerant , volutare secum quonam modo Germanici liberos perverteret , quorum non dubia successio . <end>$$<start> There were three , and poison could not be distributed among them , because of the singular fidelity of their guardians and the unassailable virtue of Agrippina . <end>
<start> igitur contumaciam eius insectari , vetus Augustae odium , recentem Liviae conscientiam exagitare , ut superbam fecunditate , subnixam popularibus studiis inhiare dominationi apud Caesarem arguerent . <end>$$<start> Livia availed herself of the cunning of accusers , among whom she had selected Julius Postumus , a man well suited to her purpose , as he had an intrigue with Mutilia Prisca , and was consequently in the confidence of Augusta , over whose mind Prisca had great influence . <end>
<start> atque haec callidis criminatoribus , inter quos delegerat Iulium Postumum , per adulterium Mutiliae Priscae inter intimos aviae et consiliis suis peridoneum , quia Prisca in animo Augustae valida anum suapte natura potentiae anxiam insociabilem nurui efficiebat . <end>$$<start> She thus made her aged grandmother , whose nature it was to tremble for her power , irreconcilably hostile to her grandson's widow . <end>
<start> At Tiberius nihil intermissa rerum cura , negotia pro solaciis accipiens , ius civium , preces sociorum tractabat . <end>$$<start> Tiberius meanwhile , who did not relax his attention to business , and found solace in his work , occupied himself with the causes of citizens at Rome and with petitions from allies . <end>
<start> factaque auctore eo senatus consulta ut civitati Cibyraticae apud Asiam , Aegiensi apud Achaiam , motu terrae labefactis , subveniretur remissione tributi in triennium . <end>$$<start> Decrees of the Senate were passed at his proposal for relieving the cities of Cibyra and Aegium in Asia and Achaia , which had suffered from earthquakes , by a remission of three years' tribute . <end>
<start> et Vibius Serenus pro consule ulterioris Hispaniae de vi publica damnatus ob atrocitatem morum in insulam Amorgum deportatur . <end>$$<start> Vibius Serenus too , proconsul of Further Spain , was condemned for violence in his official capacity , and was banished to the island of Amorgus for his savage temper . <end>
<start> Carsidius Sacerdos , reus tamquam frumento hostem Tacfarinatem iuvisset , absolvitur , eiusdemque criminis Gaius Gracchus . <end>$$<start> Carsidius Sacerdos , accused of having helped our enemy Tacfarinas with supplies of grain , was acquitted , as was also Caius Gracchus on the same charge . <end>
<start> hunc comitem exilii admodum infantem pater Sempronius in insulam Cercinam tulerat . <end>$$<start> Gracchus's father , Sempronius , had taken him when a mere child to the island of Cercina to be his companion in exile . <end>
<start> illic adultus inter extorris et liberalium artium nescios , mox per Africam ac Siciliam mutando sordidas merces sustentabatur . <end>$$<start> There he grew up among outcasts who knew nothing of a liberal education , and after a while supported himself in Africa and Sicily by petty trade . <end>
<start> neque tamen effugit magnae fortunae pericula . <end>$$<start> But he did not escape the dangers of high rank . <end>
<start> ac ni Aelius Lamia et Lucius Apronius qui Africam obtinuerant insontem protexissent , claritudine infausti generis et paternis s adversis foret abstractus . <end>$$<start> Had not his innocence been protected by Aelius Lamia and Lucius Apronius , successive governors of Africa , the splendid fame of that ill-starred family and the downfall of his father would have dragged him to ruin . <end>
<start> Is quoque annus legationes Graecarum civitatium habuit , Samiis Iunonis , Cois Aesculapii delubro vetustum asyli ius ut firmaretur petentibus . <end>$$<start> This year too brought embassies from the Greek communities The people of Samos and Cos petitioned for the confirmation of the ancient right of sanctuary for the respective temples of Juno and Aesculapius . <end>
<start> Samii decreto Amphictyonum nitebantur , quis praecipuum fuit rerum omnium iudicium , qua tempestate Graeci conditis per Asiam urbibus ora maris potiebantur . <end>$$<start> The Samians relied on a decree of the Amphictyonic Council , which had the supreme decision of all questions when the Greeks , through the cities they had founded in Asia , had possession of the sea-coast . <end>
<start> neque dispar apud Coos antiquitas , et accedebat meritum ex loco nam civis Romanos templo Aesculapii induxerant , cum iussu regis Mithridatis apud cunctas Asiae insulas et urbes trucidarentur . <end>$$<start> Cos could boast equal antiquity , and it had an additional claim connected with the place Roman citizens had been admitted to the temple of Aesculapius , when king Mithridates ordered a general massacre of them throughout all the islands and cities of Asia . <end>
<start> variis dehinc et saepius inritis praetorum questibus , postremo Caesar de immodestia histrionum rettulit multa ab iis in publicum seditiose , foeda per domos temptari . <end>$$<start> Next , after various and usually fruitless complaints from the praetors , the emperor finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behaviour of the players . <end>
<start> pulsi tum histriones Italia . <end>$$<start> The players , upon this , were banished from Italy . <end>
<start> Idem annus alio quoque luctu Caesarem adficit alterum ex geminis Drusi liberis extinguendo , neque minus morte amici . <end>$$<start> That same year also brought fresh sorrow to the emperor by being fatal to one of the twin sons of Drusus , equally too by the death of an intimate friend . <end>
<start> is fuit Lucilius Longus , omnium illi tristium laetorumque socius unusque e senatoribus Rhodii secessus comes . <end>$$<start> This was Lucilius Longus , the partner of all his griefs and joys , the only senator who had been the companion of his retirement in Rhodes . <end>
<start> ita quamquam novo homini censorium funus , effigiem apud forum Augusti publica pecunia patres decrevere , apud quos etiam tum cuncta tractabantur , adeo ut procurator Asiae Lucilius Capito accusante provincia causam dixerit , magna cum adseveratione principis non se ius nisi in servitia et pecunias familiares dedisse quod si vim praetoris usurpasset manibusque militum usus foret , spreta in eo mandata sua audirent socios . <end>$$<start> And so , though he was a man of humble origin , the Senate decreed him a censor's funeral and a statue in the forum of Augustus at the public expense Everything indeed was as yet in the hands of the Senate , and consequently Lucilius Capito , procurator of Asia , who was impeached by his province , was tried by them , the emperor vehemently asserting that he had merely given the man authority over the slaves and property of the imperial establishments . <end>
<start> egitque Nero grates ea causa patribus atque avo , laetas inter audientium adfectiones qui recenti memoria Germanici illum aspici , illum audiri rebantur . <end>$$<start> Nero thanked the Senators and his grandfather on their behalf and carried with him the joyful sympathies of his audience , who , with the memory of Germanicus fresh in their minds , imagined that it was his face they saw , his voice they heard . <end>
<start> aderantque iuveni modestia ac forma principe viro digna , notis in eum Seiani odiis ob periculum gratiora . <end>$$<start> The youth too had a modesty and a grace of person worthy of a prince , the more charming because of his peril from the notorious enmity of Sejanus . <end>
<start> Sub idem tempus de flamine Diali in locum Servi Maluginensis defuncti legendo , simul roganda nova lege disseruit Caesar . <end>$$<start> About the same time the emperor spoke on the subject of electing a priest of Jupiter in the room of Servius Maluginensis , deceased , and of the enactment of a new law . <end>
<start> nam patricios confarrc atis parentibus genitos tres simul nominari , ex quis unus legeretur , vetusto more . <end>$$<start> It was , he said , the old custom to nominate together three patricians , sons of parents wedded according to the primitive ceremony , and of these one was to be chosen . <end>
<start> neque adesse , ut olim , eam copiam , omissa confarreandi adsuetudine aut inter paucos retenta (pluresque eius rei causas adferebat , potissimam penes incuriam virorum feminarumque . <end>$$<start> Now however there was not the same choice as formerly , the primitive form of marriage having been given up or being observed only by a few persons . <end>
<start> accedere ipsius caerimoniae difltcultates quae consulto vitarentur) et quoniam exiret e iure patrio qui id flamonium apisceretur quaeque in manum flaminis conveniret . <end>$$<start> For this he assigned several reasons , the chief being men's and women's indifference . <end>
<start> ita medendum senatus decreto aut lege , sicut Augustus quaedam ex horrida illa antiquitate ad praescentem usum flexisset . <end>$$<start> then , again , the ceremony itself had its difficulties , which were purposely avoided . <end>
<start> igitur tractatis religionibus placitum instituto flaminum nihil demutari sed lata lex qua flaminica Dialis sacrorum causa in potestate viri , cetera promisco feminarum iure ageret . <end>$$<start> and there was the objection that the man who obtained this priesthood was emancipated from the father's authority , as also was his wife , as passing into the husband's control . <end>
<start> Cornelio Cethego Visellio Varrone consulibus pontifices eorumque exemplo ceteri sacerdotes , cum pro incolumitate principis vota susciperent , Neronem quoque et Drusum isdem dis commendavere , non tam caritate iuvenum quam adulatione , quae moribus corruptis perinde anceps , si nulla et ubi nimia est . <end>$$<start> In the consulship of Cornelius Cethegus and Visellius Varro , the pontiffs , whose example was followed by the other priests in offering prayers for the emperor's health , commended also Nero and Drusus to the same deities , not so much out of love for the young princes as out of sycophancy , the absence and excess of which in a corrupt age are alike dangerous . <end>
<start> nam Tiberius haud umquam domui Germanici mitis , tum vero aequari adulescentes senectae suae impatienter indoluit accitosque pontifices percontatus est num id precibus Agrippinae aut minis tribuissent . <end>$$<start> Tiberius indeed , who was never friendly to the house of Germanicus , was then vexed beyond endurance at their youth being honoured equally with his declining years . <end>
<start> instabat quippe Seianus incusabatque diductam civitatem ut civili bello esse qui se partium Agrippinae vocent , ac ni resistatur , fore pluris . <end>$$<start> There were those , he said , who called themselves the party of Agrippina , and , unless they were checked , there would be more . <end>
<start> neque aliud gliscentis discordiae remedium quam si unus alterve maxime prompti subverterentur . <end>$$<start> the only remedy for the increasing discord was the overthrow of one or two of the most enterprising leaders . <end>
<start> Qua causa Gaius Silium et Titium Sabinum adgreditur . <end>$$<start> Accordingly he attacked Caius Silius and Titius Sabinus . <end>
<start> amicitia Germanici perniciosa utrique , Silio et quod ingentis exercitus septem per annos moderator partisque apud Germaniam triumphalibus Sacroviriani belli victor , quanto maiore mole procideret , plus formidinis in alios dispergebatur . <end>$$<start> The friendship of Germanicus was fatal to both As for Silius , his having commanded a great army for seven years , and won in Germany the distinctions of a triumph for his success in the war with Sacrovir , would make his downfall all the more tremendous and so spread greater terror among others . <end>
<start> credebant plerique auctam offensionem ipsius intemperantia , immodice iactantis snum militem in obsequio duravisse cum alii ad seditiones prolaberentur . <end>$$<start> Many thought that he had provoked further displeasure by his own presumption and his extravagant boasts that his troops had been steadfastly loyal , while other armies were falling into mutiny , and that Tiberius's throne could not have lasted had his legions too been bent on revolution . <end>
<start> neque mansurum Tiberio imperium si iis quoque legionibus cupido novandi fuisset . <end>$$<start> All this the emperor regarded as undermining his own power , which seemed to be unequal to the burden of such an obligation . <end>
<start> destrui per haec fortunam suam Caesar imparemque tanto merito rebatur . <end>$$<start> For benefits received are a delight to us as long as we think we can requite them . <end>
<start> nam beneficia eo usque laeta sunt dum videntur exolvi posse ubi multum antevenere pro gratia odium redditur . <end>$$<start> when that possibility is far exceeded , they are repaid with hatred instead of gratitude . <end>
<start> Erat uxor Silio Sosia Galla , caritate Agrippinae invisa principi . <end>$$<start> Silius had a wife , Sosia Galla , whose love of Agrippina made her hateful to the emperor . <end>
<start> hos corripi dilato ad tempus Sabino placitum , immissusque Varro consul qui patennas inimicitias obtendens odiis Seiani per dedecus suum gratifcabatur . <end>$$<start> Varro , the consul , was let loose on them , who , under colour of a hereditary feud , humoured the malignity of Sejanus to his own disgrace . <end>
<start> precante reo brevem moram , dum accusator consulatu abiret , adversatus est Caesar solitum quippe magistratibus diem privatis dicere nec infringendum consulis ius , cuius vigiliis niteretur ne quod res publica detrimentum caperet . <end>$$<start> The accused begged a brief respite , until the prosecutor's consulship expired , but the emperor opposed the request . <end>
<start> igitur multa adseveratione , quasi aut legibus cum Silio ageretur aut Varro consul aut illud res publica esset , coguntur patres , silente reo , vel si defensionem coeptaret , non occultante cuius ira premeretur . <end>$$<start> A long concealed complicity in Sacrovir's rebellion , a rapacity which sullied his victory , and his wife Sosia's conduct , were alleged against him . <end>
<start> conscientia belli Sacrovir diu dissimulatus , victoria per avaritiam foedata et uxor socia arguebantur . <end>$$<start> Unquestionably , they could not extricate themselves from the charge of extortion . <end>
<start> nec dubie repetundarum criminibus haerebant , sed cuncta quaestione maiestatis exercita , et Silius imminentem damnationem voluntario fine praevertit . <end>$$<start> The whole affair however was conducted as a trial for treason , and Silius forestalled impending doom by a self-inflicted death . <end>
<start> Saevitum tamen in bona , non ut stipendiariis pecuniae redderentur , quorum nemo repetebat , sed liberalitas Augusti avulsa , computatis singillatim quae fisco petebantur . <end>$$<start> Yet there was a merciless confiscation of his property , though not to refund their money to the provincials , none of whom pressed any demand . <end>
<start> Sosia in exilium pellitur Asinii Galli sententia , qui partem bonorum publicandam , pars ut liberis relinqueretur censuerat . <end>$$<start> Sosia was banished on the motion of Asinius Gallus , who had proposed that half her estate should be confiscated , half left to the children . <end>
<start> Lepidus quartam accusatoribus secundum necessitudinem legis , cetera liberis concessit . <end>$$<start> This Lepidus , I am satisfied , was for that age a wise and high-principled man . <end>
<start> hunc ego Lepidum temporibus illis gravem et sapientem virum fuisse comperior nam pleraque ab saevis adulationibus aliorum in melius flexit . <end>$$<start> Many a cruel suggestion made by the flattery of others he changed for the better , and yet he did not want tact , seeing that he always enjoyed an uniform prestige , and also the favour of Tiberius . <end>
<start> unde dubitare cogor fato et sorte nascendi , ut cetera , ita principum inclinatio in hos , offensio in illos , an sit aliquid in nostris consiliis liceatque inter abruptam contumaciam et deforme obsequium pergere iter ambitione ac periculis vacuum . <end>$$<start> so that it is possible to pursue a course between a defiant independence and a debasing servility , free from ambition and its perils . <end>
<start> at Messalinus Cotta haud minus claris maioribus sed animo diversus censuit cavendum senatus consulto , ut quamquam insontes magistratus et culpae alienae nescii provincialibus uxorum criminibus proinde quam suis plecterentur . <end>$$<start> Messalinus Cotta , of equally illustrious ancestry as Lepidus , but wholly different in disposition , proposed that the Senate should pass a decree providing that even innocent governors who knew nothing of the delinquencies of others should be punished for their wives' offences in the provinces as much as for their own . <end>
<start> Actum dehinc de Calpurnio Pisone , nobili ac feroci viro . <end>$$<start> Proceedings were then taken against Calpurnius Piso , a high-spirited nobleman . <end>
<start> is namque , ut rettuli , cessurum se urbe ob factines accusatorum in senatu clamitaverat et spreta potentia Augustae trahere in ius Vrgulaniam domoque principis excire ausus erat . <end>$$<start> Tiberius submitted to this at the time not ungraciously , but the remembrance of it was vividly impressed on a mind which brooded over its resentments , even though the first impulse of his displeasure had subsided . <end>
<start> quae in praesens Tiberius civiliter habuit sed in animo revolvente iras , etiam si impetus offensionis languerat , memoria valebat . <end>$$<start> Quintus Granius accused Piso of secret treasonable conversation , and added that he kept poison in his house and wore a dagger whenever he came into the Senate . <end>
<start> Per idem tempus Plautius Silvanus praetor incertis causis Aproniam coniugem in praeceps iecit , tractusque ad Caesarem ab Lucius Apronio socero turbata mente respondit , tamquam ipse somno gravis atque eo ignarus , et uxor sponte mortem sumpsisset . <end>$$<start> About the same time Plautius Silvanus , the praetor , for unknown reasons , threw his wife Apronia out of a window When summoned before the emperor by Lucius Apronius , his father-in-law , he replied incoherently , representing that he was in a sound sleep and consequently knew nothing , and that his wife had chosen to destroy herself . <end>
<start> non cunctanter Tiberius pergit in domum , visit cubiculum , in quo reluctantis et impulsae vestigia cernebantur . <end>$$<start> Without a moment's delay Tiberius went to the house and inspected the chamber , where were seen the marks of her struggling and of her forcible ejection . <end>
<start> refert ad senatum , datisque iudicibus Vrgulania Silvani avia pugionem nepoti misit . <end>$$<start> He reported this to the Senate , and as soon as judges had been appointed , Urgulania , the grandmother of Silvanus , sent her grandson a dagger . <end>
<start> quod perinde creditum quasi principis monitu ob amicitiam Augustae cum Vrgulania . <end>$$<start> This was thought equivalent to a hint from the emperor , because of the known intimacy between Augusta and Urgulania . <end>
<start> reus frustra temptato ferro venas praebuit exolvendas . <end>$$<start> The accused tried the steel in vain , and then allowed his veins to be opened . <end>
<start> mox Numantina , prior uxor eius , accusata iniecisse carminibus et veneficiis vaecordiam marito , insons iudicatur . <end>$$<start> Shortly afterwards Numantina , his former wife , was charged with having caused her husband's insanity by magical incantations and potions , but she was acquitted . <end>
<start> Is demum annus populum Pomanum longo adversum Numidam Tacfarinatem beilo absolvit . <end>$$<start> This year at last released Rome from her long contest with the Numidian Tacfarinas . <end>
<start> nam priores duces , ubi impetrando triumphalium insigni sufficere res suas crediderant , hostem omittebant . <end>$$<start> Former generals , when they thought that their successes were enough to insure them triumphal distinctions , left the enemy to himself . <end>
<start> iamque tres laureatae in urbe statuae et adhuc raptabat Africam Tacfarinas , auctus Maurorum auxiliis qui , Ptolemaeo Iubae filio inventa incurioso , libertos regios et servilia imperia bello mutaverant . <end>$$<start> There were now in Rome three laurelled statues , and yet Tacfarinas was still ravaging Africa , strengthened by reinforcements from the Moors , who , under the boyish and careless rule of Ptolemaeus , Juba's son , had chosen war in preference to the despotism of freedmen and slaves . <end>
<start> erat illi praedarum receptor ac socius populandi rex Garamantum , non ut cum exercitu incederet , sed missis levibus copiis quae ex longinquo in maius audiebantur . <end>$$<start> He had the king of the Garamantes to receive his plunder and to be the partner of his raids , not indeed with a regular army , but with detachments of light troops whose strength , as they came from a distance , rumour exaggerated . <end>
<start> ipsaque e provincia ut quis fortunae inops , moribus turbidus , promptius ruebant , quia Caesar post res a Blaeso gestas quasi nullis iam in Africa hostibus reportari nonam legionem iusserat , nec pro consule eius anni Publius Dolabella retinere ausus erat iussa principis magis quam incerta belli metuens . <end>$$<start> From the province itself every needy and restless adventurer hurried to join him , for the emperor , as if not an enemy remained in Africa after the achievements of Blaesus , had ordered the ninth legion home , and Publius Dolabella , proconsul that year , had not dared to retain it , because he feared the sovereign's orders more than the risks of war . <end>
<start> Igitur Tacfarinas disperso rumore rem Romanam aliis quoque ab nationibus lacerari eoque paulatim Africa decedere , ac posse reliquos circumveniri , si cuncti quibus libertas servitio potior incubuissent , auget viris positisque castris Thubuscum oppidum circumsidet . <end>$$<start> Tacfarinas accordingly spread rumours that elsewhere also nations were rending the empire of Rome and that therefore her soldiers were gradually retiring from Africa , and that the rest might be cut off by a strong effort on the part of all who loved freedom more than slavery . <end>
<start> at Dolabella contracto quod erat militum , terrore nominis Romani et quia Numidae peditum aciem ferre nequeunt , primo sui incessu solvit obsidium locorumque opportuna permunivit . <end>$$<start> He thus augmented his force , and having formed a camp , he besieged the town of Thubuscum . <end>
<start> dein quia pluribus adversum Tacfarinatem expeditionibus cognitum non gravi nec uno incursu consectandum hostem vagum , excito cum popularibus rege Ptolemaeo quattuor agmina parat , quae legatis aut tribunis data . <end>$$<start> Next , as several expeditions against Tacfarinas had proved the uselessness of following up the enemy's desultory movements with the attack of heavy troops from a single point , he summoned to his aid king Ptolemaeus and his people , and equipped four columns , under the command of his lieutenants and tribunes . <end>
<start> et praedatorias manus delecti Maurorum duxere ipse consultor aderat omnibus . <end>$$<start> Marauding parties were also led by picked Moors , Dolabella in person directing every operation . <end>
<start> Nec multo post adfertur Numidas apud castellum semirutum , ab ipsis quondam incensum , cui nomen Auzea , positis mapalibus consedisse , fisos loco quia vastis circum saltibus claudebatur . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards news came that the Numidians had fixed their tents and encamped near a half-demolished fortress , by name Auzea , to which they had themselves formerly set fire , and on the position of which they relied , as it was inclosed by vast forests . <end>
<start> simulque coeptus dies et concentu tubarum ac truci clamore aderant semisomnos in barbaros , pracpeditis Numidarum equis aut diversos pastus pererrantibus . <end>$$<start> Immediately the light infantry and cavalry , without knowing whither they were being led , were hurried along at quick march . <end>
<start> ab Romanis confertus pedes , dispositae turmae , cuncta proelio provisa hostibus contra omnium nesciis non arma , non ordo , non consilium , sed pecorum modo trahi occidi capi . <end>$$<start> Day dawned , and with the sound of trumpets and fierce shouts , they were on the half-asleep barbarians , whose horses were tethered or roaming over distant pastures . <end>
<start> differtur per manipulos , Tacfarinatem omnes notum tot proeliis consectentur non nisi duce interfecto requiem belli fore . <end>$$<start> The infuriated soldiers , remembering their hardships and how often the longed-for conflict had been eluded , sated themselves to a man with vengeance and bloodshed . <end>
<start> at ille deiectis circum stipatoribus vinctoque iam filio et effusis undique Romanis ruendo in tela captivitatem haud inulta morte effugit . <end>$$<start> The word went through the companies that all were to aim at securing Tacfarinas , whom , after so many battles , they knew well , as there would be no rest from war except by the destruction of the enemy's leader . <end>
<start> Dolabellae petenti abnuit triumphalia Tiberius , Seiano tribuens , ne Blaesi avunculi eius laus obsolesceret . <end>$$<start> This ended the war Dolabella asked for triumphal distinctions , but was refused by Tiberius , out of compliment to Sejanus , the glory of whose uncle Blaesus he did not wish to be forgotten . <end>
<start> sed neque Blaesus ideo inlustrior et huic negatus honor gloriam intendit quippe minore exercitu insignis captivos , caedem ducis bellique confecti famam deportarat . <end>$$<start> He had , in fact , with a smaller army , brought back with him illustrious prisoners and the fame of having slain the enemy's leader and terminated the war . <end>
<start> sequebantur et Garamantum legati , raro in urbe visi , quos Tacfarinate caeso perculsa gens set culpae nescia ad satis faciendum populo Romano miserat . <end>$$<start> In his train were envoys from the Garamantes , a rare spectacle in Rome The nation , in its terror at the destruction of Tacfarinas , and innocent of any guilty intention , had sent them to crave pardon of the Roman people . <end>
<start> Eadem aestate mota per Italiam servilis belli semina fors oppressit . <end>$$<start> The same summer , the germs of a slave war in Italy were crushed by a fortunate accident . <end>
<start> auctor tumultus Titus Curtisius , quondam praetoriae cohortis miles , primo coetibus clandestinis apud Brundisium et circumiecta oppida , mox positis propalam libellis ad libertatem vocabat agrestia per longinquos saltus et ferocia servitia , cum velut munere deum tres biremes adpulere ad usus commeantium illo mari . <end>$$<start> By divine providence , three vessels came to land for the use of those who traversed that sea In the same part of the country too was Curtius Lupus , the quaestor , who , according to ancient precedent , had had the charge of the woodland pastures assigned to him . <end>
<start> missusque a Caesare propere Staius tribunus cum valida manu ducem ipsum et proximos audacia in urbem traxit , lam trepidam ob multitudinem familiarum quae gliscebat immensum , minore in dies plebe ingenua . <end>$$<start> The emperor at once sent Staius , a tribune , with a strong detachment , by whom the ringleader himself , with his most daring followers , were brought prisoners to Rome where men already trembled at the vast scale of the slave-establishments , in which there was an immense growth , while the freeborn populace daily decreased . <end>
<start> Isdem consulibus miseriarum ac saevitiae exemplum atrox , reus pater , accusator filius (nomen utrique Vibius Serenus) in senatum inducti sunt . <end>$$<start> That same consulship witnessed a horrible instance of misery and brutality . <end>
<start> ab exilio retractus inluvieque ac squalore obsitus et tum catena vinctus pater oranti filio comparatur . <end>$$<start> A father as defendant , a son as prosecutor , (Vibius Serenus was the name of both) were brought before the Senate . <end>
<start> adulescens multis munditiis , alacri vultu , structas principi insidias , missos in Galliam concitores belli index idem et testis dicebat , adnectebatque Caecilium Comutum praetorium ministravisse pecuniam . <end>$$<start> the father , dragged from exile in filth and squalor now stood in irons , while the son pleaded for his guilt . <end>
<start> at contra reus nihil infracto animo obversus in filium quatere vincla , vocare ultores deos ut sibi quidem redderent exilium ubi procul tali more ageret , filium autem quandoque supplicia sequerentur . <end>$$<start> But the accused with fearless spirit , looked his son in the face , shook his chains , and appealed to the vengeance of the gods , with a prayer that they would restore him to his exile , where he might live far away from such practices , and that , as for his son , punishment might sooner or later overtake him . <end>
<start> idque facile intellectu si proderentur alii non enim se caedem principis et res novas uno socio cogitasse . <end>$$<start> for he never would have plotted the emperor's murder and a revolution with only one confederate . <end>
<start> Tum accusator Gnaeus Lentulum et Seium Tuberonem nominat , magno pudore Caesaris , cum primores civitatis , intimi ipsius amici , Lentulus senectutis extremae , Tubero defecto corpore , tumultus hostilis et turbandae rei publicae accerserentur . <end>$$<start> Upon this the prosecutor named Cneius Lentulus and Seius Tubero , to the great confusion of the emperor , at finding a hostile rebellion and disturbance of the public peace charged on two leading men in the state , his own intimate friends , the first of whom was in extreme old age and the second in very feeble health . <end>
<start> sed hi quidem statim exempti in patrem ex servis quaesitum et quaestio adversa accusatori fuit . <end>$$<start> They were , however , at once acquitted As for the father , his slaves were examined by torture , and the result was unfavourable to the accuser . <end>
<start> qui scelere vaecors , simul vulgi rumore territus robur et saxum aut parricidarum poenas minitantium , cessit urbe . <end>$$<start> The man , maddened by remorse , and terror-stricken by the popular voice , which menaced him with the dungeon , the rock , or a parricide's doom , fled from Rome . <end>
<start> ac retractus Ravenna exequi accusationem adigitur , non occultante Tiberio vetus odium adversum exulem Serenum . <end>$$<start> He was dragged back from Ravenna , and forced to go through the prosecution , during which Tiberius did not disguise the old grudge he bore the exile Serenus . <end>
<start> nam post damnatum Libonem missis ad Caesarem litteris exprobraverat suum tantum studium sine fructu fuisse , addideratque quaedam contumacius quam tutum apud auris superbas et offensioni proniores . <end>$$<start> For after Libo's conviction , Serenus had sent the emperor a letter , upbraiding him for not having rewarded his special zeal in that trial , with further hints more insolent than could be safely trusted to the easily offended ears of a despot . <end>
<start> ea Caesar octo post annos rettulit , medium tempus varie arguens , etiam si tormenta pervicacia servorum contra evenissent . <end>$$<start> All this Tiberius revived eight years later , charging on him various misconduct during that interval , even though the examination by torture , owing to the obstinacy of the slaves , had contradicted his guilt . <end>
<start> Dictis dein sententiis ut Serenus more maiorum puniretur , quo molliret invidiam , intercessit . <end>$$<start> The Senate then gave their votes that Serenus should be punished according to ancient precedent , when the emperor , to soften the odium of the affair , interposed with his veto . <end>
<start> et quia Cornutus sua manu ceciderat , actum de praemiis accusatorum abolendis , si quis maiestatis postulatus ante perfectum iudicium se ipse vita privavisset . <end>$$<start> The motion was on the point of being carried when the emperor , with a harshness contrary to his manner , spoke openly for the informers , complaining that the laws would be ineffective , and the State brought to the verge of ruin . <end>
<start> nec occultum est , quando ex veritate , quando adumbrata laetitia facta imperatorum celebrentur . <end>$$<start> He did not indeed err from dulness , and it is easy to see when the acts of a sovereign meet with genuine , and when with fictitious popularity . <end>
<start> quin ipse , compositus alias et velut eluctantium verborum , solutius promptiusque eloquebatur quotiens subveniret . <end>$$<start> And even he himself , though usually artificial in manner , and though his words escaped him with a seeming struggle , spoke out freely and fluently whenever he came to a man's rescue . <end>
<start> at Publius Suillium quaestorem quondam Germanici , cum Italia arceretur convictus pecuniam ob rem iudicandam cepisse , amovendum in insulam censuit , tanta contentione animi ut iure iurando obstringeret e re publica id esse . <end>$$<start> In another case , that of Publius Suillius , formerly quaestor to Germanicus , who was to be expelled from Italy on a conviction of having received money for a judicial decision , he held that the man ought to be banished to an island , and so intensely strong was his feeling that he bound the Senate by an oath that this was a State necessity . <end>
<start> quod aspere acceptum ad praesens mox in laudem vertit regresso Suillio . <end>$$<start> The act was thought cruel at the moment , but subsequently it redounded to his honour when Suillius returned from exile . <end>
<start> quem vidit sequens aetas praepotentem , venalem et Claudii principis amicitia diu prospere , numquam bene usum . <end>$$<start> The next age saw him in tremendous power and a venal creature of the emperor Claudius , whose friendship he long used , with success , never for good . <end>
<start> eadem poena in Catum Firmium senatorem statuitur , tamquam falsis maiestatis criminibus sororem petivisset . <end>$$<start> The same punishment was adjudged to Catus Firmius , a Senator , for having (it was alleged) assailed his sister with a false charge of treason . <end>
<start> Catus , ut rettuli , Libonem inlexerat insidiis , deinde indicio perculerat . <end>$$<start> Catus , as I have related , had drawn Libo into a snare and then destroyed him by an information . <end>
<start> eius operae memor Tiberius sed alia praetendens exilium de precatus est quo minus senatu pelleretur non obstitit . <end>$$<start> Tiberius remembering this service , while he alleged other reasons , deprecated a sentence of exile , but did not oppose his expulsion from the Senate . <end>
<start> Pleraque eorum quae rettuli quaeque referam parva forsitan et levia memoratu videri non nescius sum sed nemo annalis nostros cum scriptura eorum contenderit qui veteres populi Romani res composuere . <end>$$<start> Much what I have related and shall have to relate , may perhaps , I am aware , seem petty trifles to record . <end>
<start> ingentia illi bella , expugnationes urbium , fusos captosque reges , aut si quando ad interna praeverterent , discordias consulum adversum tribunos , agrarias frumentariasque leges , plebis et optimatium certamina libero egressu memorabant nobis in arto et inglorius labor . <end>$$<start> But no one must compare my annals with the writings of those who have described Rome in old days They told of great wars , of the storming of cities , of the defeat and capture of kings , or whenever they turned by preference to home affairs , they related , with a free scope for digression , the strifes of consuls with tribunes , land and corn-laws , and the struggles between the commons and the aristocracy . <end>
<start> immota quippe aut modice lacessita pax , maestae urbis res et princeps proferendi imperi incuriosus erat . <end>$$<start> My labours are circumscribed and inglorious peace wholly unbroken or but slightly disturbed , dismal misery in the capital , an emperor careless about the enlargement of the empire , such is my theme . <end>
<start> non tamen sine usu fuerit introspicere illa primo aspectu levia ex quis magnarum saepe rerum motus oriuntur . <end>$$<start> Still it will not be useless to study those at first sight trifling events out of which the movements of vast changes often take their rise . <end>
<start> Nam cunctas nationes et urbes populus aut primores aut singuli regunt delecta ex iis et consociata rei publicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire , vel si evenit , haud diuturna esse potest . <end>$$<start> All nations and cities are ruled by the people , the nobility , or by one man A constitution , formed by selection out of these elements , it is easy to commend but not to produce . <end>
<start> igitur ut olim plebe valida , vel cum patres pollerent , noscenda vulgi natura et quibus modis temperanter haberetur , senatusque et optimatium ingenia qui maxime perdidicerant , callidi temporum et sapientes credebantur , sic converso statu neque alia re Romana quam si unus imperitet , haec conquiri tradique in rem fuerit , quia pauci prudentia honesta ab deterioribus , utilia ab noxiis discernunt , plures aliorum eventis docentur . <end>$$<start> or , if it is produced , it cannot be lasting Formerly , when the people had power or when the patricians were in the ascendant , the popular temper and the methods of controlling it , had to be studied , and those who knew most accurately the spirit of the Senate and aristocracy , had the credit of understanding the age and of being wise men . <end>
<start> nam situs gentium , varietates proeliorum , clari ducum exitus retinent ac redintegrant legentium animum nos saeva iussa , continuas accusationes , fallaces amicitias , perniciem innocentium et easdem exitii causas coniungimus , obvia rerum similitudine et satietate . <end>$$<start> Then , again , an ancient historian has but few disparagers , and no one cares whether you praise more heartily the armies of Carthage or Rome . <end>
<start> utque familiae ipsae iam extinctae sint , reperies qui ob similitudinem morum aliena malefacta sibi obiectari putent . <end>$$<start> or even though the families themselves may be now extinct , you will find those who , from a resemblance of character , imagine that the evil deeds of others are a reproach to themselves . <end>
<start> etiam gloria ac virtus infensos habet , ut nimis ex propinquo diversa arguens . <end>$$<start> Again , even honour and virtue make enemies , condemning , as they do , their opposites by too close a contrast . <end>
<start> sed ad inceptum redeo . <end>$$<start> But I return to my work . <end>
<start> Cornelio Cosso Asinio Agrippa consulibus Cremutius Cordus postulatur novo ac tunc primum audito crimine , quod editis annalibus laudatoque Marcus Bruto Gaius Cassium Romanorum ultimum dixisset . <end>$$<start> In the year of the consulship of Cornelius Cossus and Asinius Agrippa , Cremutius Cordus was arraigned on a new charge , now for the first time heard . <end>
<start> accusabant Satrius Secundus et Pinarius Natta , Seiani clientes . <end>$$<start> He had published a history in which he had praised Marcus Brutus and called Caius Cassius the last of the Romans . <end>
<start> id perniciabile reo et Caesar truci vultu defensionem accipiens , quam Cremutius relinquendae vitae certus in hunc modum exorsus est verba mea , patres conscripti , arguuntur adeo factorum innocens sum . <end>$$<start> His accusers were Satrius Secundus and Pinarius Natta , creatures of Sejanus This was enough to ruin the accused . <end>
<start> sed neque haec in principem aut principis parentem , quos lex maiestatis amplectitur Brutum et Cassium laudavisse dicor , quorum res gestas cum plurimi composuerint , nemo sine honore memoravit . <end>$$<start> and then too the emperor listened with an angry frown to his defence , which Cremutius , resolved to give up his life , began thus : - It is my words , Senators , which are condemned , so innocent am I of any guilty act . <end>
<start> Titus Livius , eloquentiae ac fidei praeclarus in primis , Gnaeus Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret . <end>$$<start> yet these do not touch the emperor or the emperor's mother , who are alone comprehended under the law of treason . <end>
<start> Messala Corvinus imperatorem suum Cassium praedicabat et uterque opibusque atque honoribus perviguere . <end>$$<start> The letters Antonius , the harangues of Brutus contain reproaches against Augustus , false indeed , but urged with powerful sarcasm . <end>
<start> Marci Ciceronis libro quo Catonem caelo aequavit , quid aliud dictator Caesar quam rescripta oratione velut apud iudices respondit . <end>$$<start> the poems which we read of Bibaculus and Catullus are crammed with invectives on the Caesars . <end>
<start> Antonii epistulae Bruti contiones falsa quidem in Augustum probra set multa cum acerbitate habent . <end>$$<start> Yet the Divine Julius , the Divine Augustus themselves bore all this and let it pass , whether in forbearance or in wisdom I cannot easily say . <end>
<start> namque spreta exolescunt si irascare , adgnita videntur . <end>$$<start> when you resent a thing , you seem to recognise it . <end>
<start> sed maxime solutum et sine obtrectatore fuit prodere de iis quos mors odio aut gratiae exemisset . <end>$$<start> Are Cassius and Brutus now in arms on the fields of Philippi , and am I with them rousing the people by harangues to stir up civil war . <end>
<start> num enim armatis Cassio et Bruto ac Philippensis campos optinentibus belli civilis causa populum per contiones incendo . <end>$$<start> Did they not fall more than seventy years ago , and as they are known to us by statues which even the conqueror did not destroy , so too is not some portion of their memory preserved for us by historians . <end>
<start> an illi quidem septuagesimum ante annum perempti , quo modo imaginibus suis noscuntur , quas ne victor quidem abolevit , sic partem memoriae apud scriptores retinent . <end>$$<start> To every man posterity gives his due honour , and , if a fatal sentence hangs over me , there will be those who will remember me as well as Cassius and Brutus . <end>
<start> suum cuique decus posteritas rependit . <end>$$<start> He then left the Senate and ended his life by starvation . <end>
<start> nec deerunt , si damnatio ingruit , qui non modo Cassii et Bruti set etiam mei meminerint . <end>$$<start> His books , so the Senators decreed , were to be burnt by the aediles . <end>
<start> egressus dein senatu vitam abstinentia finivit . <end>$$<start> but some copies were left which were concealed and afterwards published . <end>
<start> quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet qui praesenti potentia credunt extingui posse etiam sequentis aevi memoriam . <end>$$<start> On the contrary , the persecution of genius fosters its influence . <end>
<start> nam contra punitis ingeniis gliscit auctoritas , neque aliud externi reges aut qui eadem saevitia usi sunt nisi dedecus sibi atque illis gloriam peperere . <end>$$<start> foreign tyrants , and all who have imitated their oppression , have merely procured infamy for themselves and glory for their victims . <end>
<start> Ceterum postulandis reis tam continuus annus fuit ut feriarum Latinarum diebus praefectum urbis Drusum , auspicandi gratia tribunal ingressum , adierit Calpumius Salvianus in Sextum Marium quod a Caesare palam in crepitum causa exilii Salviano fuit . <end>$$<start> That year was such a continuous succession of prosecutions that on the days of the Latin festival when Drusus , as city-prefect , had ascended his tribunal for the inauguration of his office , Calpurnius Salvianus appeared before him against Sextus Marius . <end>
<start> obiecta publice Cyzicenis incuria caerimoniarum divi Augusti , additis violentiae criminibus adversum civis Romanos . <end>$$<start> This the emperor openly censured , and it caused the banishment of Salvianus . <end>
<start> et amisere libertatem , quam bello Mithridatis meruerant , circumsessi nec minus sua constantia quam praesidio Luculli pulso rege . <end>$$<start> Next , the people of Cyzicus were accused of publicly neglecting the established worship of the Divine Augustus , and also of acts of violence to Roman citizens . <end>
<start> at Fonteius Capito , qui pro consule Asiam curaverat , absolvitur , comperto ficta in eum crimina per Vibium Serenum . <end>$$<start> They were deprived of the franchise which they had earned during the war with Mithridates , when their city was besieged , and when they repulsed the king as much by their own bravery as by the aid of Lucullus . <end>
<start> nam ut quis destrictior accusator , velut sacrosanctus erat leves ignobiles poenis adficiebantur . <end>$$<start> only the insignificant and undistinguished were punished . <end>
<start> Per idem tempus Hispania ulterior missis ad senatum legatis oravit ut exemplo Asiae delubrum Tiberio matrique eius extrueret . <end>$$<start> About the same time Further Spain sent a deputation to the Senate , with a request to be allowed , after the example of Asia , to erect a temple to Tiberius and his mother . <end>
<start> qua occasione Caesar , validus alioqui spernendis honoribus et respondendum ratus iis quorum rumore arguebatur in ambitionem flexisse , huiusce modi orationem coepit scio , patres conscripti , constantiam meam a plerisque desideratam quod Asiae civitatibus nuper idem istud petentibus non sim adversatus . <end>$$<start> On this occasion , the emperor , who had generally a strong contempt for honours , and now thought it right to reply to the rumour which reproached him with having yielded to vanity , delivered the following speech : - I am aware , Senators , that many deplore my want of firmness in not having opposed a similar recent petition from the cities of Asia . <end>
<start> ergo et prioris silentii defensionem et quid in futurum statuerim simul aperiam . <end>$$<start> I will therefore both explain the grounds of my previous silence and my intentions for the future . <end>
<start> cum divus Augustus sibi atque urbi Romae templum apud Pergamum sisti non prohibuisset , qui omnia facta dictaque eius vice legis observem , placitum iam exemplum promptius secutus sum quia cultui meo veneratio senatus adiungebatur . <end>$$<start> Inasmuch as the Divine Augustus did not forbid the founding of a temple at Pergamos to himself and to the city of Rome , I who respect as law all his actions and sayings , have the more readily followed a precedent once approved , seeing that with the worship of myself was linked an expression of reverence towards the Senate . <end>
<start> ceterum ut semel recepisse veniam habuerit , ita per omnis provincias effgie numinum sacrari ambitiosum , superbum et vanescet Augusti honor si promiscis adulationibus vulgatur . <end>$$<start> But though it may be pardonable to have allowed this once , it would be a vain and arrogant thing to receive the sacred honour of images representing the divine throughout all the provinces , and the homage paid to Augustus will disappear if it is vulgarised by indiscriminate flattery . <end>
<start> Ego me , patres conscripti , mortalem esse et hominum officia fungi satisque habere si locum principem impleam et vos testor et meminisse posteros volo . <end>$$<start> For myself , Senators , I am mortal and limited to the functions of humanity , content if I can adequately fill the highest place . <end>
<start> qui satis superque memoriae meae tribuent , ut maioribus meis dignum , rerum vestrarum providum , constantem in periculis , offensionum pro utilitate publica non pavidum credant . <end>$$<start> of this I solemnly assure you , and would have posterity remember it They will more than sufficiently honour my memory by believing me to have been worthy of my ancestry , watchful over your interests , courageous in danger , fearless of enmity , when the State required it . <end>
<start> haec mihi in animis vestris templa , hae pulcherrimae effigies et mansurae . <end>$$<start> These sentiments of your hearts are my temples , these my most glorious and abiding monuments . <end>
<start> nam quae saxo struuntur , si iudicium posterorum in odium vertit , pro sepulchris spernuntur . <end>$$<start> Those built of stone are despised as mere tombs , if the judgment of posterity passes into hatred . <end>
<start> proinde socios civis et deos ipsos precor , hos ut mihi ad finem usque vitae quietam et intellegentem humani divinique iuris mentem duint , illos ut , quandoque concessero , cum laude et bonis recordationibus facta atque famam nominis mei prosequantur . <end>$$<start> And therefore this is my prayer to our allies , our citizens , and to heaven itself to the last , that , to my life's close , it grant me a tranquil mind , which can discern alike human and divine claims . <end>
<start> perstititque posthac secretis etiam sermonibus aspernari talem sui cultum . <end>$$<start> to the first , that , when I die , they honour my career and the reputation of my name with praise and kindly remembrance . <end>
<start> quod alii modestiam , multi , quia diffideret , quidam ut degeneris animi interpretabantur . <end>$$<start> Henceforth Tiberius even in private conversations persisted in showing contempt for such homage to himself . <end>
<start> optumos quippe mortalium altissima cupere sic Herculem et Liberum apud Graecos , Quirinum apud nos deum numero additos melius Augustum , qui speraverit . <end>$$<start> Some attributed this to modesty many to self-distrust a few to a mean spirit . <end>
<start> nam contemptu famae contemni virtutes . <end>$$<start> For to despise fame is to despise merit . <end>
<start> At Seianus nimia fortuna socors et muliebri insuper cupidine incensus , promissum matrimonium flagitante Livia , componit ad Caesarem codicillos moris quippe tum erat quamquam praesentem scripto adire . <end>$$<start> Sejanus meanwhile , dazed by his extravagant prosperity and urged on too by a woman's passion , Livia now insisting on his promise of marriage , addressed a memorial to the emperor . <end>
<start> non enim exuere imposita munia satis aestimare firmari domum adversum iniquas Agrippinae offensiones , idque liberorum causa . <end>$$<start> he thought it enough for his family to be secured against the unjust displeasure of Agrippina , and this for the sake of his children . <end>
<start> nam sibi multum superque vitae fore , quod tali cum principe explevisset . <end>$$<start> For , as for himself , enough and more than enough for him would be a life completed while such a sovereign still reigned . <end>
<start> Ad ea Tiberius laudata pietate Seiani suisque in eum beneficiis modice percursis , cum tempus tamquam ad integram consultationem petivisset , adiunxit ceteris mortalibus in eo stare consilia quid sibi conducere putent . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , in reply , after praising the loyal sentiments of Sejanus and briefly enumerating the favours he had bestowed on him , asked time for impartial consideration , adding that while other men's plans depended on their ideas of their own interest , princes , who had to regulate their chief actions by public opinion , were in a different position . <end>
<start> ideo se non illuc decurrere , quod promptum rescriptu , posse ipsam Liviam statuere , nubendum post Drusum an in penatibus isdem tolerandum haberet . <end>$$<start> Even as it is , feminine jealousies break out , and my grandsons are torn asunder by the strife . <end>
<start> esse illi matrem et aviam , propiora consilia . <end>$$<start> What will happen if the rivalry is rendered more intense by such a marriage . <end>
<start> simplicius acturum , de inimicitiis primum Agrippinae , quas longe acrius arsuras si matrimonium Liviae velut in partis domum Caesarum distraxisset . <end>$$<start> For you are mistaken , Sejanus , if you think that you will then remain in the same position , and that Livia , who has been the wife of Caius Caesar and afterwards of Drusus , will have the inclination to pass her old age with a mere Roman knight . <end>
<start> sic quoque erumpere aemulationem feminarum , eaque discordia nepotes suos convelli quid si intendatur certamen tali coniugio . <end>$$<start> Though I might allow it , do you imagine it would be tolerated by those who have seen her brother , her father , and our ancestors in the highest offices of state . <end>
<start> falleris enim , Seiane , si te mansurum in eodem ordine putas , et Liviam , quae G . <end>$$<start> You indeed desire to keep within your station . <end>
<start> ego ut sinam , credisne passuros qui fratrem eius , qui patrem maioresque nostros in summis imperiis videre . <end>$$<start> But , you say , Augustus had thoughts of giving his daughter to a Roman knight . <end>
<start> vis tu quidem istum intra locum sistere sed illi magistratus et primores , qui te invitum perrumpunt omnibusque de rebus consulunt , excessisse iam pridem equestre fastigium longeque antisse patris mei amicitias non occulti ferunt perque invidiam tui me quoque incusant . <end>$$<start> Is it surprising that , with so many distracting cares , foreseeing too the immense elevation to which a man would be raised above others by such an alliance , he talked of Caius Proculeius and certain persons of singularly quiet life , wholly free from political entanglements . <end>
<start> sed si dubitatione Augusti movemur , quanto validius est quod Marco Agrippae , mox mihi conlocavit . <end>$$<start> My own earnest thoughts and the ties with which I am still purposing to unite you to myself , I shall for the present forbear to explain . <end>
<start> atque ego haec pro amicitia non occultavi ceterum neque tuis neque Liviae destinatis adversabor . <end>$$<start> This only I will declare , that nothing is too grand to be deserved by your merits and your goodwill towards me . <end>
<start> Rursum Seianus non iam de matrimonio sed altius metuens tacita suspicionum , vulgi rumorem , ingruentem invidiam deprecatur . <end>$$<start> Sejanus , no longer thinking of his marriage but filled with a deeper alarm , rejoined by deprecating the whispers of suspicion , popular rumour and the gathering storm of odium . <end>
<start> ac ne adsiduos in domum coetus arcendo infringeret potentiam aut receptando facultatem criminantibus praeberet , huc flexit ut Tiberium ad vitam procul Roma amoenis locis degendam impelleret . <end>$$<start> In this he foresaw several advantages Access to the emperor would be under his own control , and letters , for the most part being conveyed by soldiers , would pass through his hands . <end>
<start> multa quippe providebat sua in manu aditus litterarumque magna ex parte se arbitrum fore , cum per milites commearent . <end>$$<start> Caesar too , who was already in the decline of life , would soon , when enervated by retirement , more readily transfer to him the functions of empire . <end>
<start> mox Caesarem vergente iam senecta secretoque loci mollitum munia imperii facilius tramissurum et minui sibi invidiam adempta salutantum turba sublatisque inanibus veram potentiam augeri . <end>$$<start> envy towards himself would be lessened when there was an end to his crowded levies and the reality of power would be increased by the removal of its empty show . <end>
<start> Ac forte habita per illos dies de Votieno Montano , celebris ingenii viro , cognitio cunctantem iam Tiberium perpulit ut vitandos crederet patrum coetus vocesque quae plerumque verae et graves coram ingerebantur . <end>$$<start> It happened that the trial at this time of Votienus Montanus , a popular wit , convinced the hesitating Tiberius that he ought to shun all assemblies of the Senate , where speeches , often true and offensive , were flung in his very face . <end>
<start> nam postulato Votieno ob contumelias in Caesarem dictas , testis Aemilius e militaribus viris , dum studio probandi cuncta refert et quamquam inter obstrepentis magna adseveratione nititur , audivit Tiberius probra quis per occuitum lacerabatur , adeoque perculsus est ut se vel statim vel in cognitione purgaturum clamitaret precibusque proximorum , adulatione omnium aegre componeret animum . <end>$$<start> As for Votienus , he suffered the penalty of treason but the emperor , clinging all the more obstinately to the harshness with which he had been reproached in regard to accused persons , punished Aquilia with exile for the crime of adultery with Varius Ligur , although Lentulus Gaetulicus , the consul-elect , had proposed that she should be sentenced under the Julian law . <end>
<start> Auditae dehinc Lacedaemoniorum et Messeniorum legationes de iure templi Dianae Limnatidis , quod suis a maioribus suaque in terra dicatum Lacedaemonii firmabant annalium memoria vatumque carminibus , sed Macedonis Philippi cum quo bellassent armis ademptum ac post Gaius Caesaris et Marcus Antonii sententia redditum . <end>$$<start> Then a hearing was given to embassies from the Lacedaemonians and Messenians on the question of the temple of Diana in the Marshes The Lacedaemonians asserted that it had been dedicated by their ancestors and in their territory , and appealed to the records of their history and the hymns of poets , but it had been wrested from , they said , by the arms of the Macedonian Philip , with whom they had fought , and subsequently restored by the decision of Caius Caesar and Marcus Antonius . <end>
<start> contra Messenii veterem inter Herculis posteros divisionem Peloponnesi protulere , suoque regi Denthaliatem agrum in quo id delubrum cessisse . <end>$$<start> The Messenians , on the contrary , alleged the ancient division of the Peloponnesus among the descendants of Hercules , in which the territory of Denthelia (where the temple stood) had fallen to their king . <end>
<start> monimentaque eius rei sculpta saxis et aere prisco manere . <end>$$<start> Records of this event still existed , engraven on stone and ancient bronze . <end>
<start> quod si vatum , annalium ad testimonia vocentur , pluris sibi ac locupletiores esse . <end>$$<start> But if they were asked for the testimony of poetry and of history , they had it , they said , in greater abundance and authenticity . <end>
<start> neque Philippum potentia sed ex vero statuisse idem regis Antigoni , idem imperatoris Mummii iudicium . <end>$$<start> Philip had not decided arbitrarily , but according to fact , and king Antigonus , as also the general Mummius , had pronounced the same judgment . <end>
<start> sic Milesios permisso publice arbitrio , postremo Atidium Geminum praetorem Achaiae decrevisse . <end>$$<start> Such too had been the award of the Milesians to whom the arbitration had been publicly entrusted , and , finally , of Atidius Geminus , the praetor of Achaia . <end>
<start> et Segestani aedem Veneris montem apud Erycum , vetustate dilapsam , restaurari postulavere , nota memorantes de origine eius et laeta Tiberio . <end>$$<start> Next the people of Segesta petitioned for the restoration of the temple of Venus at Mount Eryx , which had fallen to ruin from its antiquity . <end>
<start> suscepit curam libens ut consanguineus . <end>$$<start> They repeated the well-known story of its origin , which delighted Tiberius . <end>
<start> tunc tractatae Massiliensium preces probatumque Publius Rutilii exemplum . <end>$$<start> He undertook the work willingly , as being a kinsman of the goddess . <end>
<start> quo iure Vulcacius Moschus exul in Massiliensis receptus bona sua rei publicae eorum et patriae reliquerat . <end>$$<start> Volcatius Moschus , also an exile , had been received with a similar privilege by the inhabitants of Massilia , and had left his property to their community , as being now his own country . <end>
<start> Obiere eo anno viri nobiles Gnaeus Lentulus et Lucius Domitius . <end>$$<start> Two men of noble rank died in that year , Cneius Lentulus and Lucius Domitius . <end>
<start> Lentulo super consulatum et triumphalia de Getis gloriae fuerat bene tolerata paupertas , dein magnae opes innocenter partae et modeste habitae . <end>$$<start> It had been the glory of Lentulus , to say nothing of his consulship and his triumphal distinctions over the Gaetuli , to have borne poverty with a good grace , then to have attained great wealth , which had been blamelessly acquired and was modestly enjoyed . <end>
<start> Domitium decoravit pater civili bello maris potens , donec Antonii partibus , mox Caesaris misceretur . <end>$$<start> Domitius derived lustre from a father who during the civil war had been master of the sea , till he united himself to the party of Antonius and afterwards to that of Caesar . <end>
<start> avus Pharsalica acie pro optumatibus ceciderat . <end>$$<start> His grandfather had fallen in the battle of Pharsalia , fighting for the aristocracy . <end>
<start> ipse delectus cui minor Antonia , Octavia genita , in matrimonium daretur , post exercitu flumen Albim transcendit , longius penetrata Germania quam quisquam priorum , easque ob res insignia triumphi adeptus est . <end>$$<start> He had himself been chosen to be the husband of the younger Antonia , daughter of Octavia , and subsequently led an army across the Elbe , penetrating further into Germany than any Roman before him . <end>
<start> obiit et Lucius Antonius , multa claritudine generis sed improspera . <end>$$<start> For this achievement he gained triumphal honours . <end>
<start> nam patre eius Iullo Antonio ob adulterium Iuliae morte punito hunc admodum adulescentulum , sororis nepotem , seposuit Augustus in civitatem Massiliensem ubi specie studiorum nomen exilii tegeretur . <end>$$<start> Lucius Antonius too then died , of a most illustrious but unfortunate family His father , Julius Antonius , was capitally punished for adultery with Julia , and the son , when a mere youth , was banished by Augustus , whose sister's grandson he was , to the city of Massilia , where the name of exile might be masked under that of student . <end>
<start> habitus tamen supremis honor ossaque tumulo Octaviorum inlata per decretum senatus . <end>$$<start> Yet honour was paid him in death , and his bones , by the Senate's decree , were consigned to the sepulchre of the Octavii . <end>
<start> Isdem consulibus facinus atrox in citeriore Hispania admissum a quodam agresti nationis Termestinae . <end>$$<start> While the same consuls were in office , an atrocious crime was committed in Nearer Spain by a peasant of the Termestine tribe . <end>
<start> is praetorem provinciae Lucius Pisonem , pace incuriosum , ex improviso in itinere adortus uno vulnere in mortem adfecit . <end>$$<start> Suddenly attacking the praetor of the province , Lucius Piso , as he was travelling in all the carelessness of peace , he killed him with a single wound . <end>
<start> ac pernicitate equi profugus , postquam saltuosos locos attigerat , dimisso equo per derupta et avia sequentis frustratus est . <end>$$<start> He then fled on a swift horse , and reached a wooded country , where he parted with his steed and eluded pursuit amid rocky and pathless wilds . <end>
<start> neque diu fefellit nam prenso ductoque per proximos pagos equo cuius foret cognitum . <end>$$<start> But he was soon discovered The horse was caught and led through the neighbouring villages , and its owner ascertained . <end>
<start> et repertus cum tormentis edere conscios adigeretur , voce magna sermones patrio frustra se interrogari clamitavit adsisterent socii ac spectarent . <end>$$<start> Being found and put to the torture that he might be forced to reveal his accomplices , he exclaimed in a loud voice , in the language of his country , that it was in vain to question him . <end>
<start> idemque cum postero ad quaestionem retraheretur , eo nisu proripuit se custodibus saxoque caput adflixit ut statim exanimaretur . <end>$$<start> Next day , when he was dragged back to torture , he broke loose from his guards and dashed his head against a stone with such violence that he instantly fell dead . <end>
<start> sed Piso Termestinorum dolo caesus habetur . <end>$$<start> It was however believed that Piso was treacherously murdered by the Termestini . <end>
<start> quippe pecunias e publico interceptas acrius quam ut tolerarent barbari cogebat . <end>$$<start> Some public money had been embezzled , and he was pressing for its payment too rigorously for the patience of barbarians . <end>
<start> Lentulo Gaetulico Gaius Calvisio consulibus decreta triumphi insignia Poppaeo Sabino contusis Thraecum gentibus , qui montium editis incultu atque eo ferocius agitabant . <end>$$<start> In the consulship of Lentulus Gaetulicus and Caius Calvisius , triumphal distinctions were decreed to Poppaeus Sabinus , for a crushing defeat of some Thracian tribes , whose wild life in the highlands of a mountainous country made them unusually fierce . <end>
<start> causa motus super hominum ingenium , quod pati dilectus et validissimum quemque militiae nostrae dare aspernabantor , ne regibus quidem parere nisi ex libidine soliti , aut si mitterent auxilia , suos ductores praeficere nec nisi adversum accolas belligerare . <end>$$<start> Even native princes they would obey only according to their caprice , and if they sent aid , they used to appoint their own leaders and fight only against their neighbours . <end>
<start> ac tum rumor incesserat fore ut disiecti aliisque nationibus permixti diversas in terras traherentur . <end>$$<start> A rumour had then spread itself among them that , dispersed and mingled with other tribes , they were to be dragged away to distant countries . <end>
<start> sed antequam arma inciperent , misere legatos amicitiam obsequiumque memoraturos , et mansura haec si nullo novo onere temptarentur sin ut victis servitium indiceretur , esse sibi ferrum et iuventutem et promptum libertati aut ad mortem animum . <end>$$<start> Before however they took up arms , they sent envoys with assurances of their friendship and loyalty , which , they said , would continue , if they were not tried by any fresh burden . <end>
<start> simul castella rupibus indita conlatosque illuc parentes et coniuges ostentabant bellumque impeditum arduum cruentum minitabantur . <end>$$<start> As they spoke , they pointed to fortresses amid rocks whither they had conveyed their parents and their wives , and threatened us with a difficult , dangerous and sanguinary war . <end>
<start> At Sabinus , donec exercitus in unum conduceret , datis mitibus responsis , postquam Pomponius Labeo e Moesia cum legione , rex Rhoemetalces cum auxiliis popularium qui fidem non mutaverant , venere , addita praesenti copia ad hostem pergit , compositum iam per angustias saltuum . <end>$$<start> Sabinus meantime , while he was concentrating his troops , returned gentle answers but on the arrival of Pomponius Labeo with a legion from Moesia and of king Rhoemetalces with some reinforcements from his subjects , who had not thrown off their allegiance , with these and the force he had on the spot , he advanced on the enemy , who were drawn up in some wooded defiles . <end>
<start> quidam audentius apertis in collibus visebantur , quos dux Romanus acie suggressus haud aegre pepulit sanguine barbarorum modico ob propinqua suffugia . <end>$$<start> Some ventured to show themselves on the open hills these the Roman general approached in fighting order and easily dislodged them , with only a small slaughter of the barbarians , who had not far to flee . <end>
<start> mox castris in loco communitis valida manu montem occupat angustum et aequali dorso continuum usque ad proximum castellum quod magna vis armata aut incondita tuebatur . <end>$$<start> In this position he soon established a camp , and held with a strong detachment a narrow and unbroken mountain ridge , stretching as far as the next fortress , which was garrisoned by a large force of armed soldiers along with some irregulars . <end>
<start> ii dum eminus grassabantur crebra et inulta vulnera fecere propius incedentes eruptione subita turbati sunt receptique subsidio Sugambrae cohortis , quam Romanus promptam ad pericula nec minus cantuum et armorum tumultu trucem haud procul instruxerat . <end>$$<start> As they advanced , a sudden sortie put them to the rout , and they fell back on the support of a Sugambrian cohort , drawn up at no great distance by the Roman general , ready for any emergency and as terrible as the foe , with the noise of their war songs and the clashing of their arms . <end>
<start> Translata dehinc castra hostem propter , relictis apud priora munimenta Thraecibus , quos nobis adfuisse memoravi . <end>$$<start> He then moved his camp near to the enemy , leaving in his former entrenchments the Thracians who , as I have mentioned , were with us . <end>
<start> iisque permissum vastare , urere , trahere praedas , dum populatio lucem intra sisteretur noctemque in castris tutam et vigilem capesserent . <end>$$<start> These had permission to ravage , burn , and plunder , provided they confined their forays to daylight , and passed the night securely and vigilantly in their camp . <end>
<start> id primo servatum mox versi in luxum et raptis opulenti omittere stationes , lascivia epularum aut somno et vino procumbere . <end>$$<start> This at first they strictly observed Soon they resigned themselves to enjoyment , and , enriched by plunder , they neglected their guards , and amid feasts and mirth sank down in the carelessness of the banquet , of sleep and of wine . <end>
<start> igitur hostes incuria eorum comperta duo agmina parant quorum altero populatores invaderentur , alii castra Romana adpugnarent , non spe capiendi sed ut clamore , telis suo quisque periculo intentus sonorem alterius proelii non acciperet . <end>$$<start> So the enemy , apprised of their heedlessness , prepared two detachments , one of which was to attack the plunderers , the other , to fall on the Roman camp , not with the hope of taking it , but to hinder the din of the other battle from being heard by our soldiers , who , with shouts and missiles around them , would be all intent on their own peril . <end>
<start> tenebrae insuper delectae augendam ad formidinem . <end>$$<start> Night too was chosen for the movement to increase the panic . <end>
<start> sed qui vallum legionum temptabant facile pelluntur . <end>$$<start> Those however who tried to storm the entrenchment of the legions were easily repulsed . <end>
<start> Thraecum auxilia repentino incursu territa , cum pars munitionibus adiacerent , plures extra palarentur , tanto infensius caesi quanto perfugae et proditores ferre arma ad suum patriaeque servitium incusabantur . <end>$$<start> the Thracian auxiliaries were dismayed by the suddenness of the onset , for though some were lying close to their lines , far more were straggling beyond them , and the massacre was all the more savage , inasmuch as they were taunted with being fugitives and traitors and bearing arms for their own and their country's enslavement . <end>
<start> Postera die Sabinus exercitum aequo loco ostendit , si barbari successu noctis alacres proelium auderent . <end>$$<start> Next day Sabinus displayed his forces in the plain , on the chance of the barbarians being encouraged by the night's success to risk an engagement . <end>
<start> et postquam castello aut coniunctis tumulis non degrediebantur , obsidium coepit per praesidia quae opportune iam muniebat . <end>$$<start> Finding that they did not quit the fortress and the adjoining hills , he began a siege by means of the works which he had opportunely began to construct . <end>
<start> tum paulatim ut aquam pabulumque eriperet contrahere claustra artaque circumdare . <end>$$<start> He also threw up a rampart , from which to discharge stones , darts , and brands on the enemy , who was now within range . <end>
<start> et struebatur agger unde saxa hastae ignes propinquum iam in hostem iacerentur . <end>$$<start> It was thirst however which chiefly distressed them , for there was only one spring for the use of a vast multitude of soldiers and non-combatants . <end>
<start> sed nihil aeque quam sitis fatigabat , cum ingens multitudo bellatorum imbellium uno reliquo fonte uterentur . <end>$$<start> Their cattle too , penned up close to them , after the fashion of barbarians , were dying of want of fodder . <end>
<start> simulque armenta , ut mos barbaris , iuxta clausa egestate pabuli exanimari . <end>$$<start> near them lay human bodies which had perished from wounds or thirst , and the whole place was befouled with rotting carcases and stench and infection . <end>
<start> Rebusque turbatis malum extremum discordia accessit , his deditionem aliis mortem et mutuos inter se ictus parantibus et erant qui non inultum exitium sed eruptionem suaderent . <end>$$<start> One of their chiefs , Dinis , an old man who well knew by long experience both the strength and clemency of Rome , maintained that they must lay down their arms , this being the only remedy for their wretched plight , and he was the first to give himself up with his wife and children to the conqueror . <end>
<start> utrique destinatum cum libertate occidere , sed Tarsa properum finem , abrumpendas pariter spes ac metus clamitans , dedit exemplum demisso in pectus ferro . <end>$$<start> Tarsa however kept urging them to speedy death and to the instant breaking off of all hope and fear , and , by way of example , plunged his sword into his heart . <end>
<start> nec defuere qui eodem modo oppeterent . <end>$$<start> And there were some who chose the same death . <end>
<start> Turesis sua cum manu noctem opperitur haud nescio duce nostro . <end>$$<start> Turesis and his band waited for night , not without the knowledge of our general . <end>
<start> igitur firmatae stationes densioribus globis . <end>$$<start> Consequently , the sentries were strengthened with denser masses of troops . <end>
<start> et ingruebat nox nimbo atrox , hostisque clamore turbido , modo per vastum silentium , incertos obsessores effecerat , cum Sabinus circumire , hortari , ne ad ambigua sonitus aut simulationem quietis casum insidiantibus aperirent , sed sua quisque munia servarent immoti telisque non in falsum iactis . <end>$$<start> Night was coming on with a fierce storm , and the foe , one moment with a tumultuous uproar , another in awful silence , had perplexed the besiegers , when Sabinus went round the camp , entreating the men not to give a chance to their stealthy assailants by heeding embarrassing noises or being deceived by quiet , but to keep , every one , to his post without moving or discharging their darts on false alarms . <end>
<start> Interea barbari catervis decurrentes nunc in vallum manualia saxa , praeustas sudes , decisa robora iacere , nunc virgultis et cratibus et corporibus exanimis complere fossas , quidam pontis et scalas ante fabricati inferre propugnaculis eaque prensare , detrahere et adversum resistentis comminus niti . <end>$$<start> The barbarians meanwhile rushed down with their bands , now hurling at the entrenchments stones such as the hand could grasp , stakes with points hardened by fire , and boughs lopped from oaks . <end>
<start> his partae victoriae spes et si cedant insignitius flagitium , illis extrema iam salus et adsistentes plerisque matres et coniuges earumque lamenta addunt animos . <end>$$<start> Success already gained and the more marked disgrace which would follow repulse , were a stimulus to the Romans , while the courage of the foe was heightened by this last chance of deliverance and the presence of many mothers and wives with mournful cries . <end>
<start> incerti ictus , vulnera improvisa . <end>$$<start> Only however a very few of the enemy had broken through them . <end>
<start> suorum atque hostium ignoratio et montis anfractu repercussae velut a tergo voces adeo cuncta miscuerant ut quaedam munimenta Romani quasi perrupta omiserint . <end>$$<start> the rest , after their bravest men had been beaten back or wounded , were towards daybreak pushed back to the upper part of the fortress and there at last compelled to surrender . <end>
<start> neque tamen pervasere hostes nisi admodum pauci ceteros , deiecto promptissimo quoque aut saucio , adpetente iam luce trusere in summa castelli ubi tandem coacta deditio . <end>$$<start> Then the immediate neighbourhood , by the voluntary action of the inhabitants , submitted . <end>
<start> et proxima sponte incolarum recepta reliquis quo minus vi aut obsidio subigerentur praematura montis Haemi et saeva hiems subvenit . <end>$$<start> The early and severe winter of Mount Haemus saved the rest of the population from being reduced by assault or blockade . <end>
<start> At Romae commota principis domo , ut series futuri in Agrippinam exitii inciperet Claudia Pulchra sobrina eius postulatur accusante Domitio Afro . <end>$$<start> At Rome meanwhile , besides the shocks already sustained by the imperial house , came the first step towards the destruction of Agrippina , Claudia Pulchra , her cousin , being prosecuted by Domitius Afer . <end>
<start> is recens praetura , modicus dignationis et quoquo facinore properus clarescere , crimen impudicitiae , adulterum Furnium , veneficia in principem et devotiones obiectabat . <end>$$<start> Lately a praetor , a man of but moderate position and eager to become notorious by any sort of deed , Afer charged her with unchastity , with having Furnius for her paramour , and with attempts on the emperor by poison and sorcery . <end>
<start> Agrippina semper atrox , tum et periculo propinquae accensa , pergit ad Tiberium ac forte sacrificantem patri repperit . <end>$$<start> Agrippina , always impetuous , and now kindled into fury by the peril of her kinswoman , went straight to Tiberius and found him , as it happened , offering a sacrifice to his father . <end>
<start> quo initio invidiae non eiusdem ait mactare divo Augusto victimas et posteros eius insectari . <end>$$<start> This provoked an indignant outburst It is not , she exclaimed , for the same man to slay victims to the Divine Augustus and to persecute his posterity . <end>
<start> non in effigies mutas divinum spiritum transfusum se imaginem veram , caelesti sanguine ortam , intellegere discrimen , suscipere sordis . <end>$$<start> The celestial spirit has not transferred itself to the mute statue here is the true image , sprung of heavenly blood , and she perceives her danger , and assumes its mournful emblems . <end>
<start> frustra Pulchram praescribi cui sola exitii causa sit quod Agrippinam stulte prorsus ad cultum delegerit oblita Sosiae ob eadem adflictae . <end>$$<start> Pulchra's name is a mere blind the only reason for her destruction is that she has , in utter folly , selected Agrippina for her admiration , forgetting that Sosia was thereby ruined . <end>
<start> audita haec raram occulti pectoris vocem elicuere , correptamque Graeco versu admonuit non ideo laedi quia non regnaret . <end>$$<start> These words wrung from the emperor one of the rare utterances of that inscrutable breast . <end>
<start> Afer primoribus oratorum additus , divulgato ingenio et secuta adseveratione Caesaris qua suo iure disertum eum appellavit . <end>$$<start> Afer was ranked with the foremost orators , for the ability which he displayed , and which won strong praise from Tiberius , who pronounced him a speaker of natural genius . <end>
<start> mox capessendis accusationibus aut reos tutando prosperiore eloquentiae quam morum fama fuit , nisi quod aetas extrema multum etiam eloquentiae dempsit , dum fessa mente retinet silentii impatientiam . <end>$$<start> Henceforward as a counsel for the defence or the prosecution he enjoyed the fame of eloquence rather than of virtue , but old age robbed him of much of his speaking power , while , with a failing intellect , he was still impatient of silence . <end>
<start> At Agrippina pervicax irae et morbo corporis implicata , cum viseret eam Caesar , profusis diu ac per silentium lacrimis , mox invidiam et preces orditur subveniret solitudini , daret maritum . <end>$$<start> Agrippina in stubborn rage , with the grasp of disease yet on her , when the emperor came to see her , wept long and silently , and then began to mingle reproach and supplication . <end>
<start> habilem adhuc inventam sibi neque aliud probis quam ex matrimonio solacium . <end>$$<start> She begged him to relieve her loneliness and provide her with a husband . <end>
<start> sed Caesar non ignarus quantum ex re publica peteretur , ne tamen offensionis aut metus manifestus foret sine responso quamquam instantem reliquit . <end>$$<start> But the emperor , who perceived the political aims of her request , but did not wish to show displeasure or apprehension , left her , notwithstanding her urgency , without an answer . <end>
<start> id ego , a scriptoribus annalium non traditum , repperi in commentariis Agrippinae filiae quae Neronis principis mater vitam suam et casus suorum posteris memoravit . <end>$$<start> This incident , not mentioned by any historian , I have found in the memoirs of the younger Agrippina , the mother of the emperor Nero , who handed down to posterity the story of her life and of the misfortunes of her family . <end>
<start> Ceterum Seianus maerentem et improvidam altius perculit , immissis qui per speciem amicitiae monerent paratum ei venenum , vitandas soceri epulas . <end>$$<start> Sejanus meanwhile yet more deeply alarmed the sorrowing and unsuspecting woman by sending his agents , under the guise of friendship , with warnings that poison was prepared for her , and that she ought to avoid her father-in-law's table . <end>
<start> atque illa simulationum nescia , cum propter discumberet , non vultu aut sermone flecti , nullos attingere cibos , donec advertit Tiberius , forte an quia audiverat . <end>$$<start> Knowing not how to dissemble , she relaxed neither her features nor tone of voice as she sat by him at dinner , nor did she touch a single dish , till at last Tiberius noticed her conduct , either casually or because he was told of it . <end>
<start> idque quo acrius experiretur , poma , ut erant adposita , laudans nurui sua manu tradidit . <end>$$<start> To test her more closely , he praised some fruit as it was set on the table and passed it with his own hand to his daughter-in-law . <end>
<start> aucta ex eo suspicio Agrippinae et intacta ore servis tramisit . <end>$$<start> This increased the suspicions of Agrippina , and without putting the fruit to her lips she gave it to the slaves . <end>
<start> nec tamen Tiberii vox coram secuta , sed obversus ad matrem non mirum ait si quid severius in eam statuisset a qua veneficii insimularetur . <end>$$<start> Still no remark fell from Tiberius before the company , but he turned to his mother and whispered that it was not surprising if he had decided on harsh treatment against one who implied that he was a poisoner . <end>
<start> inde rumor parari exitium neque id imperatorem palam audere , secretum ad perpetrandum quaeri . <end>$$<start> Then there was a rumour that a plan was laid for her destruction , that the emperor did not dare to attempt it openly , and was seeking to veil the deed in secrecy . <end>
<start> Sed Caesar quo famam averteret adesse frequens senatoi legatosque Asiae ambigentis quanam in civitate templum statueretur pluris per dies audivit . <end>$$<start> Tiberius , to divert people's talk , continually attended the Senate , and gave an audience of several days to embassies from Asia on a disputed question as to the city in which the temple before mentioned should be erected . <end>
<start> neque multum distantia inter se memorabant de vetustate generis , studio in populum Romanum per bella Persi et Aristonici aliorumque regum . <end>$$<start> But the people of Hypaepa , Tralles , Laodicaea , and Magnesia were passed over as too insignificant . <end>
<start> verum Hypaepeni Trallianique Laodicenis ac Magnetibus simul tramissi ut pamum validi . <end>$$<start> even Ilium , though it boasted that Troy was the cradle of Rome , was strong only in the glory of its antiquity . <end>
<start> paulum addubitatum quod Halicarnasii mille et ducentos per annos nullo motu terrae nutavisse sedes suas vivoque in saxo fundamenta templi adseveraverant . <end>$$<start> Pergamos , it was thought , had been sufficiently honoured by having a temple of Augustus in the city , on which very fact they relied . <end>
<start> Pergamenos (eo ipso nitebantur) aede Augusto ibi sita satis adeptos creditum . <end>$$<start> The Ephesians and Milesians had , it seemed , wholly devoted their respective towns to the worships of Apollo and Diana . <end>
<start> Ephesii Milesiique , hi Apollinis , illi Dianae caerimonia occupavisse civitates visi . <end>$$<start> And so the question lay between Sardis and Smyrna . <end>
<start> ita Sardianos inter Zmyrnaeosque deliberatum . <end>$$<start> The envoys from Sardis read a decree of the Etrurians , with whom they claimed kindred . <end>
<start> Sardiani decretum Etruriae recitavere ut consanguinei nam Tyrrhenum Lydumque Atye rege genitos ob multitudinem divisisse gentem . <end>$$<start> Tyrrhenus and Lydus , it was said , the sons of King Atys , divided the nation between them because of its multitude . <end>
<start> Lydum patriis in terris resedisse , Tyrrheno datum novas ut conderet sedes . <end>$$<start> Lydus remained in the country of his fathers . <end>
<start> auctamque adhuc Lydorum opulentiam missis in Graeciam populis cui mox a Pelope nomen . <end>$$<start> The resources of the Lydians were yet further augmented by the immigration of nations into that part of Greece which afterwards took its name from Pelops . <end>
<start> simul litteras imperatorum et icta nobiscum foedera bello Macedonum ubertatemque fluminum suorum , temperiem caeli ac ditis circum terras memorabant . <end>$$<start> They spoke too of letters from Roman generals , of treaties concluded with us during the Macedonian war , and of their copious rivers , of their climate , and the rich countries round them . <end>
<start> At Zmymaei repetita vetustate , seu Tantalus Iove ortus illos , sive Theseus divina et ipse stirpe , sive una Amazonum condidisset , transcendere ad ea , quis maxime fidebant , in populum Romanum officiis , missa navali copia non modo externa ad bella sed quae in Italia tolerabantur . <end>$$<start> The envoys from Smyrna , after tracing their city's antiquity back to such founders as either Tantalus , the son of Jupiter , or Theseus , also of divine origin , or one of the Amazons , passed on to that on which they chiefly relied , their services to the Roman people , whom they had helped with naval armaments , not only in wars abroad , but in those under which we struggled in Italy . <end>
<start> seque primos templum urbis Romae statuisse , Marcus Porcio consule , magnis quidem iam populi Romani rebus , nondum tamen ad summum elatis , stante adhuc Punica urbe et validis per Asiam regibus . <end>$$<start> They had also been the first , they said , to build a temple in honour of Rome , during the consulship of Marcus Porcius Cato , when Rome's power indeed was great , but not yet raised to the highest point , inasmuch as the Punic capital was still standing and there were mighty kings in Asia . <end>
<start> simul Lucius Sullam testem adferebant , gravissimo in discrimine exercitus ob asperitatem hiemis et penuriam vestis , cum id Zmyrnam in contionem nuntiatum foret , omnis qui adstabant detraxisse corpori tegmina nostrisque legionibus misisse . <end>$$<start> They appealed too to the of Lucius Sulla , whose army was once in terrible jeopardy from a severe winter and want of clothing , and this having been announced at Smyrna in a public assembly , all who were present stript their clothes off their backs and sent them to our legions . <end>
<start> ita rogati sententiam patres Zmyrnaeos praetulere . <end>$$<start> And so the Senate , when the question was put , gave the preference to Smyrna . <end>
<start> censuitque Vibius Marsus ut M Lepido , cui ea provincia obvenerat , super numerum legaretur qui templi curam susciperet . <end>$$<start> Vibius Marsus moved that Marcus Lepidus , to whom the province of Asia had been assigned , should have under him a special commissioner to undertake the charge of this temple . <end>
<start> et quia Lepidus ipse deligere per modestiam abnuebat , Valerius Naso e praetoriis sorte missus est . <end>$$<start> As Lepidus himself , out of modesty , declined to appoint , Valerius Naso , one of the ex-praetors , was chosen by lot and sent out . <end>
<start> Inter quae diu meditato prolatoque saepius consilio tandem Caesar in Campaniam , specie dedicandi templa apud Capuam Iovi , apud Nolam Augusto , sed certus procul urbe degere . <end>$$<start> Meanwhile , after long reflection on his purpose and frequent deferment of it , the emperor retired into Campania to dedicate , as he pretended , a temple to Jupiter at Capua and another to Augustus at Nola , but really resolved to live at a distance from Rome . <end>
<start> causam abscessus quamquam secutus plurimos auctorum ad Seiani artes rettuli , quia tamen caede eius patrata sex postea annos pari secreto conionxit , plerumque permoveor num ad ipsum referri verius sit , saevitiam ac libidinem cum factis promeret , locis occultantem erant qui crederent in senectute corporis quoque habitum pudori fuisse quippe illi praegracilis et incurva proceritas , nudus capillo vertex , ulcerosa facies ac plerumque medicaminibus interstincta . <end>$$<start> Some thought that in his old age he was ashamed of his personal appearance He had indeed a tall , singularly slender and stooping figure , a bald head , a face full of eruptions , and covered here and there with plasters In the seclusion of Rhodes he had habituated himself to shun society and to hide his voluptuous life . <end>
<start> et Rhodi secreto vitare coetus , recondere voluptates insuerat . <end>$$<start> According to one account his mother's domineering temper drove him away . <end>
<start> nam dubitaverat Augustus Germanicum , sororis nepotem et cunctis laudatum , rei Romanae imponere , sed precibus usoris evictus Tiberio Germanicum , sibi Tiberium adscivit . <end>$$<start> For Augustus had had thoughts of putting the Roman state under Germanicus , his sister's grandson , whom all men esteemed , but yielding to his wife's entreaties he left Germanicus to be adopted by Tiberius and adopted Tiberius himself . <end>
<start> idque Augusta exprobrabat , reposcebat . <end>$$<start> With this Augusta would taunt her son , and claim back what she had given . <end>
<start> Profectio arto comitatu fuit unus senator consulatu functus , Cocceius Nerva , cui legum peritia , eques Romanus praeter Seianum ex inlustribus Curtius Atticus , ceteri liberalibus studiis praediti , ferme Graeci , quorum sermonibus levaretur . <end>$$<start> His departure was attended by a small retinue , one senator , who was an ex-consul , Cocceius Nerva , learned in the laws , one Roman knight , besides Sejanus , of the highest order , Curtius Atticus , the rest being men of liberal culture , for the most part Greeks , in whose conversation he might find amusement . <end>
<start> ferebant periti caelestium iis motibus siderum excessisse Roma Tiberium ut reditus illi negaretur . <end>$$<start> It was said by men who knew the stars that the motions of the heavenly bodies when Tiberius left Rome were such as to forbid the possibility of his return . <end>
<start> unde exitii causa multis fuit properum finem vitae coniectantibus vulgantibusque . <end>$$<start> This caused ruin for many who conjectured that his end was near and spread the rumour . <end>
<start> neque enim tam incredibilem casum providebant ut undecim per annos libens patria careret . <end>$$<start> for they never foresaw the very improbable contingency of his voluntary exile from his home for eleven years . <end>
<start> mox patuit breve confinium artis et falsi veraque quam obscuris tegerentur . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards it was clearly seen what a narrow margin there is between such science and delusion and in what obscurity truth is veiled . <end>
<start> nam in urbem non regressurum haud forte dictum ceterorum nescii egere , cum propinquo rure aut litore et saepe moenia urbis adsidens extremam senectam compleverit . <end>$$<start> That he would not return to Rome was not a mere random assertion as to the rest , they were wholly in the dark , seeing that he lived to extreme old age in the country or on the coast near Rome and often close to the very walls of the city . <end>
<start> Ac forte illis diebus oblatum Caesari anceps periculum auxit vana rumoris praebuitque ipsi materiem cur amicitiae constantiaeque Seiani magis fideret . <end>$$<start> It happened at this time that a perilous accident which occurred to the emperor strengthened vague rumours and gave him grounds for trusting more fully in the friendship and fidelity of Sejanus . <end>
<start> vescebantur in villa cui vocabulum Speluncae mare Amunclanum inter et Fundanos montis nativo in specu . <end>$$<start> The rocks at its entrance suddenly fell in and crushed some of the attendants . <end>
<start> eius os lapsis repente saxis obruit quosdam ministros hinc metus in omnis et fuga eorum qui convivium celebrabant . <end>$$<start> there upon panic seized the whole company and there was a general flight of the guests . <end>
<start> Seianus genu voltuque et manibus super Caesarem suspensus opposuit sese incidentibus atque habitu tali repertus est a militibus qui subsidio venerant . <end>$$<start> Sejanus hung over the emperor , and with knee , face , and hand encountered the falling stones . <end>
<start> Haec atque talia audienti nihil quidempravae cogitationis , sed interdum voces procedebant contumaces et inconsultae , quas adpositi custodes exceptas auctasque cum deferrent neque Neroni defendere daretur , diversae insuper sollicitudinum formae oriebantur . <end>$$<start> Nero , while he listened to this and like talk , was not indeed inspired with any guilty ambition , but still occasionally there would break from him wilful and thoughtless expressions which spies about his person caught up and reported with exaggeration , and this he had no opportunity of rebutting . <end>
<start> nam alius occursum eius vitare , quidam salutatione reddita statim averti , plerique inceptum sermonem abrumpere , insistentibus contra inridentibusque qui Seiano fautores aderant . <end>$$<start> another after returning his salutation would instantly turn away many after beginning a conversation would instantly break it off , while Sejanus's friends would stand their ground and laugh at him . <end>
<start> enimvero Tiberius torvus aut falsum renidens vultu seu loqueretur seu taceret iuvenis , crimen ex silentio , ex voce . <end>$$<start> Tiberius indeed wore an angry frown or a treacherous smile Whether the young prince spoke or held his tongue , silence and speech were alike criminal . <end>
<start> ne nox quidem secura , cum uxor vigilias somnos suspiria matri Liviae atque illa Seiano patefaceret . <end>$$<start> Every night had its anxieties , for his sleepless hours , his dreams and sighs were all made known by his wife to her mother Livia and by Livia to Sejanus . <end>
<start> qui fratrem quoque Neronis Drusum traxit in partis , spe obiecta principis loci si priorem aetate et iam labefactum demovisset . <end>$$<start> Nero's brother Drusus Sejanus actually drew into his scheme by holding out to him the prospect of becoming emperor through the removal of an elder brother , already all but fallen . <end>
<start> neque tamen Seianus ita Drusum fovabat ut non in eum quoque semina futuri exitii meditaretur , gnarus praeferocem et insidiis magis opportunum . <end>$$<start> And yet Sejanus , while he favoured Drusus , was not without thoughts of sowing the seeds of his future ruin , well knowing how very impetuous he was and therefore the more exposed to treachery . <end>
<start> Fine anni excessere insignes viri Asinius Agrippa , claris maioribus quam vetustis vitaque non degener , et Quintus Haterius , familia senatoria , eloquentiae quoad vixit celebratae monimenta ingeni eius haud perinde retinentur . <end>$$<start> Towards the close of the year died two distinguished men , Asinius Agrippa and Quintus Haterius Agrippa was of illustrious rather than ancient ancestry , which his career did not disgrace . <end>
<start> utque aliorum meditatio et labor in posterum valescit , sic Haterii canorum illud et profluens cum ipso simul extinctum est . <end>$$<start> While the research and labours of other authors are valued by an after age , the harmonious fluency of Haterius died with him . <end>
<start> Marcus Licinio Lucius Calpurnio consulibus ingentium bellorum cladem aequavit malum improvisum eius initium simul et finis extitit . <end>$$<start> In the year of the consulship of Marcus Licinius and Lucius Calpurnius , the losses of a great war were matched by an unexpected disaster , no sooner begun than ended . <end>
<start> nam coepto apud Fidenam amphitheatro Atilius quidam libertini generis , quo spectaculum gladiatorum celebraret , neque fundamenta per solidum subdidit neque firmis nexibus ligneam compagem superstruxit , ut qui non abundantia pecuniae nec municipali ambitione sed in sordidam mercedem id negotium quaesivisset . <end>$$<start> One Atilius , of the freedman class , having undertaken to build an amphitheatre at Fidena for the exhibition of a show of gladiators , failed to lay a solid foundation to frame the wooden superstructure with beams of sufficient strength . <end>
<start> adfluxere avidi talium , imperitante Tiberio procul voluptatibus habiti , virile ac muliebre secus , omnis aetas , ob propinquitatem loci effusius . <end>$$<start> for he had neither an abundance of wealth , nor zeal for public popularity , but he had simply sought the work for sordid gain . <end>
<start> unde gravior pestis fuit , conferta mole , dein convulsa , dum ruit intus aut in exteriora effunditur immensamque vim mortalium , spectaculo intentos aut qui circum adstabant , praeceps trahit atque operit . <end>$$<start> Thither flocked all who loved such sights and who during the reign of Tiberius had been wholly debarred from such amusements . <end>
<start> et illi quidem quos principium stragis in mortem adflixerat , ut tali sorte , cruciatum effugere miserandi magis quos abrupta parte corporis nondum vita deseruerat . <end>$$<start> men and women of every age crowding to the place because it was near Rome And so the calamity was all the more fatal . <end>
<start> etiam quorum diversa de causa amici aut necessarii aberant , pavere tamen . <end>$$<start> Soon all the neighbours in their excitement at the report were bewailing brothers , kinsmen or parents . <end>
<start> Vt coepere dimoveri obruta , concursus ad exanimos complectentium , osculantium . <end>$$<start> As soon as they began to remove the debris , there was a rush to see the lifeless forms and much embracing and kissing . <end>
<start> et saepe certamen si con fusior facies sed par forma aut aetas errorem adgnoscentibus fecerat . <end>$$<start> Often a dispute would arise , when some distorted face , bearing however a general resemblance of form and age , had baffled their efforts at recognition . <end>
<start> quinquaginta hominum milia eo casu debilitata vel obtrita sunt . <end>$$<start> Fifty thousand persons were maimed or destroyed in this disaster . <end>
<start> cautumque in posterum senatus consulto ne quis gladiatorium munus ederet cui minor quadringentorum milium res neve amphitheatrum imponeretur nisi solo firmitatis spectatae . <end>$$<start> For the future it was provided by a decree of the Senate that no one was to exhibit a show of gladiators , whose fortune fell short of four hundred thousand sesterces , and that no amphitheatre was to be erected except on a foundation , the solidity of which had been examined . <end>
<start> Atilius in exilium actus est . <end>$$<start> Atilius was banished . <end>
<start> Ceterum sub recentem cladem patuere procerum domus , fomenta et medici passim praebiti , fuitque urbs per illos dies quamquam maesta facie veterum institutis similis , qui magna post proelia saucios largitione et cura sustentabant . <end>$$<start> At the moment of the calamity the nobles threw open houses and supplied indiscriminately medicines and physicians , so that Rome then , notwithstanding her sorrowful aspect , wore a likeness to the manners of our forefathers who after a great battle always relieved the wounded with their bounty and attentions . <end>
<start> Nondum ea clades exoleverat cum ignis violentia urbem ultra solitum adfecit , deusto monte Caelio . <end>$$<start> This disaster was not forgotten when a furious conflagration damaged the capital to an unusual extent , reducing Mount Caelius to ashes . <end>
<start> feralemque annum ferebant et ominibus adversis susceptum principi consilium absentiae , qui mos vulgo , fortuita ad culpam trahentes , ni Caesar obviam isset tribuendo pecunias ex modo detrimenti . <end>$$<start> It was an ill-starred year , people began to say , and the emperor's purpose of leaving Rome must have been formed under evil omens . <end>
<start> actaeque ei grates apud senatum ab inlustribus famaque apud populum , quia sine ambitione aut proximorum precibus ignotos etiam et ultro accitos munificentia iuverat . <end>$$<start> They began in vulgar fashion to trace ill-luck to guilt , when Tiberius checked them by distributing money in proportion to losses sustained . <end>
<start> adduntur sententiae ut mons Caelius in posterum Augustus appellaretur , quando cunctis circum flagrantibus sola Tiberii effigies sita in domo Iunii senatoris inviolata mansisset . <end>$$<start> He received a vote of thanks in the Senate from its distinguished members , and was applauded by the populace for having assisted with his liberality , without partiality or the solicitations of friends , strangers whom he had himself sought out . <end>
<start> sanctos acceptosque numinibus Claudios et augendam caerimoniam loco in quo tantum in principem honorem di ostenderint . <end>$$<start> hence the Claudii had been accounted sacred and numbered among deities , and so additional sanctity ought to be given to a spot where heaven showed such honour to the emperor . <end>
<start> Haud fuerit absurdum tradere montem eum antiquitus Querquetulanum cognomento fuisse , quod talis silvae frequens fecundusque erat , mox Caelium appellitatum a Caele Vibenna , qui dux gentis Etruscae cum auxilium tulisset sedem eam acceperat a Tarquinio Prisco , seu quis alius regum dedit nam scriptores in eo dissentiunt . <end>$$<start> It will not be uninteresting to mention that Mount Caelius was anciently known by the name of Querquetulanus , because it grew oak timber in abundance and was afterwards called Caelius by Caeles Vibenna , who led the Etruscan people to the aid of Rome and had the place given him as a possession by Tarquinius Priscus or by some other of the kings . <end>
<start> cetera non ambigua sunt , magnas eas copias per plana etiam ac foro propinqua habitavisse , unde Tuscum vicum e vocabulo advenarum dictum . <end>$$<start> As to that point historians differ as to the rest , it is beyond a question that Vibenna's numerous forces established themselves in the plain beneath and in the neighbourhood of the forum , and that the Tuscan street was named after these strangers . <end>
<start> Sed ut studia procerum et largitio principis adversum casus solacium tulerant , ita accusatorum maior in dies et infestior vis sine levamento grassabatur . <end>$$<start> But though the zeal of the nobles and the bounty of the prince brought relief to suffering , yet every day a stronger and fiercer host of informers pursued its victims , without one alleviating circumstance . <end>
<start> corripueratque Varum Quintilium , divitem et Caesari propinquum , Domitius Afer , Claudiae Pulchrae matris eius condemnator , nullo mirante quad diu egens et parto nuper praemio male usus plura ad flagitia accingeretur . <end>$$<start> Quintilius Varus , a rich man and related to the emperor , was suddenly attacked by Domitius Afer , the successful prosecutor of Claudia Pulchra , his mother , and no one wondered that the needy adventurer of many years who had squandered his lately gotten recompense was now preparing himself for fresh iniquities . <end>
<start> Publium Dolabellam socium delationis extitisse miraculo erat , quia claris maioribus et Varo conexus suam ipse nobilitatem , suum sanguinem perditum ibat . <end>$$<start> That Publius Dolabella should have associated himself in the prosecution was a marvel , for he was of illustrious ancestry , was allied to Varus , and was now himself seeking to destroy his own noble race , his own kindred . <end>
<start> restitit tamen senatus et opperiendum imperatorem censuit , quod unum urgentium malorum suffugium in tempus erat . <end>$$<start> The Senate however stopped the proceeding , and decided to wait for the emperor , this being the only means of escaping for a time impending horrors . <end>
<start> At Caesar dedicatis per Campaniam templis , quamquam edicto monuisset ne quis quietem eius inrumperet , concursusque oppidanorum disposito milite prohiberentur , perosus tamen municipia et colonias omniaque in continenti sita Capreas se in insulam abdidit trium milium freto ab extremis Surrentini promunturii diiunctam . <end>$$<start> Caesar , meanwhile , after dedicating the temples in Campania , warned the public by an edict not to disturb his retirement and posted soldiers here and there to keep off the throngs of townsfolk . <end>
<start> caeli temperies hieme mitis obiectu montis quo saeva ventorum arcentur . <end>$$<start> It commanded too a prospect of the most lovely bay , till Vesuvius , bursting into flames , changed the face of the country . <end>
<start> aestas in favonium obversa et aperto circum pelago peramoena . <end>$$<start> Greeks , so tradition says , occupied those parts and Capreae was inhabited by the Teleboi . <end>
<start> prospectabatque pulcherrimum sinum , antequam Vesuvius mons ardescens faciem loci verteret . <end>$$<start> Tiberius had by this time filled the island with twelve country houses , each with a grand name and a vast structure of its own . <end>
<start> sed tum Tiberius duodecim villarum nominibus et molibus insederat , quanto intentus olim publicas ad curas tanto occultiores in luxus et malum otium resolutus . <end>$$<start> For he still retained that rash proneness to suspect and to believe , which even at Rome Sejanus used to foster , and which he here excited more keenly , no longer concealing his machinations against Agrippina and Nero . <end>
<start> manebat quippe suspicionum et credendi temeritas quam Seianus augere etiam in urbe suetus acrius turbabat non iam occultis adversum Agrippinam et Neronem insidiis . <end>$$<start> Soldiers hung about them , and every message , every visit , their public and their private life were I may say regularly chronicled . <end>
<start> quis additus miles nuntios , introitus , aperta secreta velut in annalis referebat , ultroque struebantur qui monerent perfugere ad Germaniae exercitus vel celeberrimo fori effigiem divi Augusti amplecti populumque ac senatum auxilio vocare . <end>$$<start> And persons were actually suborned to advise them to flee to the armies of Germany , or when the Forum was most crowded , to clasp the statue of statue of the Divine Augustus and appeal to the protection of the people and Senate . <end>
<start> eaque spreta ab illis , velut pararent , obiciebantur . <end>$$<start> These counsels they disdained , but they were charged with having had thoughts of acting on them . <end>
<start> Iunio Silano et Silio Nerva consulibus foedum anni principium incessit tracto in carcerem inlustri equite Romano Titio Sabino ob amicitiam Germanici neque enim omiserat coniugem liberosque eius percolere , sectator domi , comes in publico , post tot clientes unus eoque apud bonos laudatus et gravis iniquis . <end>$$<start> The year of the consulship of Silanus and Silius Nerva opened with a foul beginning A Roman knight of the highest rank , Titius Sabinus , was dragged to prison because he had been a friend of Germanicus . <end>
<start> hunc Latinius Latiaris , Porcius Cato , Petilius Rufus , Marcus Opsius praetura functi adgrediuntur , cupidine consulatus ad quem non nisi per Seianum aditus . <end>$$<start> He had indeed persisted in showing marked respect towards his wife and children , as their visitor at home , their companion in public , the solitary survivor of so many clients , and he was consequently esteemed by the good , as he was a terror to the evil-minded . <end>
<start> compositum inter ipsos ut Latiaris , qui modico usu Sabinum contingebat , strueret dolum , ceteri testes adessent , deinde accusationem inciperent . <end>$$<start> They arranged amongst themselves that Latiaris , who had some slight acquaintance with Sabinus , should devise the plot , that the rest should be present as witnesses , and that then they should begin the prosecution . <end>
<start> igitur Latiaris iacere fortuitos primum sermones , mox laudare constantiam quod non , ut ceteri , florentis domus amicus adflictam deseruisset . <end>$$<start> Accordingly Latiaris , after first dropping some casual remarks , went on to praise the fidelity of Sabinus in not having , like others , forsaken after its fall the house of which he had been the friend in its prosperity . <end>
<start> simul honora de Germanico , Agrippinam miserans , disserebat . <end>$$<start> He also spoke highly of Germanicus and compassionately of Agrippina . <end>
<start> et postquam Sabinus , ut sunt molles in calamitate mortalium animi , effudit lacrimas , iunxit questus , audentius iam onerat Seianum , saevitiam , superbiam , spes eius . <end>$$<start> Sabinus , with the natural softness of the human heart under calamity , burst into tears , which he followed up with complaints , and soon with yet more daring invective against Sejanus , against his cruelty , pride and ambition . <end>
<start> ne in Tiberium quidem convicio abstinet . <end>$$<start> He did not spare even Tiberius in his reproaches . <end>
<start> iique sermones tamquam vetita miscuissent speciem artae amicitiae fecere . <end>$$<start> That conversation , having united them , as it were , in an unlawful secret , led to a semblance of close intimacy . <end>
<start> ac iam ultro Sabinus quaerere Latiarem , ventitare domum , dolores suos quasi ad fidissimum deferre . <end>$$<start> Henceforward Sabinus himself sought Latiaris , went continually to his house , and imparted to him his griefs , as to a most faithful friend . <end>
<start> Consultant quos memoravi quonam modo ea plurium auditu acciperentur . <end>$$<start> The men whom I have named now consulted how these conversations might fall within the hearing of more persons . <end>
<start> et si pone foris adsisterent , metus visus , sonitus aut forte ortae suspicionis erat . <end>$$<start> They applied their ears to apertures and crevices . <end>
<start> tectum inter et laquearia tres senatores haud minus turpi latebra quam detestanda fraude sese abstrudunt , foraminibus et rimis aurem admovent . <end>$$<start> Latiaris meanwhile having met Sabinus in the streets , drew him to his house and to the room , as if he was going to communicate some fresh discoveries . <end>
<start> interea Latiaris repertum in publico Sabinum , velut recens cognita narraturus , domum et in cubiculum trahit praeteritaque et instantia , quorum adfatim copia , ac novos terrores cumulat . <end>$$<start> There he talked much about past and impending troubles , a copious topic indeed , and about fresh horrors . <end>
<start> eadem ille et s diutius , quanto maesta , ubi semel prorupere , difficilius reticentur . <end>$$<start> Sabinus spoke as before and at greater length , as sorrow , when once it has broken into utterance , is the harder to restrain . <end>
<start> properata inde accusatio missisque ad Caesarem litteris ordinem fraudis suumque ipsi dedecus narravere . <end>$$<start> Instantly they hastened to accuse him , and having despatched a letter to the emperor , they informed him of the order of the plot and of their own infamy . <end>
<start> non alias magis anxia et pavens civitas , tegens adversum proximos . <end>$$<start> Never was Rome more distracted and terror-stricken . <end>
<start> congressus , conloquia , notae ignotaeque aures vitari . <end>$$<start> Meetings , conversations , the ear of friend and stranger were alike shunned . <end>
<start> etiam muta atque inanima , tectum et parietes circumspectabantur . <end>$$<start> even things mute and lifeless , the very roofs and walls , were eyed with suspicion . <end>
<start> Sed Caesar sollemnia incipientis anni kalendis Ianuariis epistula precatus vertit in Sabinum , corruptos quosdam libertorum et petitum se arguens , ultionemque haud obscure poscebat . <end>$$<start> The emperor in his letter on the first of January , after offering the usual prayers for the new year , referred to Sabinus , whom he reproached with having corrupted some of his freedmen and having attempted his life , and he claimed vengeance in no obscure language . <end>
<start> quo intendisset oculos , quo verba acciderent , fuga vastitas , deseri itinera fora . <end>$$<start> A few retraced their steps and again showed themselves , shuddering at the mere fact that they had betrayed alarm . <end>
<start> non imprudentem Tiberium tantam invidiam adisse quaesitum meditatumque , ne quid impedire credatur quo minus novi magistratus , quo modo delubra et altaria , sic carcerem recludant . <end>$$<start> this is a studied device to make us believe that there is no reason why the new magistrates should not open the dungeons as well as the temple and the altars . <end>
<start> secutae insuper litterae grates agentis quod hominem infensum rei publicae punivissent , adiecto trepidam sibi vitam , suspectas inimicorum insidias , nullo nominatim compellato . <end>$$<start> Thereupon there came a letter of thanks to them for having punished a bitter foe to the State , and the emperor further added that he had an anxious life , that he apprehended treachery from enemies , but he mentioned no one by name . <end>
<start> neque tamen dubitabatur in Neronem et Agrippinam intendi . <end>$$<start> Still there was no question that this was aimed at Nero and Agrippina . <end>
<start> Ni mihi destinatum foret suum quaeque in annum referre , avebat animus antire statimque memorare exitus quos Latinus atque Opsius ceterique flagitii eius repertores habuere , non modo postquam Gaius Caesar rerum potitus est sed incolumi Tiberio , qui scelerum ministros ut perverti ab aliis nolebat , ita plerumque satiatus et oblatis in eandem operam recentibus veteres et praegravis adflixit verum has atque alias sontium poenas in tempore trademus . <end>$$<start> But for my plan of referring each event to its own year , I should feel a strong impulse to anticipate matters and at once relate the deaths by which Latinius and Opsius and the other authors of this atrocious deed perished , some after Caius became emperor , some even while Tiberius yet ruled . <end>
<start> tum censuit Asinius Gallus , cuius liberorum Agrippina matertera erat , petendum a principe ut metus suos senatui fateretur amoverique sineret . <end>$$<start> Asinius Gallus , to whose children Agrippina was aunt , then moved that the emperor should be requested to disclose his apprehensions to the Senate and allow their removal . <end>
<start> nullam acque Tiberius , ut rebatur , ex virtutibus suis quam dissimulationem diligebat eo aegrius accepit recludi quae premeret . <end>$$<start> Of all his virtues , as he counted them , there was none on which Tiberius so prided himself as his ability to dissemble , and he was therefore the more irritated at an attempt to expose what he was hiding . <end>
<start> sed mitigavit Seianus , non Galli amore verum ut cunctationes principis opperiretur , gnarus lentum in meditando , ubi prorupisset , tristibus dictis atrocia facta coniungere . <end>$$<start> Sejanus however pacified him , not out of love for Gallus , but rather to wait the result of the emperor's wavering mood , knowing , as he did , that , though slow in forming his purpose , yet having once broken through his reserve , he would follow up harsh words with terrible deeds . <end>
<start> Per idem tempus Iulia mortem obiit , quam neptem Augustus convictam adulterii damnaverat proieceratque in insulam Trimentm , haud procul Apulis litoribus . <end>$$<start> He had condemned her on a conviction of adultery and had banished her to the island of Trimerus , not far from the shores of Apulia . <end>
<start> Eodem anno Frisii , transrhenanus popolus , pacem exuere , nostra magis avaritia quam obsequii impatientes . <end>$$<start> That same year the Frisii , a nation beyond the Rhine , cast off peace , more because of our rapacity than from their impatience of subjection . <end>
<start> tributum iis Drusus iusserat modicum pro angustia rerum , ut in usus militaris coria boum penderent , non intenta cuiusquam cura quae firmitudo , quae mensura , donec Olennius e primipilaribus regendis Frisiis impositus terga urorum delegit quorum ad formam acciperentur . <end>$$<start> No one ever severely scrutinized the size or thickness till Olennius , a first-rank centurion , appointed to govern the Frisii , selected hides of wild bulls as the standard according to which they were to be supplied . <end>
<start> id aliis quoque nationibus arduum apud Germanos difficilius tolerabatur , quis ingentium beluarum feraces saltus , modica domi armenta sunt . <end>$$<start> This would have been hard for any nation , and it was the less tolerable to the Germans , whose forests abound in huge beasts , while their home cattle are undersized . <end>
<start> ac primo boves ipsos , mox agros , postremo corpora coniugum aut liberorum servitio tradebant . <end>$$<start> First it was their herds , next their lands , last , the persons of their wives and children , which they gave up to bondage . <end>
<start> hinc ira et questus et postquam non subveniebatur remedium ex bello . <end>$$<start> Then came angry remonstrances , and when they received no relief , they sought a remedy in war . <end>
<start> rapti qui tributo aderant milites et patibulo adfixi Olennius infensos fuga praevenit receptus castello cui nomen Flevum . <end>$$<start> The soldiers appointed to collect the tribute were seized and gibbeted . <end>
<start> Quod ubi Lucius Apronio inferioris Germaniae pro praetore cognitum , vexilla legionum e superiore provincia peditumque et equitum auxiliarium delectos accivit ac simul utrumque exercitum Rheno devectum Frisiis intulit , soluto iam castelli obsidio et ad sua tutanda degressis rebellibus . <end>$$<start> As soon as this was known to Lucius Apronius , propraetor of Lower Germany , he summoned from the Upper province the legionary veterans , as well as some picked auxiliary infantry and cavalry . <end>
<start> igitur proxima aestuaria aggeribus et pontibus traducendo graviori agmini firmat , atque interim repertis vadis alam Canninefatem et quod peditum Germanorum inter nostros merebat circumgredi terga hostium iubet , qui iam acie compositi pellunt turmas socialis equitesque legionum subsidio missos . <end>$$<start> Instantly conveying both armies down the Rhine , he threw them on the Frisii , raising at once the siege of the fortress and dispersing the rebels in defence of their own possessions . <end>
<start> tum tres leves cohortes ac rursum duae , dein tempore interiecto alarius eques immissus satis validi si simul incubuissent , per intervallum adventantes neque constantiam addiderant turbatis et pavore fugientium auferebantur . <end>$$<start> Next , he began constructing solid roads and bridges over the neighbouring estuaries for the passage of his heavy troops , and meanwhile having found a ford , he ordered the cavalry of the Canninefates , with all the German infantry which served with us , to take the enemy in the rear . <end>
<start> prorumpunt quintani ante alios et acri pugna hoste pulso recipiunt cohortis alasque fessas vulneribus . <end>$$<start> The soldiers of the fifth sprang forward , drove back the enemy in a fierce encounter , and saved our cohorts and cavalry , who were exhausted by their wounds . <end>
<start> neque dux Romanus ultum iit aut corpora humavit , quamquam multi tribunorum praefectorumque et insignes centuriones cecidissent . <end>$$<start> But the Roman general did not attempt vengeance or even bury the dead , although many tribunes , prefects , and first-rank centurions had fallen . <end>
<start> mox compertum a transfugis nongentos Romanorum apud lucum quem Baduhennae vocant pugna in posterum extracta confectos , et aliam quadringentorum manum occupata Cruptorigis quondam stipendiari villa , postquam proditio metuebatur , mutuis ictibus procubuisse . <end>$$<start> Soon afterwards it was ascertained from deserters that nine hundred Romans had been cut to pieces in a wood called Braduhenna's , after prolonging the fight to the next day , and that another body of four hundred , which had taken possession of the house of one Cruptorix , once a soldier in our pay , fearing betrayal , had perished by mutual slaughter . <end>
<start> Clarum inde inter Germanos Frisium nomen , dissimulante Tiberio damna ne cui bellum permitteret . <end>$$<start> The Frisian name thus became famous in Germany , and Tiberius kept our losses a secret , not wishing to entrust any one with the war . <end>
<start> neque senatus in eo cura an imperii extrema dehonestarentur pavor internus occupaverat animos cui remedium adulatione quaerebatur . <end>$$<start> Nor did the Senate care whether dishonour fell on the extreme frontiers of the empire . <end>
<start> ita quamquam diversis super rebus consulerentur , aram clementiae , aram amicitiae effigiesque circum Caesaris ac Seiani censuere crebrisque precibus efflagitabant visendi sui copiam facerent . <end>$$<start> Fear at home had filled their hearts , and for this they sought relief in sycophancy And so , although their advice was asked on totally different subjects , they decreed an altar to Clemency , an altar to Friendship , and statues round them to Caesar and Sejanus , both of whom they earnestly begged with repeated entreaties to allow themselves to be seen in public . <end>
<start> non illi tamen in urbem aut propinqua urbi degressi sunt satis visum omittere insulam et in proximo Campaniae aspici . <end>$$<start> Still , neither of them would visit Rome or even the neighbourhood of Rome . <end>
<start> eo venire patres , eques , magna pars plebis , anxii erga Seianum cuius durior congressus atque eo per ambitum et societate consiliorum parabatur . <end>$$<start> they thought it enough to quit the island and show themselves on the opposite shores of Campania . <end>
<start> quippe Romae sueti discursus et magnitudine urbis incertum quod quisque ad negotium pergat ibi campo aut litore iacentes nullo discrimine noctem ac diem iuxta gratiam aut fastus ianitorum perpetiebantur donec id quoque vetitum et revenere in urbem trepidi quos non sermone , non visu dignatus erat , quidam male alacres quibus infaustae amicitiae gravis exitus imminebat . <end>$$<start> but there , as they lounged in promiscuous crowds in the fields or on the shore , they had to bear day and night alike the patronising smiles and the supercilious insolence of hall-porters , till even this was forbidden them , and those whom Sejanus had not deigned to accost or to look on , returned to the capital in alarm , while some felt an evil joy , though there hung over them the dreadful doom of that ill-starred friendship . <end>
<start> Rubellio et Fufio consulibus , quorum utrique Geminus cognomentum erat , Iulia Augusta mortem obiit , aetate s extrema , nobilitatis per Claudiam familiam et adoptione Liviorum Iuliorumque clarissimae . <end>$$<start> IN the consulship of Rubellius and Fufius , both of whom had the surname Geminus , died in an advanced old age Julia Augusta . <end>
<start> primum ei matrimonium et liberi fuere cum Tiberio Nerone , qui bello Perusino profugus pace inter Sex . <end>$$<start> A Claudia by birth and by adoption a Livia and a Julia , she united the noblest blood of Rome . <end>
<start> exim Caesar cupidine formae aufert marito , incertum an invitam , adeo properus ut ne spatio quidem ad enitendum dato penatibus suis gravidam induxerit . <end>$$<start> So impatient was he that he brought her to his house actually pregnant , not allowing time for her confinement . <end>
<start> nullam posthac subolem edidit sed sanguini Augusti per coniunctionem Agrippinae et Germanici adnexa communis pronepotes habuit . <end>$$<start> She had no subsequent issue , but allied as she was through the marriage of Agrippina and Germanicus to the blood of Augustus , her great-grandchildren were also his . <end>
<start> sanctitate domus priscum ad morem , comis ultra quam antiquis feminis probatum , mater impotens , uxor facilis et cum artibus mariti , simulatione filii bene composita . <end>$$<start> In the purity of her home life she was of the ancient type , but was more gracious than was thought fitting in ladies of former days . <end>
<start> At Tiberius , quod supremis in matrem officiis defuisset , nihil mutata amoenitate vitae , magnitudinem negotiorum per litteras excusavit honoresque memoriae eius ab senatu large decretos quasi per modestiam imminuit , paucis admodum receptis et addito ne caelestis religio decerneretur sic ipsam maluisse . <end>$$<start> Tiberius however , making no change in his voluptuous life , excused himself by letter for his absence from his last duty to his mother on the ground of the pressure of business . <end>
<start> is gratia Augustae floruerat , aptus adliciendis feminarum animis , dicax idem et Tiberium acerbis facetiis inridere solitus quarum apud praepotentis in longum memoria est . <end>$$<start> he was witty too , and accustomed to ridicule Tiberius with those bitter jests which the powerful remember so long . <end>
<start> Ceterum ex eo praerupta iam et urgens dominatio nam incolumi Augusta erat adhuc perfugium , quia Tiberio inveteratum erga matrem obsequium neque Seianus audebat auctoritati parentis antire tunc velut frenis exoluti proruperunt missaeque in Agrippinam ac Neronem litterae quas pridem adlatas et cohibitas ab Augusta credidit vulgus haud enim multum post mortem eius recitatae sunt . <end>$$<start> This at all events was the beginning of an unmitigated and grinding despotism As long indeed as Augusta lived , there yet remained a refuge , for with Tiberius obedience to his mother was the habit of a life , and Sejanus did not dare to set himself above a parent's authority . <end>
<start> verba inerant quaesita asperitate sed non arma , non rerum novarum studium , amores iuvenum et impudicitiam nepoti obiectabat . <end>$$<start> A letter was sent , directed against Agrippina and Nero , which was popularly believed to have been long before forwarded and to have been kept back by Augusta , as it was publicly read soon after her death . <end>
<start> in nurum ne id quidem confingere ausus , adrogantiam oris et contumacem animum incusavit , magno senatus pavore ac silentio , donec pauci quis nulla ex honesto spes (et publica mala singulis in occasionem gratiae trahuntur) ut referretur postulavere , promptissimo Cotta Messalino cum atroci sententia . <end>$$<start> It contained expressions of studied harshness , yet it was not armed rebellion or a longing for revolution , but unnatural passions and profligacy which the emperor imputed to his grandson . <end>
<start> Fuit in senatu Iunius Rusticus , componendis patrum actis delectus a Caesare eoque meditationes eius introspicere creditus . <end>$$<start> There was in the Senate one Junius Rusticus , who having been appointed by the emperor to register its debates was therefore supposed to have an insight into his secret purposes . <end>
<start> is fatali quodam motu (neque enim ante specimen constantiae dederat) seu prava sollertia , dum imminentium oblitus incerta pavet , inserere se dubitantibus ac monere consules ne relationem inciperent . <end>$$<start> He argued that the highest issues turned on trivial causes , and that the fall of the house of Germanicus might one day move the old man's remorse . <end>
<start> ferebantur etiam sub nominibus consularium fictae in Seianum sententiae , exercentibus plerisque per occultum atque eo procacius libidinem ingeniorum . <end>$$<start> Consequently the wrath of Sejanus was the more furious , and he had ground for alleging that the Senate disregarded the emperor's trouble . <end>
<start> unde illi ira violentior et materies criminandi spretum dolorem principis ab senatu , descivisse populum . <end>$$<start> that the people were in revolt that speeches in a new style and new resolutions were being heard and read . <end>
<start> Igitur Caesar repetitis adversum nepotem et nurum probris increpitaque per edictum plebe , questus apud patres quod fraude unius senatoris imperatoria maiestas elusa publice foret , integra tamen sibi cuncta postulavit . <end>$$<start> Upon this the emperor , after repeating his invectives against his grandson and his daughter-in-law and reprimanding the populace in an edict complained to the Senate that by the trick of one senator the imperial dignity had been publicly flouted , and he insisted that , after all , the whole matter should be left to his exclusive decision . <end>
