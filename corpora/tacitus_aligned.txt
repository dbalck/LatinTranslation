 dictaturae ad tempus sumebantur$$ Dictatorships were held for a temporary crisis

 Tiberii Gaique et Claudii ac Neronis res florentibus ipsis ob metum falsae , postquam occiderant , recentibus odiis compositae sunt$$ The histories of Tiberius ,  Caius ,  Claudius ,  and Nero ,  while they were in power ,  were falsified through terror ,  and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred
 inde consilium mihi pauca de Augusto et extrema tradere , mox Tiberii principatum et cetera , sine ira et studio , quorum causas procul habeo$$ Hence my purpose is to relate a few facts about Augustus , more particularly his last acts ,  then the reign of Tiberius ,  and all which follows ,  without either bitterness or partiality ,  from any motives to which I am far removed
 Postquam Bruto et Cassio caesis nulla iam publica arma , Pompeius apud Siciliam oppressus exutoque Lepido , interfecto Antonio ne Iulianis quidem partibus nisi Caesar dux reliquus , posito triumviri nomine consulem se ferens et ad tuendam plebem tribunicio iure contentum , ubi militem donis , populum annona , cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit , insurgere paulatim , munia senatus magistratuum legum in se trahere , nullo adversante , cum ferocissimi per acies aut proscriptione cecidissent , ceteri nobilium , quanto quis servitio promptior , opibus et honoribus extollerentur ac novis ex rebus aucti tuta et praesentia quam vetera et periculosa mallent$$ When after the destruction of Brutus and Cassius there was no longer any army of the Commonwealth ,  when Pompeius was crushed in Sicily ,  and when ,  with Lepidus pushed aside and Antonius slain ,  even the Julian faction had only Caesar left to lead it ,  then ,  dropping the title of triumvir ,  and giving out that he was a Consul ,  and was satisfied with a tribune's authority for the protection of the people ,  Augustus won over the soldiers with gifts ,  the populace with cheap corn ,  and all men with the sweets of repose ,  and so grew greater by degrees ,  while he concentrated in himself the functions of the Senate ,  the magistrates ,  and the laws He was wholly unopposed ,  for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle ,  or in the proscription ,  while the remaining nobles ,  the readier they were to be slaves ,  were raised the higher by wealth and promotion ,  so that ,  aggrandised by revolution ,  they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past
 neque provinciae illum rerum statum abnuebant , suspecto senatus populique imperio ob certamina potentium et avaritiam magistratuum , invalido legum auxilio quae vi ambitu postremo pecunia turbabantur$$ Nor did the provinces dislike that condition of affairs ,  for they distrusted the government of the Senate and the people ,  because of the rivalries between the leading men and the rapacity of the officials ,  while the protection of the laws was unavailing ,  as they were continually deranged by violence ,  intrigue ,  and finally by corruption
 Ceterum Augustus subsidia dominationi Claudium Marcellum sororis filium admodum adulescentem pontificatu et curuli aedilitate , Marcus Agrippam ignobilem loco , bonum militia et victoriae socium , geminatis consulatibus extulit , mox defuncto Marcello generum sumpsit$$ Augustus meanwhile ,  as supports to his despotism ,  raised to the pontificate and curule aedileship Claudius Marcellus ,  his sister's son ,  while a mere stripling ,  and Marcus Agrippa ,  of humble birth ,  a good soldier ,  and one who had shared his victory ,  to two consecutive consulships ,  and as Marcellus soon afterwards died ,  he also accepted him as his son-in-law
 Tiberium Neronem et Claudium Drusum privignos imperatoriis nominibus auxit , integra etiam tum domo sua$$ Tiberius Nero and Claudius Drusus ,  his stepsons ,  he honoured with imperial tides ,  although his own family was as yet undiminished
 nam genitos Agrippa Gaium ac Lucium in familiam Caesarum induxerat , necdum posita puerili praetexta principes iuventutis appellari , destinari consules specie recusantis flagrantissime cupiverat$$ For he had admitted the children of Agrippa ,  Caius and Lucius ,  into the house of the Caesars and before they had yet laid aside the dress of boyhood he had most fervently desired ,  with an outward show of reluctance ,  that they should be entitled princes of the youth ,  and be consuls-elect
 ut Agrippa vita concessit , Lucium Caesarem euntem ad Hispaniensis exercitus , Gaium remeantem Armenia et vulnere invalidum mors fato propera vel novercae Liviae dolus abstulit , Drusoque pridem extincto Nero solus e privignis erat , illuc cuncta vergere$$ When Agrippa died ,  and Lucius Caesar as he was on his way to our armies in Spain ,  and Caius while returning from Armenia ,  still suffering from a wound ,  were prematurely cut off by destiny ,  or by their step-mother Livia's treachery ,  Drusus too having long been dead ,  Nero remained alone of the stepsons ,  and in him everything tended to centre
 filius , collega imperii , consors tribuniciae potestatis adsumitur omnisque per exercitus ostentatur , non obscuris , ut antea , matris artibus , sed palam hortatu$$ He was adopted as a son ,  as a colleague in empire and a partner in the tribunitian power ,  and paraded through all the armies ,  no longer through his mother's secret intrigues ,  but at her open suggestion
 nam senem Augustum devinxerat adeo , uti nepotem unicum Agrippam Postumum , in insulam Planasiam proiecerit , rudem sane bonarum artium et robore corporis stolide ferocem , nullius tamen flagitii conpertum$$ For she had gained such a hold on the aged Augustus that he drove out as an exile into the island of Planasia ,  his only grandson ,  Agrippa Postumus ,  who ,  though devoid of worthy qualities ,  and having only the brute courage of physical strength ,  had not been convicted of any gross offence
 at hercule Germanicum Druso ortum octo apud Rhenum legionibus inposuit adscirique per adoptionem a Tiberio iussit , quamquam esset in domo Tiberii filius iuvenis , sed quo pluribus munimentis insisteret$$ And yet Augustus had appointed Germanicus ,  Drusus's offspring ,  to the command of eight legions on the Rhine ,  and required Tiberius to adopt him ,  although Tiberius had a son ,  now a young man ,  in his house
 bellum ea tempestate nullum nisi adversus Germanos supererat , abolendae magis infamiae ob amissum cum Quintilio Varo exercitum quam cupidine proferendi imperii aut dignum ob praemium$$ but he did it that he might have several safeguards to rest on He had no war at the time on his hands except against the Germans ,  which was rather to wipe out the disgrace of the loss of Quintilius Varus and his army than out of an ambition to extend the empire ,  or for any adequate recompense

 utcumque se ea res habuit , vixdum ingressus Illyricum Tiberius properis matris litteris accitur neque satis conpertum est , spirantem adhuc Augustum apud urbem Nolam an exanimem reppererit$$ Whatever the fact was ,  Tiberius as he was just entering Illyria was summoned home by an urgent letter from his mother ,  and it has not been thoroughly ascertained whether at the city of Nola he found Augustus still breathing or quite lifeless
 acribus namque custodiis domum et vias saepserat Livia , laetique interdum nuntii vulgabantur , donec provisis quae tempus monebat simul excessisse Augustum et rerum potiri Neronem fama eadem tulit$$ For Livia had surrounded the house and its approaches with a strict watch ,  and favourable bulletins were published from time to time ,  till ,  provision having been made for the demands of the crisis ,  one and the same report told men that Augustus was dead and that Tiberius Nero was master of the State
 At Romae ruere in servitium consules , patres , eques$$ Meanwhile at Rome people plunged into slavery , consuls ,  senators ,  knights

 ne edictum quidem , quo patres in curiam vocabat , nisi tribuniciae potestatis praescriptione posuit sub Augusto acceptae$$ Even the proclamation by which he summoned the senators to their chamber ,  he issued merely with the title of Tribune ,  which he had received under Augustus
 verba edicti fuere pauca et sensu permodesto$$ The wording of the proclamation was brief ,  and in a very modest tone

 causa praecipua ex formidine , ne Germanicus , in cuius manu tot legiones , immensa sociorum auxilia , mirus apud populum favor , habere imperium quam exspectare mallet$$ His chief motive was fear that Germanicus ,  who had at his disposal so many legions ,  such vast auxiliary forces of the allies ,  and such wonderful popularity ,  might prefer the possession to the expectation of empire
 dabat et famae , ut vocatus electusque potius a re publica videretur quam per uxorium ambitum et senili adoptione inrepsisse$$ He looked also at public opinion ,  wishing to have the credit of having been called and elected by the State rather than of having crept into power through the intrigues of a wife and a dotard's adoption

 nam verba vultus in crimen detorquens recondebat$$ For he would twist a word or a look into a crime and treasure it up in his memory

 tum conultatum de honoribus$$ Next followed a deliberation about funeral honours

 addebat Messalla Valerius renovandum per annos sacramentum in nomen Tiberii$$ the titles of the laws passed ,  the names of the nations conquered by Augustus were to be borne in front ,  on that of Lucius Arruntius
 interrogatusque a Tiberio num se mandante eam sententiam prompsisset , sponte dixisse respondit , neque in iis quae ad rem publicam pertinerent consilio nisi suo usurum , vel cum periculo offensionis$$ Messala Valerius further proposed that the oath of allegiance to Tiberius should be yearly renewed ,  and when Tiberius asked him whether it was at his bidding that he had brought forward this motion ,  he replied that he had proposed it spontaneously ,  and that in whatever concerned the State he would use only his own discretion ,  even at the risk of offending
 ea sola species adulandi supererat$$ This was the only style of adulation which yet remained
 conclamant patres corpus ad rogum umeris senatorum ferendum$$ The Senators unanimously exclaimed that the body ought to be borne on their shoulders to the funeral pile
 remisit Caesar adroganti moderatione , populumque edicto monuit ne , ut quondam nimiis studiis funus divi Iulii turbassent , ita Augustum in foro potius quam in campo Martis , sede destinata , cremari vellent$$ The emperor left the point to them with disdainful moderation ,  he then admonished the people by a proclamation not to indulge in that tumultuous enthusiasm which had distracted the funeral of the Divine Julius ,  or express a wish that Augustus should be burnt in the Forum instead of in his appointed resting-place in the Campus Martius
 die funeris milites velut praesidio stetere , multum inridentibus qui ipsi vierant quique a parentibus acceperant diem illum crudi adhuc servitii et libertatis inprospere repetitae , cum occisus dictator Caesar aliis pessimum , aliis pulcherrimum facinus videretur$$ On the day of the funeral soldiers stood round as a guard ,  amid much ridicule from those who had either themselves witnessed or who had heard from their parents of the famous day when slavery was still something fresh ,  and freedom had been resought in vain ,  when the slaying of Caesar ,  the Dictator ,  seemed to some the vilest ,  to others ,  the most glorious of deeds
 nunc senem principem , longa potentia , provisis etiam heredum in rem publicam opibus , auxilio scilicet militari tuendum , ut sepultura eius quieta foret$$ Now ,  they said ,  an aged sovereign ,  whose power had lasted long ,  who had provided his heirs with abundant means to coerce the State ,  requires forsooth the defence of soldiers that his burial may be undisturbed
 Multus hinc ipso de Augusto sermo , plerisque vana mirantibus , quod idem dies accepti quondam imperii princeps et vitae supremus , quod Nolae in domo et cubiculo in quo pater eius Octavius vitam finivisset$$ Then followed much talk about Augustus himself ,  and many expressed an idle wonder that the same day marked the beginning of his assumption of empire and the close of his life ,  and ,  again ,  that he had ended his days at Nola in the same house and room as his father Octavius
 numerus etiam consulatuum celebrabatur , quo Valerium Corvum et Gaius Marium simul aequaverat , continuata per septem et triginta annos tribunicia potestas , nomen imperatoris semel atque viciens partum aliaque honorum mutiplicata aut nova$$ People extolled too the number of his consulships ,  in which he had equalled Valerius Corvus and Caius Marius combined ,  the continuance for thirty-seven years of the tribunitian power ,  the title of Imperator twenty-one times earned ,  and his other honours which had either frequently repeated or were wholly new
 at apud prudentes vita eius varie extollebatur arguebaturve$$ Sensible men ,  however ,  spoke variously of his life with praise and censure
 hi pietate erga parentem et necessitudine rei publicae , in qua nullus tunc legibus locus ad arma civilia actum , quae neque parari possent neque haberi per bonas artes$$ Some said that dutiful feeling towards a father ,  and the necessities of the State in which laws had then no place ,  drove him into civil war ,  which can neither be planned nor conducted on any right principles
 multa Antonio , dum interfectores patris ulcisceretur , mula Lepido concessisse$$ He had often yielded to Antonius ,  while he was taking vengeance on his father's murderers ,  often also to Lepidus
 postquam hic socordia senuerit , ille per libidines pessum datus sit , non aliud discordantis patriae remedium fuisse quam ut ab uno regeretur$$ When the latter sank into feeble dotage and the former had been ruined by his profligacy ,  the only remedy for his distracted country was the rule of a single man

 urbem ipsam magnificio ornatu$$ there was respect shown to the allies
 pauca admodum vi tractata quo ceteris quies esset$$ The capital had been embellished on a grand scale
 Dicebatur contra$$ It was said ,  on the other hand ,  that filial duty and State necessity were merely assumed as a mask
 pietatem erga parentem et tempora rei publicae obtentui sumpta ceterum cupidine dominandi concitos per largitionem veteranos , paratum ab adulescente privato exercitum , corruptas consulis legiones , simulatam Pompeianarum gratiam partium$$ It was really from a lust of sovereignty that he had excited the veterans by bribery ,  had ,  when a young man and a subject ,  raised an army ,  tampered with the Consul's legions ,  and feigned an attachment to the faction of Pompeius
 mox ubi decreto patrum fasces et ius praetoris invaserit , caesis Hirtio et Pansa , sive hostis illos , seu Pansam venenum vulneri adfusum , sui milites Hirtium et machinator doli Caesar abstulerat , utriusque copias ocupavisse extortum invito senatu consulatum , armaque quae in Antonium acceperit contra rem publicam versa$$ Then ,  when by a decree of the Senate he had usurped the high functions and authority of Praetor when Hirtius and Pansa were slain , whether they were destroyed by the enemy ,  or Pansa by poison infused into a wound ,  Hirtius by his own soldiers and Caesar's treacherous machinations , he at once possessed himself of both their armies ,  wrested the consulate from a reluctant Senate ,  and turned against the State the arms with which he had been intrusted against Antonius
 proscriptionem civium , divisiones agrorum ne ipsis quidem qui fecere laudatus$$ Citizens were proscribed ,  lands divided ,  without so much as the approval of those who executed these deeds
 sane Cassii et Brutorum exitus paternis inimicitiis datos , quamquam fas sit privata odia publicis utilitatibus remittere$$ Even granting that the deaths of Cassius and of the Bruti were sacrifices to a hereditary enmity (though duty requires us to waive private feuds for the sake of the public welfare) ,  still Pompeius had been deluded by the phantom of peace ,  and Lepidus by the mask of friendship
 sed Pompeium imagine pacis , sed Leidum specie amicitiae deceptos$$ Subsequently ,  Antonius had been lured on by the treaties of Tarentum and Brundisium ,  and by his marriage with the sister ,  and paid by his death the penalty of a treacherous alliance
 post Antonium , Tarentino Brundisinoque foedere et nuptiis sororis inlectum , subdolae adfinitatis poenas morte exsolvisse$$ No doubt ,  there was peace after all this ,  but it was a peace stained with blood
 pacem sine dubio post haec , verum cruentam$$ there were the disasters of Lollius and Varus ,  the murders at Rome of the Varros ,  Egnatii ,  and Juli
 Lollianas Varianasque clades , interfectos Romae Varrones , Egnatios , Iullos$$ The domestic life too of Augustus was not spared
 nec domesticis abstinebatur$$ Nero's wife had been taken from him ,  and there had been the farce of consulting the pontiffs ,  whether ,  with a child conceived and not yet born ,  she could properly marry
 abducta Neroni uxor et consulti per ludibrium pontifices an concepto necdum edito partu rite nuberet$$ There were the excesses of Quintus Tedius and Vedius Pollio
 Quintus +Tedii+ et Vedii Pollionis luxus$$ last of all ,  there was Livia ,  terrible to the State as a mother ,  terrible to the house of the Caesars as a stepmother
 postremo Livia gravis in rem publicam mater , gravis domui Caesarum noverca$$ No honour was left for the gods ,  when Augustus chose to be himself worshipped with temples and statues ,  like those of the deities ,  and with flamens and priests
 nihil deorum honoribus relictum , cum se templis et effigie numinum per flamines et sacerdotes coli vellet$$ He had not even adopted Tiberius as his successor out of affection or any regard to the State ,  but ,  having thoroughly seen his arrogant and savage temper ,  he had sought glory for himself by a contrast of extreme wickedness
 ne Tiberium quidem caritate aut rei publicae cura successorem adscitum , sed quoniam adrogantiam saevitiamque eius introspexerit , comparatione deterrima sibi gloriam quaesivisse$$ For ,  in fact ,  Augustus ,  a few years before ,  when he was a second time asking from the Senate the tribunitian power for Tiberius ,  though his speech was complimentary ,  had thrown out certain hints as to his manners ,  style ,  and habits of life ,  which he meant as reproaches ,  while he seemed to excuse
 etenim Augustus paucis ante annis , cum Tiberio tribuniciam potestatem a patribus rursum postularet , quamquam honora oratione quaedam de habitu cultuque et institutis eius iecerat , quae velut excusando exprobraret$$ However ,  when his obsequies had been duly performed ,  a temple with a religious ritual was decreed him
 Versae inde ad Tiberium preces$$ After this all prayers were addressed to Tiberius
 et ille varie diserebat de magnitudine imperii sua modestia$$ He ,  on his part ,  urged various considerations ,  the greatness of the empire ,  his distrust of himself
 solam divi Augusti mentem tantae molis capacem$$ Only ,  he said ,  the intellect of the Divine Augustus was equal to such a burden
 se in partem curarum ab illo vocatum experiendo didicisse quam arduum , quam subiectum fortunae regendi cuncta onus$$ Called as he had been by him to share his anxieties ,  he had learnt by experience how exposed to fortune's caprices was the task of universal rule
 proinde in civitate tot inlustribus viris subnixa non ad unum omnia deferrent plures facilius munia rei publicae sociatis laboribus exsecuturos$$ Consequently ,  in a state which had the support of so many great men ,  they should not put everything on one man ,  as many ,  by uniting their efforts would more easily discharge public functions
 plus in oratione tali dignitatis quam fidei erat$$ There was more grand sentiment than good faith in such words
 Tiberioque etiam in rebus quas non occuleret , seu natura sive adsuetudine , suspensa semper et obscura verba tunc vero nitenti ut sensus suos penitus abderet , in incertum et ambiguum magis implicabantur$$ Tiberius's language even in matters which he did not care to conceal ,  either from nature or habit ,  was always hesitating and obscure ,  and now that he was struggling to hide his feelings completely ,  it was all the more involved in uncertainty and doubt
 at patres , quibus unus metus si intellegere viderentur , in questus lacrimas vota effundi$$ The Senators ,  however ,  whose only fear was lest they might seem to understand him ,  burst into complaints ,  tears ,  and prayers
 ad deos , ad effigiem Augusti , ad genua ipsius o manus tendere , cum proferri libellum recitarique iussit$$ They raised their hands to the gods ,  to the statue of Augustus ,  and to the knees of Tiberius ,  when he ordered a document to be produced and read
 opes publicae continebantur , quantum civium sociorumque in armis , quot classes , regna , provinciae , tributa aut vectigalia , et necessitates ac largitiones$$ This contained a description of the resources of the State ,  of the number of citizens and allies under arms ,  of the fleets ,  subject kingdoms ,  provinces ,  taxes ,  direct and indirect ,  necessary expenses and customary bounties
 quae cuncta sua manu perscripserat Augustus addideratque consilium coercendi intra terminos imperii , incertum metu an per invidiam$$ All these details Augustus had written with his own hand ,  and had added a counsel ,  that the empire should be confined to its present limits ,  either from fear or out of jealousy
 Post quae Lucius Arruntius haud multum discrepans a Galli oratione perinde offendit , quamquam Tiberio nulla vetus in Arruntium ira$$ Next ,  Lucius Arruntius ,  who differed but little from the speech of Gallus ,  gave like offence ,  though Tiberius had no old grudge against him ,  but simply mistrusted him ,  because he was rich and daring ,  had brilliant accomplishments ,  and corresponding popularity
 sed divitem , promptum , artibus egregiis et pari fama publice , suspectabat quippe Augustus supremis sermonibus cum tractaret quinam adipisci principem locum suffecturi abnuerent aut inpares vellent vel idem possent cuperentque , M Lepidum dixerat capacem sed aspernantem , Gallum Asinium avidum et minorem , Lucius Arruntium non indignum et si casus daretur ausurum$$ For Augustus ,  when in his last conversations he was discussing who would refuse the highest place ,  though sufficiently capable ,  who would aspire to it without being equal to it ,  and who would unite both the ability and ambition ,  had described Marcus Lepidus as able but contemptuously indifferent ,  Gallus Asinius as ambitious and incapable ,  Lucius Arruntius as not unworthy of it ,  and ,  should the chance be given him ,  sure to make the venture
 de prioribus consentitur , pro Arruntio quidam Gnaeus Pisonem tradidere omnesque praeter Lepidum variis mox criminibus struente Tiberio circumventi sunt$$ About the two first there is a general agreement ,  but instead of Arruntius some have mentioned Cneius Piso ,  and all these men ,  except Lepidus ,  were soon afterwards destroyed by various charges through the contrivance of Tiberius
 etiam Quintus Haterius et Mamercus Scaurus suspicacem animum perstrinxere , Haterius cum dixis set quo usque patieris , Caesar , non adesse caput rei publicae$$ Quintus Haterius too and Mamercus Scaurus ruffled his suspicious temper ,  Haterius by having said , How long ,  Caesar ,  will you suffer the State to be without a head
 Scaurus quia dixerat spem esse ex eo non inritas fore senatus preces quod relationi consulum iure tribuniciae potestatis non intercessisset$$ Scaurus by the remark that there was a hope that the Senate's prayers would not be fruitless ,  seeing that he had not used his right as Tribune to negative the motion of the Consuls
 in Haterium statim invectus est$$ Tiberius instantly broke out into invective against Haterius
 Scaurum , cui inplacabilius irascebatur , silentio tramisit$$ Scaurus ,  with whom he was far more deeply displeased ,  he passed over in silence
 fessusque clamore omnium , expostulatione singulorum flexit paulatim , non ut fateretur suscipi a se imperium , sed ut negare et rogari desineret$$ Wearied at last by the assembly's clamorous importunity and the urgent demands of individual Senators ,  he gave way by degrees ,  not admitting that he undertook empire ,  but yet ceasing to refuse it and to be entreated
 constat Haterium , cum deprecandi causa Palatium introisset ambulantisque Tiberii genua advolveretur , prope a militibus interfectum quia Tiberius casu an manibus eius inpeditus prociderat$$ It is known that Haterius having entered the palace to ask pardon ,  and thrown himself at the knees of Tiberius as he was walking ,  was almost killed by the soldiers ,  because Tiberius fell forward ,  accidentally or from being entangled by the suppliant's hands
 neque tamen periculo talis viri mitigatus est , donec Haterius Augustam oraret eiusque curatissimis precibus protegeretur$$ Yet the peril of so great a man did not make him relent ,  till Haterius went with entreaties to Augusta ,  and was saved by her very earnest intercessions
 Tum primum e campo comitia ad patres translata sunt$$ It was then for the first time that the elections were transferred from the Campus Martius to the Senate
 nam ad eam diem , etsi potissima arbitrio principis , quaedam tamen studiis tribuum fiebant$$ For up to that day ,  though the most important rested with the emperor's choice ,  some were settled by the partialities of the tribes
 neque populus ademptum ius questus est nisi inani rumore , et senatus largitionibus ac precibus sordidis exsolutus libens tenuit , moderante Tiberio ne plures quam quattuor candidatos commendaret sine repulsa et ambitu designandos$$ Nor did the people complain of having the right taken from them ,  except in mere idle talk ,  and the Senate ,  being now released from the necessity of bribery and of degrading solicitations ,  gladly upheld the change ,  Tiberius confining himself to the recommendation of only four candidates who were to be nominated without rejection or canvass
 inter quae tribuni plebei petivere ut proprio sumptu ederent ludos qui de nomine Augusti fastis additi Augustales vocarentur$$ Meanwhile the tribunes of the people asked leave to exhibit at their own expense games to be named after Augustus and added to the Calendar as the Augustales
 sed decreta pecunia ex aerario , utque per circum triumphali veste uterentur curru vehi haud permissum$$ Money was ,  however ,  voted from the exchequer ,  and though the use of the triumphal robe in the circus was prescribed ,  it was not allowed them to ride in a chariot
 mox celebratio annua ad praetorem translata cui inter civis et peregrinos iurisdictio evenisset$$ Soon the annual celebration was transferred to the praetor ,  to whose lot fell the administration of justice between citizens and foreigners
 Postremo promptis iam et aliis seditionis ministris velut contionabundus interrogabat cur paucis centurionibus paucioribus tribunis in modum servorum oboedirent$$ At last ,  when there were others ready to be abettors of a mutiny ,  he asked ,  in the tone of a demagogue ,  why ,  like slaves ,  they submitted to a few centurions and still fewer tribunes
 quando ausuros exposcere remedia , nisi novum et nutantem adhuc principem precibus vel armis adirent$$ When ,  he said ,  will you dare to demand relief ,  if you do not go with your prayers or arms to a new and yet tottering throne
 satis per tot annos ignavia peccatum , quod tricena aut quadragena stipendia senes et plerique truncato ex vulneribus corpore tolerent$$ We have blundered enough by our tameness for so many years ,  in having to endure thirty or forty campaigns till we grow old ,  most of us with bodies maimed by wounds
 ne dimissis quidem finem esse militiae , sed apud vexillum tendentis alio vocabulo eosdem labores perferre$$ Even dismissal is not the end of our service ,  but ,  quartered under a legion's standard we toil through the same hardships under another title
 ac si quis tot casus vita superaverit , trahi adhuc diversas in terras ubi per nomen agrorum uligines paludum vel inculta montium accipiant$$ If a soldier survives so many risks ,  he is still dragged into remote regions where ,  under the name of lands ,  he receives soaking swamps or mountainous wastes
 enimvero militiam ipsam gravem , infructuosam$$ Assuredly ,  military service itself is burdensome and unprofitable
 denis in diem assibus animam et corpus aestimari$$ ten ases a day is the value set on life and limb
 hinc vestem arma tentoria , hinc saevitiam centurionum et vacationes munerum redimi$$ out of this ,  clothing ,  arms ,  tents ,  as well as the mercy of centurions and exemptions from duty have to be purchased
 at hercule verbera et vulnera , duram hiemem , exercitas aestates , bellum atrox$$ But indeed of floggings and wounds ,  of hard winters ,  wearisome summers ,  of terrible war ,  or barren peace ,  there is no end
 aut sterilem pacem sempiterna nec aliud levamentum quam si certis sub legibus militia iniretur , ut singulos denarios mererent , sextus decumus stipendii annus finem adferret , ne ultra sub vexillis tenerentur , sed isdem in castris praemium pecunia solveretur$$ Our only relief can come from military life being entered on under fixed conditions ,  from receiving each the pay of a denarius ,  and from the sixteenth year terminating our service We must be retained no longer under a standard ,  but in the same camp a compensation in money must be paid us
 an praetorias cohortis , quae binos denarios acceperint , quae post sedecim annos penatibus suis reddantur , plus periculorum suscipere$$ Do the praetorian cohorts ,  which have just got their two denarii per man ,  and which after sixteen years are restored to their homes ,  encounter more perils
 non obtrectari a se urbanas excubias$$ We do not disparage the guards of the capital
 sibi tamen apud horridas gentis e contuberniis hostem aspici$$ still ,  here amid barbarous tribes we have to face the enemy from our tents
 Adstrepebat vulgus , diversis incitamentis , hi verberum notas , illi canitiem , plurimi detrita tegmina et nudum corpus exprobrantes$$ The throng applauded from various motives ,  some pointing with indignation to the marks of the lash ,  others to their grey locks ,  and most of them to their threadbare garments and naked limbs
 postremo eo furoris venere ut tres legiones miscere in unam agitaverint$$ At ,  last ,  in their fury they went so far as to propose to combine the three legions into one
 depulsi aemulatione , quia suae quisque legioni eum honorem quaerebant , alio vertunt atque una tres aquilas et signa cohortium locant$$ Driven from their purpose by the jealousy with which every one sought the chief honour for his own legion ,  they turned to other thoughts ,  and set up in one spot the three eagles ,  with the ensigns of the cohorts
 simul congerunt caespites , exstruunt tribunal , quo magis conspicua sedes foret$$ At the same time they piled up turf and raised a mound ,  that they might have a more conspicuous meeting-place
 properantibus Blaesus advenit , increpabatque ac retinebat singulos , clamitans mea potius caede imbuite manus$$ Amid the bustle Blaesus came up He upbraided them and held back man after man with the exclamation ,  Better imbrue your hands in my blood 
 leviore flagitio legatum interficietis quam ab imperatore desciscitis$$  it will be less guilt to slay your commander than it is to be in revolt from the emperor
 aut incolumis fidem legionum retinebo aut iugulatus paenitentiam adcelerabo$$ Either living I will uphold the loyalty of the legions ,  or pierced to the heart I will hasten on your repentance
 Aggerabatur nihilo minus caespes iamque pectori usque adcreverat , cum tandem pervicacia victi inceptum omisere$$ None the less however was the mound piled up ,  and it was quite breast high when ,  at last overcome by his persistency ,  they gave up their purpose
 Blaesus multa dicendi arte non per seditionem et turbas desideria militum ad Caesarem ferenda ait , neque veteres ab imperatoribus priscis neque ipsos a divo Augusto tam nova petivisse$$ Blaesus ,  with the consummate tact of an orator ,  said ,  It is not through mutiny and tumult that the desires of the army ought to be communicated to Caesar ,  nor did our soldiers of old ever ask so novel a boon of ancient commanders ,  nor have you yourselves asked it of the Divine Augustus
 et parum in tempore incipientis principis curas onerari$$ It is far from opportune that the emperor's cares ,  now in their first beginning ,  should be aggravated
 si tamen tenderent in pace temptare quae ne civilium quidem bellorum victores expostulaverint cur contra morem obsequii , contra fas disciplinae vim meditentur$$ If ,  however ,  you are bent upon attempting in peace what even after your victory in the civil wars you did not demand ,  why ,  contrary to the habit of obedience ,  contrary to the law of discipline ,  do you meditate violence
 decernerent legatos seque coram mandata darent$$ Decide on sending envoys ,  and give them instructions in your presence
 adclamavere ut filius Blaesi tribunus legatione ea fungeretur peteretque militibus missionem ab sedecim annis$$ It was carried by acclamation that the son of Blaesus ,  one of the tribunes ,  should undertake the mission ,  and demand for the soldiers release from service after sixteen years
 cetera mandaturos ubi prima provenissent$$ He was to have the rest of their message when the first part had been successful
 profecto iuvene modi cum otium sed superbire miles quod filius legati orator publicae causae satis ostenderet necessitate expressa quae per modestiam non obtinuissent$$ After the young man departure there was comparative quiet ,  but there was an arrogant tone among the soldiers ,  to whom the fact that their commander's son was pleading their common cause clearly showed that they had wrested by compulsion what they had failed to obtain by good behaviour
 Interea manipuli ante coeptam seditionem Nauportum missi ob itinera et pontes et alios usus , postquam turbatum in castris accepere , vexilla convellunt direptisque proximis vicis ipsoque Nauporto , quod municipii instar erat , retinentis centuriones inrisu et contumeliis , postremo verberibus insectantur , praecipua in Aufidienum Rufum praefectum castrorum ira , quem dereptum vehiculo sarcinis gravant aguntque primo in agmine per ludibrium rogitantes an tam immensa onera , tam longa itinera libenter ferret$$ Meanwhile the companies which previous to the mutiny had been sent to Nauportus to make roads and bridges and for other purposes ,  when they heard of the tumult in the camp ,  tore up the standards ,  and having plundered the neighbouring villages and Nauportus itself ,  which was like a town ,  assailed the centurions who restrained them with jeers and insults ,  last of all ,  with blows Their chief rage was against Aufidienus Rufus ,  the camp-prefect ,  whom they dragged from a waggon ,  loaded with baggage ,  and drove on at the head of the column ,  asking him in ridicule whether he liked to bear such huge burdens and such long marches
 quippe Rufus diu manipularis , dein centurio , mox castris praefectus , antiquam duramque militiam revocabat , vetus operis ac laboris et eo inmitior quia toleraverat$$ Rufus ,  who had long been a common soldier ,  then a centurion ,  and subsequently camp-prefect ,  tried to revive the old severe discipline ,  inured as he was to work and toil ,  and all the sterner because he had endured
 Horum adventu redintegratur seditio et vagi circumiecta populabantur$$ On the arrival of these troops the mutiny broke out afresh ,  and straggling from the camp they plundered the neighbourhood
 Blaesus paucos , maxime praeda onustos , ad terrorem ceterorum adfici verberibus , claudi carcere iubet$$ Blaesus ordered a few who had conspicuously loaded themselves with spoil to be scourged and imprisoned as a terror to the rest
 nam etiam tum legato a centurionibus et optimo quoque manipularium parebatur$$ for ,  even as it then was ,  the commander was still obeyed by the centurions and by all the best men among the soldiers
 illi obniti trahentibus , prensare circumstantium genua , ciere modo nomina singulorum , modo centuriam quisque cuius manipularis erat , cohortem , legionem , eadem omnibus inminere clamitantes$$ As the men were dragged off ,  they struggled violently ,  clasped the knees of the bystanders ,  called to their comrades by name ,  or to the company ,  cohort ,  or legion to which they respectively belonged ,  exclaiming that all were threatened with the same fate
 simul probra in legatum cumulant , caelum ac deos obtestantur , nihil reliqui faciunt quo minus invidiam misericordiam metum et iras permoverent$$ At the same time they heaped abuse on the commander they appealed to heaven and to the gods ,  and left nothing undone by which they might excite resentment and pity ,  alarm and rage
 adcurritur ab universis , et carcere effracto solvunt vincula desertoresque ac rerum capitalium damnatos sibi iam miscent$$ They all rushed to the spot ,  broke open the guardhouse ,  unbound the prisoners ,  and were in a moment fraternising with deserters and men convicted on capital charges
 Incendebat haec fletu et pectus atque os manibus verberans$$ He inflamed their excitement by weeping and smiting his breast and face with his hands
 mox disiectis quorum per umeros sustinebatur , praeceps et singulorum pedibus advolutus tantum consternationis invidiaeque concivit , ut pars militum gladiatores , qui e servitio Blaesi erant , pars ceteram eiusdem familiam vincirent , alii ad quaerendum corpus effunderentur$$ Then ,  hurling aside those who bore him on their shoulders ,  and impetuously flinging himself at the feet of one man after another ,  he roused such dismay and indignation that some of the soldiers put fetters on the gladiators who were among the number of Blaesus's slaves ,  others did the like to the rest of his household ,  while a third party hurried out to look for the corpse
 ac ni propere neque corpus ullum reperiri , et servos adhibitis cruciatibus abnuere caedem , neque illi fuisse umquam fratrem pernotuisset , haud multum ab exitio legati aberant$$ And had it not quickly been known that no corpse was found ,  that the slaves ,  when tortures were applied ,  denied the murder ,  and that the man never had a brother ,  they would have been on the point of destroying the general
 tribunos tamen ac praefectum castrorum extrusere , sarcinae fugientium direptae , et centurio Lucilius interficitur cui militaribus facetiis vocabulum cedo alteram indiderant , quia fracta vite in tergo militis alteram clara voce ac rursus aliam poscebat$$ As it was ,  they thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect they plundered the baggage of the fugitives ,  and they killed a centurion ,  Lucilius ,  to whom ,  with soldiers' humour ,  they had given the name Bring another ,  because when he had broken one vine-stick on a man's back ,  he would call in a loud voice for another and another
 ceteros latebrae texere , uno retento Clemente Iulio qui perferendis militum mandatis habebatur idoneus ob promptum ingenium$$ The rest sheltered themselves in concealment ,  and one only was detained ,  Clemens Julius ,  whom the soldiers considered a fit person to carry messages ,  from his ready wit
 quin ipsae inter se legiones octava et quinta decuma ferrum parabant , dum centurionem cognomento Sirpicum illa morti deposcit , quintadecumani tuentur , ni miles nonanus preces et adversum aspernantis minas interiecisset$$ Two legions ,  the eighth and the fifteenth ,  were actually drawing swords against each other ,  the former demanding the death of a centurion ,  whom they nicknamed Sirpicus ,  while the men of the fifteenth defended him ,  but the soldiers of the ninth interposed their entreaties ,  and when these were disregarded ,  their menaces
 Postquam vallum introiit , portas stationibus firmant , globos armatorum certis castrorum locis opperiri iubent$$ As soon as he entered the entrenchments ,  they secured the gates with sentries ,  and ordered bodies of armed men to be in readiness at certain points of the camp
 ceteri tribunal ingenti agmine circumveniunt$$ The rest crowded round the general's tribunal in a dense mass
 stabat Drusus silentium manu poscens$$ Drusus stood there ,  and with a gesture of his hand demanded silence
 illi quoties oculos ad multitudinem rettulerant , vocibus truculentis strepere , rursum viso Caesare trepidare$$ As often as they turned their eyes back on the throng ,  they broke into savage exclamations ,  then looking up to Drusus they trembled
 murmur incertum , atrox clamor et repente quies$$ There was a confused hum ,  a fierce shouting ,  and a sudden lull
 diversis animorum motibus pavebant terrebantque$$ Urged by conflicting emotions ,  they felt panic and they caused the like
 tandem interrupto tumultu litteras patris recitat , in quis perscriptum erat , praecipuam ipsi fortissimarum legionum curam , quibuscum plurima bella toleravisset$$ At last ,  in an interval of the uproar ,  Drusus read his father's letter ,  in which it was fully stated that he had a special care for the brave legions with which he had endured a number of campaigns
 ubi primum a luctu requiesset animus , acturum apud patres de postulatis eorum$$ that ,  as soon as his mind had recovered from its grief ,  he would lay their demands before the Senators
 misisse interim filium ut sine cunctatione concederet quae statim tribui possent cetera senatui servanda quem neque gratiae neque severitatis expertem haberi par esset$$ that meanwhile he had sent his son to concede unhesitatingly what could be immediately granted ,  and that the rest must be reserved for the Senate ,  which ought to have a voice in showing either favour or severity
 Responsum est a contione mandata Clementi centurioni quae perferret$$ The crowd replied that they had delivered their instructions to Clemens ,  one of the centurions ,  which he was to convey to Rome
 is orditur de missione a sedecim annis , de praemiis finitae militiae , ut denarius diurnum stipendium foret , ne veterani sub vexillo haberentur$$ He began to speak of the soldiers' discharge after sixteen years ,  of the rewards of completed service ,  of the daily pay being a denarius ,  and of the veterans not being detained under a standard
 ad ea Drusus cum arbitrium senatus et patris obtenderet , clamore turbatur$$ When Drusus pleaded in answer reference to the Senate and to his father ,  he was interrupted by a tumultuous shout
 cur venisset neque augendis militum stipendiis neque adlevandis laboribus , denique nulla bene faciendi licentia$$ Why had he come ,  neither to increase the soldiers' pay ,  nor to alleviate their hardships ,  in a word ,  with no power to better their lot
 at hercule verbera et necem cunctis permitti$$ Yet heaven knew that all were allowed to scourge and to execute
 Tiberium olim nomine Augusti desideria legionum frustrari solitum$$ Tiberius used formerly in the name of Augustus to frustrate the wishes of the legions ,  and the same tricks were now revived by Drusus
 easdem artis Drusum rettulisse$$ Was it only sons who were to visit them
 numquamne ad se nisi filios familiarum venturos$$ Certainly ,  it was a new thing for the emperor to refer to the Senate merely what concerned the soldier's interests
 novum id plane quod imperator sola militis commoda ad senatum reiciat$$ Was then the same Senate to be consulted whenever notice was given of an execution or of a battle
 eundem ergo senatum consulendum quotiens supplicia aut proelia indicantur$$ Were their rewards to be at the discretion of absolute rulers ,  their punishments to be without appeal
 Postremo deserunt tribunal , ut quis praetorianorum militum amicorumve Caesaris occurreret , manus intentantes , causam discordiae et initium armorum , maxime infensi Gnaeus Lentulo , quod is ante alios aetate et gloria belli firmare Drusum credebatur et illa militiae flagitia primus aspernari$$ At last they deserted the general's tribunal ,  and to any praetorian soldier or friend of Caesar's who met them ,  they used those threatening gestures which are the cause of strife and the beginning of a conflict ,  with special rage against Cneius Lentulus ,  because they thought that he above all others ,  by his age and warlike renown ,  encouraged Drusus ,  and was the first to scorn such blots on military discipline
 nec multo post digredientem cum Caesare ac provisu periculi hiberna castra repetentem circumsistunt , rogitantes quo pergeret , ad imperatorem an ad patres , ut illic quoque commodis legionum adversaretur$$ Soon after ,  as he was leaving with Drusus to betake himself in foresight of his danger to the winter camp ,  they surrounded him ,  and asked him again and again whither he was going was it to the emperor or to the Senate ,  there also to oppose the interests of the legions
 simul ingruunt , saxa iaciunt$$ At the same moment they menaced him savagely and flung stones
 iamque lapidis ictu cruentus et exitii certus adcursu multitudinis quae cum Druso advenerat protectus est$$ And now ,  bleeding from a blow ,  and feeling destruction certain ,  he was rescued by the hurried arrival of the throng which had accompanied Drusus
 Noctem minacem et in scelus erupturam fors lenivit$$ That terrible night which threatened an explosion of crime was tranquillised by a mere accident
 nam luna claro repente caelo visa languescere$$ Suddenly in a clear sky the moon's radiance seemed to die away
 id miles rationis ignarus omen praesentium accepit , suis laboribus defectionem sideris adsimulans , prospereque cessura qua pergerent si fulgor et claritudo deae redderetur$$ This the soldiers in their ignorance of the cause regarded as an omen of their condition ,  comparing the failure of her light to their own efforts ,  and imagining that their attempts would end prosperously should her brightness and splendour be restored to the goddess
 igitur aeris sono , tubarum cornuumque concentu strepere$$ And so they raised a din with brazen instruments and the combined notes of trumpets and horns ,  with joy or sorrow ,  as she brightened or grew dark
 prout splendidior obscuriorve laetari aut maerere et postquam ortae nubes offecere visui creditumque conditam tenebris , ut sunt mobiles ad superstitionem perculsae semel mentes , sibi aeternum laborem portendi , sua facinora aversari deos lamentantur$$ When clouds arose and obstructed their sight ,  and it was thought she was buried in the gloom ,  with that proneness to superstition which steals over minds once thoroughly cowed ,  they lamented that this was a portent of never-ending hardship ,  and that heaven frowned on their deeds
 utendum inclinatione ea Caesar et quae casus obtulerat in sapientiam vertenda ratus circumiri tentoria iubet$$ Drusus ,  thinking that he ought to avail himself of this change in their temper and turn what chance had offered to a wise account ,  ordered the tents to be visited
 accitur centurio Clemens et si alii bonis artibus grati in vulgus$$ Clemens ,  the centurion was summoned with all others who for their good qualities were liked by the common soldiers
 hi vigiliis , stationibus , custodiis portarum se inserunt , spem offerunt , metum intendunt$$ These men made their way among the patrols ,  sentries and guards of the camp-gates ,  suggesting hope or holding out threats
 quo usque filium imperatoris obsidebimus$$ How long will you besiege the emperor's son
 quis certaminum finis$$ What is to be the end of our strifes
 Percennione et Vibuleno sacramentum dicturi sumus$$ Will Percennius and Vibulenus give pay to the soldiers and land to those who have earned their discharge
 Percennius et Vibulenus stipendia militibus , agros emeritis largientur$$ In a word ,  are they ,  instead of the Neros and the Drusi ,  to control the empire of the Roman people
 denique pro Neronibus et Drusis imperium populi Romani capessent$$ Why are we not rather first in our repentance as we were last in the offence
 quin potius , ut novissimi in culpam , ita primi ad paenitentiam sumus$$ Demands made in common are granted slowly
 tarda sunt quae in commune expostulantur$$ a separate favour you may deserve and receive at the same moment
 privatam gratiam statim mereare , statim recipias$$ With minds affected by these words and growing mutually suspicious ,  they divided off the new troops from the old ,  and one legion from another
 commotis per haec mentibus et inter se suspectis , tironem a veterano$$ Then by degrees the instinct of obedience returned
 legionem a legione dissociant$$ They quitted the gates and restored to their places the standards which at the beginning of the mutiny they had grouped into one spot
 Drusus orto die et vocata contione , quamquam rudis dicendi , nobilitate ingenita incusat priora , probat praesentia$$ At daybreak Drusus called them to an assembly ,  and ,  though not a practised speaker ,  yet with natural dignity upbraided them for their past and commended their present behaviour
 negat se terrore et minis vinci$$ He was not ,  he said ,  to be conquered by terror or by threats
 flexos ad modestiam si videat , si supplices audiat , scripturum patri ut placatus legionum preces exciperet$$ Were he to see them inclining to submission and hear the language of entreaty ,  he would write to his father ,  that he might be merciful and receive the legions' petition
 orantibus rursum idem Blaesus et Lucius Aponius , eques Romanus e cohorte Drusi , Iustusque Catonius , primi ordinis centurio , ad Tiberium mittuntur$$ At their prayer ,  Blaesus and Lucius Apronius ,  a Roman knight on Drusus's staff ,  with Justus Catonius ,  a first-rank centurion ,  were again sent to Tiberius
 certatum inde sententiis , cum alii opperiendos legatos atque interim comitate permulcendum militem censerent , alii fortioribus remediis agendum nihil in vulgo modicum terrere ni paveant , ubi pertimuerint inpune contemni$$ Then ensued a conflict of opinion among them ,  some maintaining that it was best to wait the envoys' return and meanwhile humour the soldiers ,  others ,  that stronger measures ought to be used ,  inasmuch as the rabble knows no mean ,  and inspires fear ,  unless they are afraid ,  though when they have once been overawed ,  they can be safely despised
 dum superstitio urgeat , adiciendos ex duce metus sublatis seditionis auctoribus$$ While superstition still swayed them ,  the general should apply terror by removing the leaders of the mutiny
 promptum ad asperiora ingenium Druso erat$$ Drusus's temper was inclined to harsh measures
 vocatos Vibulenum et Percennium interfici iubet$$ He summoned Vibulenus and Percennius and ordered them to be put to death
 tradunt plerique intra tabernaculum ducis obrutos , alii corpora extra vallum abiecta ostentui$$ The common account is that they were buried in the general's tent ,  though according to some their bodies were flung outside the entrenchments for all to see
 Tum ut quisque praecipuus turbator conquisiti , et pars , extra castra palantes , a centurionibus aut praetoriarum cohortium militibus caesi$$ Search was then made for all the chief mutineers Some as they roamed outside the camp were cut down by the centurions or by soldiers of the praetorian cohorts
 quosdam ipsi manipuli documentum fidei tradidere$$ Some even the companies gave up in proof of their loyalty
 auxerat militum curas praematura hiems imbribus continuis adeoque saevis , ut non egredi tentoria , congregari inter se , vix tutari signa possent , quae turbine atque unda raptabantur$$ The men's troubles were increased by an early winter with continuous storms so violent that they could not go beyond their tents or meet together or keep the standards in their places ,  from which they were perpetually tom by hurricane and rain
 durabat et formido caelestis irae , nec frustra adversus impios hebescere sidera , ruere tempestates$$ And there still lingered the dread of the divine wrath nor was it without meaning ,  they thought ,  that ,  hostile to an impious host ,  the stars grew dim and storms burst over them
 non aliud malorum levamentum , quam si linquerent castra infausta temerataque et soluti piaculo suis quisque hibernis redderentur$$ Their only relief from misery was to quit an ill-omened and polluted camp ,  and ,  having purged themselves of their guilt ,  to betake themselves again every one to his winterquarters
 primum octava , dein quinta decuma legio rediere$$ First the eighth ,  then the fifteenth legion returned
 nonanus opperiendas Tiberii epistulas clamitaverat , mox desolatus aliorum discessione imminentem necessitatem sponte praevenit$$ the ninth cried again and again that they ought to wait for the letter from Tiberius ,  but soon finding themselves isolated by the departure of the rest ,  they voluntarily forestalled their inevitable fate
 et Drusus non exspectato legatorum regressu , quia praesentia satis conse derant , in urbem rediit$$ Drusus ,  without awaiting the envoys' return ,  as for the present all was quiet ,  went back to Rome
 Isdem ferme diebus isdem causis Germanicae legiones turbatae , quanto plures tanto violentius , et magna spe fore ut Germanicus Caesar imperium alterius pati nequiret daretque se legionibus vi sua cuncta tracturis$$ About the same time ,  from the same causes ,  the legions of Germany rose in mutiny ,  with a fury proportioned to their greater numbers ,  in the confident hope that Germanicus Caesar would not be able to endure another's supremacy and offer himself to the legions ,  whose strength would carry everything before it
 duo apud ripam Rheni exercitus erant$$ There were two armies on the bank of the Rhine
 cui nomen superiori sub Gaius Silio legato , inferiorem Aulus Caecina curabat$$ that named the upper army had Caius Silius for general
 regimen summae rei penes Germanicum agendo Galliarum censui tum intentum$$ the lower was under the charge of Aulus Caecina
 sed quibus Silius moderabatur , mente ambigua fortunam seditionis alienae speculabantur$$ The supreme direction rested with Germanicus ,  then busily employed in conducting the assessment of Gaul
 inferioris exercitus miles in rabiem prolapsus est , orto ab unetvicesimanis quintanisque initio , et tractis prima quoque ac vicesima legionibus nam isdem aestivis in finibus Vbiorum habebantur per otium aut levia munia$$ The troops under the control of Silius ,  with minds yet in suspense ,  watched the issue of mutiny elsewhere but the soldiers of the lower army fell into a frenzy ,  which had its beginning in the men of the twenty-first and fifth legions ,  and into which the first and twentieth were also drawn
 igitur audito fine Augusti vernacula multitudo , nuper acto in urbe dilectu , lasciviae sueta , laborum intolerans , implere ceterorum rudes animos$$ For they were all quartered in the same summer-camp ,  in the territory of the Ubii ,  enjoying ease or having only light duties
 venisse tempus quo veterani maturam missionem , iuvenes largiora stipendia , cuncti modum miseriarum exposcerent saevitiamque centurionum ulciscerentur non unus haec , ut Pannonicas inter legiones Percennius , nec apud trepidas militum auris , alios validiores exercitus respicientium , sed multa seditionis ora vocesque$$ Accordingly on hearing of the death of Augustus ,  a rabble of city slaves ,  who had been enlisted under a recent levy at Rome ,  habituated to laxity and impatient of hardship ,  filled the ignorant minds of the other soldiers with notions that the time had come when the veteran might demand a timely discharge ,  the young ,  more liberal pay ,  all ,  an end of their miseries ,  and vengeance on the cruelty of centurions
 sua in manu sitam rem Romanam , suis victoriis augeri rem publicam , in suum cognomentum adscisci imperatores$$ It was not one alone who spoke thus ,  as did Percennius among the legions of Pannonia ,  nor was it in the ears of trembling soldiers ,  who looked with apprehension to other and mightier armies ,  but there was sedition in many a face and voice
 Nec legatus obviam ibat$$ Nor did their commander check them
 quippe plurium vaecordia constantiam exemerat$$ Indeed ,  the blind rage of so many had robbed him of his resolution
 repente lymphati destrictis gladiis in centuriones invadunt ea vetustissima militaribus odiis materies et saeviendi principium$$ ,  In a sudden frenzy they rushed with drawn swords on the centurions ,  the immemorial object of the soldiers' resentment and the first cause of savage fury
 prostratos verberibus mulcant , sexageni singulos , ut numerum centurionum adaequarent$$ They threw them to the earth and beat them sorely ,  sixty to one ,  so as to correspond with the number of centurions
 tum convulsos laniatosque et partim exanimos ante vallum aut in amnem Rhenum proiciunt$$ Then tearing them from the ground ,  mangled ,  and some lifeless ,  they flung them outside the entrenchments or into the river Rhine
 Septimius cum perfugisset ad tribunal pedibusque Caecinae advolveretur , eo usque flagitatus est donec ad exitium dederetur$$ One Septimius ,  who fled to the tribunal and was grovelling at Caecina's feet ,  was persistently demanded till he was given up to destruction
 Cassius Chaerea , mox caede Gai Caesaris memoriam apud posteros adeptus , tum adulescens et animi ferox , inter obstantis et armatos ferro viam patefecit$$ Cassius Chaerea ,  who won for himself a memory with posterity by the murder of Caius Caesar ,  being then a youth of high spirit ,  cleared a passage with his sword through the armed and opposing throng
 non tribunus ultra , non castrorum praefectus ius obtinuit$$ Neither tribune nor camp-prefect maintained authority any longer
 vigilias , stationes , et si qua alia praesens usus indixerat , ipsi partiebantur$$ Patrols ,  sentries ,  and whatever else the needs of the time required ,  were distributed by the men themselves
 id militaris animos altius coniectantibus praecipuum indicium magni atque inplacabilis motus , quod neque disiecti nec paucorum instinctu , set pariter ardescerent , pariter silerent , tanta aequalitate et constantia ut regi crederes$$ To those who could guess the temper of soldiers with some penetration ,  the strongest symptom of a wide-spread and intractable commotion ,  was the fact that ,  instead of being divided or instigated by a few persons ,  they were unanimous in their fury and equally unanimous in their composure ,  with so uniform a consistency that one would have thought them to be under command
 Sed Germanicus quanto summae spei propior , tanto impensius pro Tiberio niti Sequanos proximos et Belgarum civitates in verba eius adigit$$ But the nearer Germanicus was to the highest hope ,  the more laboriously did he exert himself for Tiberius ,  and he made the neighbouring Sequani and all the Belgic states swear obedience to him
 dehinc audito legionum tumultu raptim profectus obvias extra castra habuit , deiectis in terram oculis velut paenitentia$$ On hearing of the mutiny in the legions ,  he instantly went to the spot ,  and met them outside the camp ,  eyes fixed on the ground ,  and seemingly repentant
 postquam vallum iniit dissoni questus audiri coepere$$ As soon as he entered the entrenchments ,  confused murmurs became audible
 et quidam prensa manu eius per speciem exosculandi inseruerunt digitos ut vacua dentibus ora contingeret$$ Some men ,  seizing his hand under pretence of kissing it ,  thrust his fingers into their mouths ,  that he might touch their toothless gums
 alii curvata senio membra ostendebant$$ others showed him their limbs bowed with age
 adsistentem contionem , quia permixta videbatur , discedere in manipulos iubet$$ He ordered the throng which stood near him ,  as it seemed a promiscuous gathering ,  to separate itself into its military companies
 sic melius audituros responsum$$ They replied that they would hear better as they were
 vexilla praeferri ut id saltem discerneret cohortis$$ The standards were then to be advanced ,  so that thus at least the cohorts might be distinguished
 tarde obtemperavere$$ The soldiers obeyed reluctantly
 tunc a veneratione Augusti orsus flexit ad victorias triumphosque Tiberii , praecipuis laudibus celebrans quae apud Germanias illis cum legionibus pulcherrima fecisset$$ Then beginning with a reverent mention of Augustus ,  he passed on to the victories and triumphs of Tiberius ,  dwelling with especial praise on his glorious achievements with those legions in Germany
 Italiae inde consensum , Galliarum fidem extollit$$ Next ,  he extolled the unity of Italy ,  the loyalty of Gaul ,  the entire absence of turbulence or strife
 nil usquam turbidum aut discors$$ He was heard in silence or with but a slight murmur
 Vt seditionem attigit , ubi modestia militaris , ubi veteris disciplinae decus , quonam tribunos , quo centuriones exegissent , rogitans , nudant universi corpora , cicatrices ex vulneribus , verberum notas exprobrant$$ As soon as he touched on the mutiny and asked what had become of soldierly obedience ,  of the glory of ancient discipline ,  whither they had driven their tribunes and centurions ,  they all bared their bodies and taunted him with the scars of their wounds and the marks of the lash
 mox indiscretis vocibus pretia vacationum , angustias stipendii , duritiam operum ac propriis nominibus incusant vallum , fossas , pabuli materiae lignorum adgestus , et si qua alia ex necessitate aut adversus otium castrorum quaeruntur$$ And then with confused exclamations they spoke bitterly of the prices of exemptions ,  of their scanty pay ,  of the severity of their tasks ,  with special mention of the entrenchment ,  the fosse ,  the conveyance of fodder ,  building-timber ,  firewood ,  and whatever else had to be procured from necessity ,  or as a check on idleness in the camp
 atrocissimus veteranorum clamor oriebatur , qui tricena aut supra stipendia numerantes , mederetur fessis , neu mortem in isdem laboribus , sed finem tam exercitae militiae neque inopem requiem orabant$$ The fiercest clamour arose from the veteran soldiers ,  who ,  as they counted their thirty campaigns or more ,  implored him to relieve worn-out men ,  and not let them die under the same hardships ,  but have an end of such harassing service ,  and repose without beggary
 fuere etiam qui legatam a divo Augusto pecuniam reposcerent , faustis in Germanicum ominibus$$ Some even claimed the legacy of the Divine Augustus ,  with words of good omen for Germanicus ,  and ,  should he wish for empire ,  they showed themselves abundantly willing
 et si vellet imperium promptos ostentavere$$ Thereupon ,  as though he were contracting the pollution of guilt ,  he leapt impetuously from the tribunal
 tum vero , quasi scelere contaminaretur , praeceps tribunali desiluit$$ The men opposed his departure with their weapons ,  threatening him repeatedly if he would not go back
 opposuerunt abeunti arma , minitantes , ni regrederetur at ille moriturum potius quam fidem exueret clamitans , ferrum a latere diripuit elatumque deferebat in pectus , ni proximi prensam dextram vi attinuissent$$ But Germanicus protesting that he would die rather than cast off his loyalty ,  plucked his sword from his side ,  raised it aloft and was plunging it into his breast ,  when those nearest him seized his hand and held it by force
 extrema et conglobata inter se pars contionis ac , vix credibile dictu , quidam singuli propius incedentes feriret hortabantur$$ The remotest and most densely crowded part of the throng ,  and ,  what almost passes belief ,  some ,  who came close up to him ,  urged him to strike the blow ,  and a soldier ,  by name Calusidius ,  offered him a drawn sword ,  saying that it was sharper than his own
 et miles nomine Calusidius strictum obtulit gladium , addito acutiorem esse$$ Even in their fury ,  this seemed to them a savage act and one of evil precedent ,  and there was a pause during which Caesar's friends hurried him into his tent
 Consultatum ibi de remedio$$ There they took counsel how to heal matters
 etenim nuntiabatur parari legatos qui superiorem exercitum ad causam eandem traherent$$ For news was also brought that the soldiers were preparing the despatch of envoys who were to draw the upper army into their cause
 destinatum excidio Vbiorum oppidum , imbutasque praeda manus in direptionem Galliarum erupturas$$ that the capital of the Ubii was marked out for destruction ,  and that hands with the stain of plunder on them would soon be daring enough for the pillage of Gaul
 augebat metum gnarus Romanae seditionis et , si omitteretur ripa , invasurus hostis$$ The alarm was heightened by the knowledge that the enemy was aware of the Roman mutiny ,  and would certainly attack if the Rhine bank were undefended
 at si auxilia et socii adversum abscedentis legiones armarentur , civile bellum suscipi$$ Yet if the auxiliary troops and allies were to be armed against the retiring legions ,  civil war was in fact begun
 periculosa severitas , flagitiosa largitio$$ Severity would be dangerous
 seu nihil militi sive omnia concedentur in ancipiti res publica$$ profuse liberality would be scandalous Whether all or nothing were conceded to the soldiery ,  the State was equally in jeopardy
 igitur volutatis inter se rationibus placitum ut epistulae nomine principis scriberentur missionem dari vicena stipendia meritis , exauctorari qui sena dena fecissent ac retineri sub vexillo ceterorum inmunes nisi propulsandi hostis , legata quae petiverant exsolvi duplicarique$$ Accordingly ,  having weighed their plans one against each other ,  they decided that a letter should be written in the prince's name ,  to the effect that full discharge was granted to those who had served in twenty campaigns that there was a conditional release for those who had served sixteen ,  and that they were to be retained under a standard with immunity from everything except actually keeping off the enemy
 Interea legati ab senatu regressum iam apud aram Vbiorum Germanicum adeunt$$ Meanwhile envoys from the Senate had an interview with Germanicus ,  who had now returned ,  at the Altar of the Ubii
 duae ibi legiones , prima atque vicesima , veteranique nuper missi sub vexillo hiemabant$$ Two legions ,  the first and twentieth ,  with veterans discharged and serving under a standard ,  were there in winter-quarters
 pavidos et conscientia vaecordes intrat metus venisse patrum iussu qui inrita facerent quae per seditionem expresserant$$ In the bewilderment of terror and conscious guilt they were penetrated by an apprehension that persons had come at the Senate's orders to cancel the concessions they had extorted by mutiny
 utque mos vulgo quamvis falsis reum subdere , Munatium Plancum consulatu functum , principem legationis , auctorem senatus consulti incusant$$ And as it is the way with a mob to fix any charge ,  however groundless ,  on some particular person ,  they reproached Manatius Plancus ,  an ex-consul and the chief envoy ,  with being the author of the Senate's decree
 et nocte concubia vexillum in domo Germanici situm flagitare occipiunt , concursuque ad ianuam facto moliuntur foris , extractum cubili Caesarem tradere vexillum intento mortis metu subigunt$$ At midnight they began to demand the imperial standard kept in Germanicus's quarters ,  and having rushed together to the entrance ,  burst the door ,  dragged Caesar from his bed ,  and forced him by menaces of death to give up the standard
 mox vagi per vias obvios habuere legatos , audita consternatione ad Germanicum tendentis$$ Then roaming through the camp-streets ,  they met the envoys ,  who on hearing of the tumult were hastening to Germanicus
 ingerunt contumelias , caedem parant , Planco maxime , quem dignitas fuga impediverat$$ They loaded them with insults ,  and were on the point of murdering them ,  Plancus especially ,  whose high rank had deterred him from flight
 neque aliud periclitanti subsidium quam castra primae legionis$$ In his peril he found safety only in the camp of the first legion
 illic signa et aquilam amplexus religione sese tutabatur , ac ni aquilifer Calpurnius vim extremam arcuisset , rarum etiam inter hostis , legatus populi Romani Romanis in castris sanguine suo altaria deum commaculavisset$$ There clasping the standards and the eagle ,  he sought to protect himself under their sanctity And had not the eagle-bearer ,  Calpurnius ,  saved him from the worst violence ,  the blood of an envoy of the Roman people ,  an occurrence rare even among our foes ,  would in a Roman camp have stained the altars of the gods
 luce demum , postquam dux et miles et facta noscebantur , ingressus castra Germanicus perduci ad se Plancum imperat recepitque in tribunal$$ At last ,  with the light of day ,  when the general and the soldiers and the whole affair were clearly recognised ,  Germanicus entered the camp ,  ordered Plancus to be conducted to him ,  and received him on the tribunal
 tum fatalem increpans rabiem , neque militum sed deum ira resurgere , cur venerint legati aperit$$ He then upbraided them with their fatal infatuation ,  revived not so much by the anger of the soldiers as by that of heaven ,  and explained the reasons of the envoys' arrival
 ius legationis atque ipsius Planci gravem et immeritum casum , simul quantum dedecoris adierit legio , facunde miseratur , attonitaque magis quam quieta contione legatos praesidio auxiliarium equitum dimittit$$ On the rights of ambassadors ,  on the dreadful and undeserved peril of Plancus ,  and also on the disgrace into which the legion had brought itself ,  he dwelt with the eloquence of pity ,  and while the throng was confounded rather than appeased ,  he dismissed the envoys with an escort of auxiliary cavalry
 Eo in metu arguere Germanicum omnes quod non ad superiorem exercitum pergeret , ubi obsequia et contra rebellis auxilium$$ Amid the alarm all condemned Germanicus for not going to the Upper Army ,  where he might find obedience and help against the rebels
 satis superque missione et pecunia et mollibus consultis peccatum vel si vilis ipsi salus , cur filium parvulum , cur gravidam coniugem inter furentis et omnis humani iuris violatores haberet$$ Enough and more than enough blunders ,  they said ,  had been made by granting discharges and money ,  indeed ,  by conciliatory measures Even if Germanicus held his own life cheap ,  why should he keep a little son and a pregnant wife among madmen who outraged every human right
 illos saltem avo et rei publicae redderet$$ Let these ,  at least ,  be restored safely to their grandsire and to the State
 diu cunctatus aspernantem uxorem , cum se divo Augusto ortam neque degenerem ad pericula testaretur , postremo uterum eius et communem filium multo cum fletu complexus , ut abiret perpulit$$ When his wife spurned the notion ,  protesting that she was a descendant of the Divine Augustus and could face peril with no degenerate spirit ,  he at last embraced her and the son of their love with many tears ,  and after long delay compelled her to depart
 incedebat muliebre et miserabile agmen , profuga ducis uxor , parvulum sinu filium gerens , lamentantes circum amicorum coniuges quae simul trahebantur nec minus tristes qui manebant$$ Slowly moved along a pitiable procession of women ,  a general's fugitive wife with a little son in her bosom ,  her friends' wives weeping round her ,  as with her they were dragging themselves from the camp
 Non florentis Caesaris neque suis in castris , sed velut in urbe victa facies gemitusque ac planctus etiam militum auris oraque advertere$$ There was no appearance of the triumphant general about Germanicus ,  and he seemed to be in a conquered city rather than in his own camp ,  while groans and wailings attracted the ears and looks even of the soldiers
 progrediuntur contuberniis$$ They came out of their tents ,  asking what was that mournful sound
 quis ille flebilis sonus$$ What meant the sad sight
 quod tam triste feminas inlustris , non centurionem ad tutelam , non militem , nihil imperatoriae uxoris aut comitatus soliti$$ Here were ladies of rank ,  not a centurion to escort them ,  not a soldier ,  no sign of a prince's wife ,  none of the usual retinue
 pergere ad Treviros et externae fidei$$ Could they be going to the Treveri ,  to be subjects of the foreigner
 pudor inde et miseratio et patris Agrippae , Augusti avi memoria , socer Drusus , ipsa insigni fecunditate , praeclara pudicitia$$ Then they felt shame and pity ,  and remembered his father Agrippa ,  her grandfather Augustus ,  her father-in-law Drusus ,  her own glory as a mother of children ,  her noble purity
 iam infans in castris genitus , in contubernio legionum eductus , quem militari vocabulo Caligulam appellabant , quia plerumque ad concilianda vulgi studia eo tegmine pedum induebatur$$ And there was her little child too ,  born in the camp ,  brought up amid the tents of the legions ,  whom they used to call in soldiers' fashion ,  Caligula ,  because he often wore the shoe so called ,  to win the men's goodwill
 sed nihil aeque flexit quam invidia in Treviros$$ But nothing moved them so much as jealousy towards the Treveri
 orant obsistunt , rediret maneret , pars Agrippinae occursantes , plurimi ad Germanicum regressi$$ They entreated ,  stopped the way ,  that Agrippina might return and remain ,  some running to meet her ,  while most of them went back to Germanicus
 isque ut erat recens dolore et ira apud circumfusos ita coepit$$ He ,  with a grief and anger that were yet fresh ,  thus began to address the throng around him -
 Non mihi uxor aut filius patre et re publica cariores sunt , sed illum quidem sua maiestas , imperium Romanum ceteri exercitus defendent$$ Neither wife nor son are dearer to me than my father and the State But he will surely have the protection of his own majesty ,  the empire of Rome that of our other armies
 coniugem et liberos meos , quos pro gloria vestra libens ad exitium offerrem , nunc procul a furentibus summoveo , ut quidquid istud sceleris imminet , meo tantum sanguine pietur , neve occisus Augusti pronepos , interfecta Tiberii nurus nocentiores vos faciant$$ My wife and children whom ,  were it a question of your glory ,  I would willingly expose to destruction ,  I now remove to a distance from your fury ,  so that whatever wickedness is thereby threatened ,  may be expiated by my blood only ,  and that you may not be made more guilty by the slaughter of a great-grandson of Augustus ,  and the murder of a daughter-in-law of Tiberius
 quid enim per hos dies inausum intemeratumve vobis$$ For what have you not dared ,  what have you not profaned during these days
 quod nomen huic coetui dabo$$ What name shall I give to this gathering
 militesne appellem , qui filium imperatoris vestri vallo et armis circumsedistis$$ Am I to call you soldiers ,  you who have beset with entrenchments and arms your general's son ,  or citizens ,  when you have trampled under foot the authority of the Senate
 an civis , quibus tam proiecta senatus auctoritas$$ Even the rights of public enemies ,  the sacred character of the ambassador ,  and the law of nations have been violated by you
 hostium quoque ius et sacra legationis et fas gentium rupistis$$ The Divine Julius once quelled an army's mutiny with a single word by calling those who were renouncing their military obedience 'citizens
 divus Iulius seditionem exercitus verbo uno compescuit , Quirites vocando qui sacramentum eius detrectabant$$' The Divine Augustus cowed the legions who had fought at Actium with one look of his face
 divus Augustus vultu et aspectu Actiacas legiones exterruit$$ Though I am not yet what they were ,  still ,  descended as I am from them ,  it would be a strange and unworthy thing should I be spurned by the soldiery of Spain or Syria
 nos ut nondum eosdem , ita ex illis ortos si Hispaniae Syriaeve miles aspernaretur , tamen mirum et indignum erat$$ First and twentieth legions ,  you who received your standards from Tiberius ,  you ,  men of the twentieth who have shared with me so many battles and have been enriched with so many rewards ,  is not this a fine gratitude with which you are repaying your general
 primane et vicesima legiones , illa signis a Tiberio acceptis , tu tot proeliorum socia , tot praemiis aucta , egregiam duci vestro gratiam refertis$$ Are these the tidings which I shall have to carry to my father when he hears only joyful intelligence from our other provinces ,  that his own recruits ,  his own veterans are not satisfied with discharge or pay
 hunc ego nuntium patri laeta omnia aliis e provinciis audienti feram$$ that here only centurions are murdered ,  tribunes driven away ,  envoys imprisoned ,  camps and rivers stained with blood ,  while I am myself dragging on a precarious existence amid those who hate me
 Cur enim primo contionis die ferrum illud , quod pectori meo infigere parabam , detraxistis , o inprovidi amici$$ Why ,  on the first day of our meeting ,  why did you ,  my friends ,  wrest from me ,  in your blindness ,  the steel which I was preparing to plunge into my breast
 melius et amantius ille qui gladium offerebat$$ Better and more loving was the act of the man who offered me the sword
 cecidissem certe nondum tot flagitiorum exercitu meo conscius legissetis ducem , qui meam quidem mortem inpunitam sineret , Vari tamen et trium legionum ulcisceretur$$ At any rate I should have perished before I was as yet conscious of all the disgraces of my army ,  while you would have chosen a general who though he might allow my death to pass unpunished would avenge the death of Varus and his three legions
 neque enim di sinant ut Belgarum quamquam offerentium decus istud et claritudo sit subvenisse Romano nomini , compressisse Germaniae populos$$ Never indeed may heaven suffer the Belgae ,  though they proffer their aid ,  to have the glory and honour of having rescued the name of Rome and quelled the tribes of Germany
 tua , dive Auguste , caelo recepta mens , tua , pater Druse , imago , tui memoria isdem istis cum militibus , quos iam pudor et gloria intrat , eluant hanc maculam irasque civilis in exitium hostibus vertant$$ It is thy spirit ,  Divine Augustus ,  now received into heaven ,  thine image ,  father Drusus ,  and the remembrance of thee ,  which ,  with these same soldiers who are now stimulated by shame and ambition ,  should wipe out this blot and turn the wrath of civil strife to the destruction of the foe
 vos quoque , quorum alia nunc ora , alia pectora contueor , si legatos senatui , obsequium imperatori , si mihi coniugem et filium redditis , discedite a contactu ac dividite turbidos$$ You too ,  in whose faces and in whose hearts I perceive a change ,  if only you restore to the Senate their envoys ,  to the emperor his due allegiance ,  to myself my wife and son ,  do you stand aloof from pollution and separate the mutinous from among you
 id stabile ad paenitentiam , id fidei vinculum erit$$ This will be a pledge of your repentance ,  a guarantee of your loyalty
 Supplices ad haec et vera exprobrari fatentes orabant puniret noxios , ignosceret lapsis et duceret in hostem$$ Thereupon ,  as suppliants confessing that his reproaches were true ,  they implored him to punish the guilty ,  pardon those who had erred ,  and lead them against the enemy

 venturum filium$$ His son ,  he said ,  would come ,  and the rest they might settle themselves
 cetera ipsi exsequerentur discurrunt mutati et seditiosissimum quemque vinctos trahunt ad legatum legionis primae Gaius Caetronium , qui iudicium et poenas de singulis in hunc modum exercuit$$ Away they hurried hither and thither ,  altered men ,  and dragged the chief mutineers in chains to Caius Caetronius commander of the first legion ,  who tried and punished them one by one in the following fashion
 stabant pro contione legiones destrictis gladiis$$ In front of the throng stood the legions with drawn swords
 reus in suggestu per tribunum ostendebatur$$ Each accused man was on a raised platform and was pointed out by a tribune

 et gaudebat caedibus miles tamquam semet absolveret$$ The soldiers gloated over the bloodshed as though it gave them absolution
 nec Caesar arcebat , quando nullo ipsius iussu penes eosdem saevitia facti et invidia erat$$ Nor did Caesar check them ,  seeing that without any order from himself the same men were responsible for all the cruelty and all the odium of the deed
 secuti exemplum veterani haud multo post in Raetiam mittuntur , specie defendendae provinciae ob imminentis Suebos ceterum ut avellerentur castris trucibus adhuc non minus asperitate remedii quam sceleris memoria$$ The example was followed by the veterans ,  who were soon afterwards sent into Raetia ,  nominally to defend the province against a threatened invasion of the Suevi but really that they might tear themselves from a camp stamped with the horror of a dreadful remedy no less than with the memory of guilt
 centurionatum inde egit$$ Then the general revised the list of centurions
 citatus ab imperatore nomen , ordinem , patriam , numerum stipendiorum , quae strenue in proeliis fecisset , et cui erant , dona militaria edebat$$ Each ,  at his summons ,  stated his name ,  his rank ,  his birthplace ,  the number of his campaigns ,  what brave deeds he had done in battle ,  his military rewards ,  if any

 ubi avaritiam aut crudelitatem consensu obiectavissent , solvebatur militia$$ where they unanimously charged him with rapacity or cruelty ,  he was dismissed the service
 Sic compositis praesentibus haud minor moles supererat ob ferociam quintae et unetvicesimae legionum , sexagesimum apud lapidem (loco Vetera nomen est) hibernantium$$ Quiet being thus restored for the present ,  a no less formidable difficulty remained through the turbulence of the fifth and twenty-first legions ,  who were in winter quarters sixty miles away at Old Camp ,  as the place was called
 nam primi seditionem coeptaverant atrocisslmum quodque facinus horum manibus patratum$$ These ,  in fact ,  had been the first to begin the mutiny ,  and the most atrocious deeds had been committed by their hands
 nec poena commilitonum exterriti nec paenitentia conversi iras retinebant$$ Unawed by the punishment of their comrades ,  and unmoved by their contrition ,  they still retained their resentment
 igitur Caesar arma classem socios demittere Rheno parat , si imperium detrectetur , bello certaturus$$ Caesar accordingly proposed to send an armed fleet with some of our allies down the Rhine ,  resolved to make war on them should they reject his authority
 At Romae nondum cognito qui fuisset exitus in Illyrico , et legionum Germanicarum motu audito , trepida civitas incusare Tiberium quod , dum patres et plebem , invalida et inermia , cunctatione ficta ludificetur , dissideat interim miles neque duorum adulescentium nondum adulta auctoritate comprimi queat$$ At Rome ,  meanwhile ,  when the result of affairs in Illyrium was not yet known ,  and men had heard of the commotion among the German legions ,  the citizens in alarm reproached Tiberius for the hypocritical irresolution with which he was befooling the senate and the people ,  feeble and disarmed as they were ,  while the soldiery were all the time in revolt ,  and could not be quelled by the yet imperfectly-matured authority of two striplings
 ire ipsum et opponere maiestatem imperatoriam debuisse cessuris ubi principem longa experientia eundemque severitatis et munificentiae summum vidissent$$ He ought to have gone himself and confronted with his imperial majesty those who would have soon yielded ,  when they once saw a sovereign of long experience ,  who was the supreme dispenser of rigour or of bounty
 an Augustum fessa aetate totiens in Germanias commeare potuisse Tiberium vigentem annis sedere in senatu , verba patrum cavillantem$$ Could Augustus ,  with the feebleness of age on him ,  so often visit Germany ,  and is Tiberius ,  in the vigour of life ,  to sit in the Senate and criticise its members' words

 multa quippe et diversa angebant$$ Indeed ,  many conflicting thoughts troubled him

 Sed Germanicus cedentem in avia Arminium secutus , ubi primum copia fuit , evehi equites campumque quem hostis insederat eripi iubet$$ Germanicus ,  however ,  pursued Arminius as he fell back into trackless wilds ,  and as soon as he had the opportunity ,  ordered his cavalry to sally forth and scour the plains occupied by the enemy

 circum silvae paulatim adclives , quas tum Arminius inplevit , compendiis viarum et cito agmine onustum sarcinis armisque militem cum antevenisset$$ Around were woods on a gradual slope ,  which Arminius now completely occupied ,  as soon as by a short route and quick march he had outstripped troops heavily laden with baggage and arms

 et cuncta pariter Romanis adversa , locus uligine profunda , idem ad gradum instabilis , procedentibus lubricus , corpora gravia loricis$$ Everything alike was unfavourable to the Romans ,  the place with its deep swamps ,  insecure to the foot and slippery as one advanced ,  limbs burdened with coats of mail ,  and the impossibility of aiming their javelins amid the water

 contra Cheruscis sueta apud paludes proelia , procera membra , hastae ingentes ad vulnera facienda quamvis procul$$ they had huge frames ,  and lances long enough to inflict wounds even at a distance

 quadragesimum id stipendium Caecina parendi aut imperitandi habebat , secundarum ambiguarumque rerum sciens eoque interritus$$ This was Caecina's fortieth campaign as a subordinate or a commander ,  and ,  with such experience of success and peril ,  he was perfectly fearless
 igitur futura volvens non aliud repperit quam ut hostem silvis coerceret , donec saucii quantumque gravioris agminis anteirent$$ As he thought over future possibilities ,  he could devise no plan but to keep the enemy within the woods ,  till the wounded and the more encumbered troops were in advance
 nam medio montium et paludum porrigebatur planities , quae tenuem aciem pateretur$$ For between the hills and the swamps there stretched a plain which would admit of an extended line
 deliguntur legiones quinta dextro lateri , unetvicesima in laevum , primani ducendum ad agmen , vicesimanus adversum secuturos$$ The legions had their assigned places ,  the fifth on the right wing ,  the twenty-first on the left ,  the men of the first to lead the van ,  the twentieth to repel pursuers
 Nox per diversa inquies , cum barbari festis epulis , laeto cantu aut truci sonore subiecta vallium ac resultantis saltus complerent , apud Romanos invalidi ignes , interruptae voces , atque ipsi passim adiacerent vallo , oberrarent tentoriis , insomnes magis quam pervigiles$$ It was a restless night for different reasons ,  the barbarians in their festivity filling the valleys under the hills and the echoing glens with merry song or savage shouts ,  while in the Roman camp were flickering fires ,  broken exclamations ,  and the men lay scattered along the intrenchments or wandered from tent to tent ,  wakeful rather than watchful
 ducemque terruit dira quies$$ A ghastly dream appalled the general
 nam Quintilium Varum sanguine oblitum et paludibus emersum cernere et audire visus est velut vocantem , non tamen obsecutus et manum intendentis reppulisse coepta luce missae in latera legiones , metu an contumacia , locum deseruere , capto propere campo umentia ultra$$ He seemed to see Quintilius Varus ,  covered with blood ,  rising out of the swamps ,  and to hear him ,  as it were ,  calling to him ,  but he did not ,  as he imagined ,  obey the call he even repelled his hand ,  as he stretched it over him At daybreak the legions ,  posted on the wings ,  from panic or perversity ,  deserted their position and hastily occupied a plain beyond the morass
 neque tamen Arminius quamquam libero incursu statim prorupit$$ Yet Arminius ,  though free to attack ,  did not at the moment rush out on them
 sed ut haesere caeno fossisque impedimenta , turbati circum milites , incertus signorum ordo , utque tali in tempore sibi quisque properus et lentae adversum imperia aures , inrumpere Germanos iubet , clamitans en Varus eodemque iterum fato vinctae legiones! simul haec et cum delectis scindit agmen equisque maxime vulnera ingerit$$ But when the baggage was clogged in the mud and in the fosses ,  the soldiers around it in disorder ,  the array of the standards in confusion ,  every one in selfish haste and all ears deaf to the word of command he ordered the Germans to charge ,  exclaiming again and again ,  Behold a Varus and legions once more entangled in Varus's fate As he spoke ,  he cut through the column with some picked men ,  inflicting wounds chiefly on the horses
 illi sanguine suo et lubrico paludum lapsantes excussis rectoribus disicere obvios , proterere iacentis$$ Staggering in their blood on the slippery marsh ,  they shook off their riders ,  driving hither and thither all in their way ,  and trampling on the fallen
 plurimus circa aquilas labor , quae neque ferri adversum ingruentia tela neque figi limosa humo poterant$$ The struggle was hottest round the eagles ,  which could neither be carried in the face of the storm of missiles ,  nor planted in the miry soil
 Caecina dum sustentat aciem , suffosso equo delapsus circumveniebatur , ni prima legio sese opposuisset$$ Caecina ,  while he was keeping up the battle ,  fell from his horse ,  which was pierced under him ,  and was being hemmed in ,  when the first legion threw itself in the way
 iuvit hostium aviditas , omissa caede praedam sectantium , enisaeque legiones vesperascente die in aperta et solida$$ The greed of the foe helped him ,  for they left the slaughter to secure the spoil ,  and the legions ,  towards evening ,  struggled on to open and firm ground
 neque is miseriarum finis$$ Nor did this end their miseries
 struendum vallum , petendus agger , amissa magna ex parte per quae egeritur humus aut exciditur caespes$$ Entrenchments had to be thrown up ,  materials sought for earthworks ,  while the army had lost to a great extent their implements for digging earth and cutting turf
 non tentoria manipulis , non fomenta sauciis$$ There were no tents for the rank and file ,  no comforts for the wounded
 infectos caeno aut cruore cibos dividentes funestas tenebras et tot hominum milibus unum iam reliquum diem lamentabantur$$ As they shared their food ,  soiled by mire or blood ,  they bewailed the darkness with its awful omen ,  and the one day which yet remained to so many thousand men
 Forte equus abruptis vinculis vagus et clamore territus quosdam occurrentium obturbavit$$ It chanced that a horse ,  which had broken its halter and wandered wildly in fright at the uproar ,  overthrew some men against whom it dashed
 tanta inde consternatio inrupisse Germanos credentium ut cuncti ruerent ad portas , quarum decumana maxime petebatur , aversa hosti et fugientibus tutior$$ Thence arose such a panic ,  from the belief that the Germans had burst into the camp ,  that all rushed to the gates Of these the decuman gate was the point chiefly sought ,  as it was furthest from the enemy and safer for flight
 Caecina comperto vanam esse formidinem , cum tamen neque auctoritate neque precibus , ne manu quidem obsistere aut retinere militem quiret , proiectus in limine portae miseratione demum , quia per corpus legati eundum erat , clausit viam$$ Caecina ,  having ascertained that the alarm was groundless ,  yet being unable to stop or stay the soldiers by authority or entreaties or even by force ,  threw himself to the earth in the gateway ,  and at last by an appeal to their pity ,  as they would have had to pass over the body of their commander ,  closed the way
 simul tribuni et centuriones falsum pavorem esse docuerunt$$ At the same moment the tribunes and the centurions convinced them that it was a false alarm
 Tunc contractos in principia iussosque dicta cum silentio accipere temporis ac necessitatis monet$$ Having then assembled them at his headquarters ,  and ordered them to hear his words in silence ,  he reminded them of the urgency of the crisis
 unam in armis salutem , sed ea consilio temperanda manendumque intra vallum , donec expugnandi hostis spe propius succederent$$ Their safety ,  he said ,  lay in their arms ,  which they must ,  however ,  use with discretion ,  and they must remain within the entrenchments ,  till the enemy approached closer ,  in the hope of storming them
 mox undique erumpendum$$ then ,  there must be a general sortie
 illa eruptione ad Rhenum perveniri$$ by that sortie the Rhine might be reached
 quod si fugerent , pluris silvas , profundas magis paludes , saevitiam hostium superesse$$ Whereas if they fled ,  more forests ,  deeper swamps ,  and a savage foe awaited them but if they were victorious ,  glory and renown would be theirs
 at victoribus decus gloriam quae domi cara , quae in castris honesta , memorat$$ He dwelt on all that was dear to them at home ,  all that testified to their honour in the camp ,  without any allusion to disaster
 reticuit de adversis equos dehinc , orsus a suis , legatorum tribunorumque nulla ambitione fortissimo cuique bellatori tradit , ut hi , mox pedes in hostem invaderent$$ Next he handed over the horses ,  beginning with his own ,  of the officers and tribunes ,  to the bravest fighters in the army ,  quite impartially ,  that these first ,  and then the infantry ,  might charge the enemy
 Haud minus inquies Cermanus spe , cupidine et diversis ducum sententiis agebat , Arminio sinerent egredi egressosque rursum per umida et inpedita circumvenirent suadente , atrociora Inguiomero et laeta barbaris , ut vallum armis ambirent$$ There was as much restlessness in the German host with its hopes ,  its eager longings ,  and the conflicting opinions of its chiefs Arminius advised that they should allow the Romans to quit their position ,  and ,  when they had quitted it ,  again surprise them in swampy and intricate ground
 promptam expugnationem , plures captivos , incorruptam praedam fore igitur orta die proruunt fossas , iniciunt cratis , summa valli prensant , raro super milite et quasi ob metum defixo$$ Inguiomerus ,  with fiercer counsels ,  heartily welcome to barbarians ,  was for beleaguering the entrenchment in armed array ,  as to storm them would ,  he said ,  be easy ,  and there would be more prisoners and the booty unspoilt
 postquam haesere munimentis , datur cohortibus signum cornuaque ac tubae concinuere$$ So at daybreak they trampled in the fosses ,  flung hurdles into them ,  seized the upper part of the breastwork ,  where the troops were thinly distributed and seemingly paralysed by fear
 exim clamore et impetu tergis Germanorum circumfunduntur , exprobrantes non hic silvas nec paludes , sed aequis locis aequos deos$$ When they were fairly within the fortifications ,  the signal was given to the cohorts ,  and the horns and trumpets sounded
 hosti facile excidium et paucos ac semermos cogitanti sonus tubarum , fulgor armorum , quanto inopina tanto maiora offunduntur , cadebantque , ut rebus secundis avidi , ita adversis incauti Arminius integer , Inguiomerus post grave vulnus pugnam deseruere vulgus trucidatum est , donec ira et dies permansit$$ Instantly ,  with a shout and sudden rush ,  our men threw themselves on the German rear ,  with taunts ,  that here were no woods or swamps ,  but that they were on equal ground ,  with equal chances The sound of trumpets ,  the gleam of arms ,  which were so unexpected ,  burst with all the greater effect on the enemy ,  thinking only ,  as they were ,  of the easy destruction of a few half-armed men ,  and they were struck down ,  as unprepared for a reverse as they had been elated by success
 nocte demum reversae legiones , quamvis plus vulnerum , eadem ciborum egestas fatigaret , vim sanitatem copias , cuncta in victoria habuere$$ Arminius and Inguiomerus fled from the battle ,  the first unhurt ,  the other severely wounded Their followers were slaughtered ,  as long as our fury and the light of day lasted
 Penaserat interim circumventi exercitus fama et infesto Germanorum agmine Gallias peti , ac ni Agrippina inpositum Rheno pontem solvi prohibuisset , erant qui id fiagitium formidine auderent$$ Meanwhile a rumour had spread that our army was cut off ,  and that a furious German host was marching on Gaul And had not Agrippina prevented the bridge over the Rhine from being destroyed ,  some in their cowardice would have dared that base act
 sed femina ingens animi munia ducis per eos dies induit , militibusque , ut quis inops aut saucius , vestem et fomenta dilargita est$$ A woman of heroic spirit ,  she assumed during those days the duties of a general ,  and distributed clothes or medicine among the soldiers ,  as they were destitute or wounded

 id Tiberii animum altius penetravit$$ This made a deep impression on the mind of Tiberius
 non enim simplicis eas curas , nec adversus externos studia militum quaeri$$ Such zeal ,  he thought ,  could not be guileless
 nihil relictum imperatoribus , ubi femina manipulos intervisat , signa adeat , largitionem temptet , tamquam parum ambitiose filium ducis gregali habitu circumferat Caesaremque Caligulam appellari velit$$ it was not against a foreign foe that she was thus courting the soldiers Generals had nothing left them when a woman went among the companies ,  attended the standards ,  ventured on bribery ,  as though it showed but slight ambition to parade her son in a common soldier's uniform ,  and wish him to be called Caesar Caligula

 accendebat haec onerabatque Seianus , peritia morum Tiberii odia in longum iaciens , quae reconderet auctaque promeret$$ All this was inflamed and aggravated by Sejanus ,  who ,  with his thorough comprehension of the character of Tiberius ,  sowed for a distant future hatreds which the emperor might treasure up and might exhibit when fully matured
 Iam Stertinius , ad accipiendum in deditionem Segimerum fratrem Segestis praemissus , ipsum et filium eius in civitatem Vbiorum perduxerat$$ By this time Stertinius ,  who had been despatched to receive the surrender of Segimerus ,  brother of Segestes ,  had conducted the chief ,  together with his son ,  to the canton of the Ubii
 data utrique venia , facile Segimero , cunctantius filio , quia Quintilii Vari corpus inlusisse dicebatur$$ Both were pardoned ,  Segimerus readily ,  the son with some hesitation ,  because it was said that he had insulted the corpse of Quintilius Varus

 non tamen ideo faciebat fidem civilis animi nam legem maiestatis reduxerat , cui nomen apud veteres idem , sed alia in iudicium veniebant , si quis proditione exercitum aut plebem seditionibus , denique male gesta re publica maiestatem populi Romani minuisset$$ But he did not thereby create a belief in his patriotism ,  for he had revived the law of treason ,  the name of which indeed was known in ancient times ,  though other matters came under its jurisdiction ,  such as the betrayal of an army ,  or seditious stirring up of the people ,  or ,  in short ,  any corrupt act by which a man had impaired the majesty of the people of Rome
 facta arguebantur , dicta inpune erant$$ Deeds only were liable to accusation
 primus Augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis specie legis eius tractavit , commotus Cassii Severi libidine , qua viros feminasque inlustris procacibus scriptis diffamaverat$$ words went unpunished It was Augustus who first ,  under colour of this law ,  applied legal inquiry to libellous writings provoked ,  as he had been ,  by the licentious freedom with which Cassius Severus had defamed men and women of distinction in his insulting satires
 mox Tiberius , consultante Pompeio Macro praetore an iudicia maiestatis redderentur , exercendas leges esse re spondit$$ Soon afterwards ,  Tiberius ,  when consulted by Pompeius Macer ,  the praetor ,  as to whether prosecutions for treason should be revived ,  replied that the laws must be enforced

 qui formam vitae iniit , quam postea celebrem miseriae temporum et audaciae hominum fecerunt$$ Crispinus then entered on a line of life afterwards rendered notorious by the miseries of the age and men's shamelessness
 nam egens , ignotus , inquies , dum occultis libellis saevitiae principis adrepit , mox clarissimo cuique periculum facessit , potentiam apud unum , odium apud omnis adeptus dedit exemplum , quod secuti ex pauperibus divites , ex contemptis metuendi perniciem aliis ac postremum sibi invenere$$ Needy ,  obscure ,  and restless ,  he wormed himself by stealthy informations into the confidence of a vindictive prince ,  and soon imperilled all the most distinguished citizens and having thus gained influence with one ,  hatred from all besides ,  he left an example in following which beggars became wealthy ,  the insignificant ,  formidable ,  and brought ruin first on others ,  finally on themselves
 sed Marcellum insimulabat sinistros de Tiberio sermones habuisse , inevitabile crimen , cum ex moribus principis foedissima quaeque deligeret accusator obiectaretque reo$$ He alleged against Marcellus that he had made some disrespectful remarks about Tiberius ,  a charge not to be evaded ,  inasmuch as the accuser selected the worst features of the emperor's character and grounded his case on them
 nam quia vera erant , etiam dicta credebantur$$ The things were true ,  and so were believed to have been said
 addidit Hispo statuam Marcelli altius quam Caesarum sitam , et alia in statua amputato capite Augusti effigiem Tiberii inditam$$ Hispo added that Marcellus had placed his own statue above those of the Caesars ,  and had set the bust of Tiberius on another statue from which he had struck off the head of Augustus
 ad quod exarsit adeo , ut rupta taciturnitate proclamaret se quoque in ea causa laturum sententiam palam et iuratum , quo ceteris eadem necessitas fieret$$ At this the emperor's wrath blazed forth ,  and ,  breaking through his habitual silence ,  he exclaimed that in such a case he would himself too give his vote openly on oath ,  that the rest might be under the same obligation

 permotus his , quantoque incautius efrerverat , paenitentia patiens tulit absolvi reum criminibus maiestatis$$ Tiberius was deeply moved ,  and repenting of the outburst ,  all the more because of its thoughtlessness ,  he quietly allowed the accused to be acquitted of the charges of treason

 Templum ut in colonia Tarraconensi strueretur Augusto petentibus Hispanis permissum , datumque in omnis provincias exemplum$$ A request from the Spaniards that they might erect a temple to Augustus in the colony of Tarraco was granted ,  and a precedent thus given for all the provinces
 centesimam rerum venalium post bella civilia institutam deprecante populo edixit Tiberius militare aerarium eo subsidio niti simul imparem oneri rem publicam , nisi vicesimo militiae anno veterani dimitterentur ita proximae seditionis male consulta , quibus sedecim stipendiorum finem expresserant , abolita in posterum$$ When the people of Rome asked for a remission of the one per cent tax on all saleable commodities ,  Tiberius declared by edict that the military exchequer depended on that branch of revenue ,  and ,  further ,  that the State was unequal to the burden ,  unless the twentieth year of service were to be that of the veteran's discharge Thus the ill-advised results of the late mutiny ,  by which a limit of sixteen campaigns had been extorted ,  were cancelled for the future
 Actum deinde in senatu ab Arruntio et Ateio an ob moderandas Tiberis exundationes verterentur flumina et lacus , per quos augescit$$ A question was then raised in the Senate by Arruntius and Ateius whether ,  in order to restrain the inundations of the Tiber ,  the rivers and lakes which swell its waters should be diverted from their courses
 auditaeque municipiorum et coloniarum legationes , orantibus Florentinis ne Clanis solito alveo demotus in amnem Arnum transferretur idque ipsis perniciem adferret$$ A hearing was given to embassies from the municipal towns and colonies ,  and the people of Florentia begged that the Clanis might not be turned out of its channel and made to flow into the Arnus ,  as that would bring ruin on themselves
 congruentia his Interamnates disseruere$$ Similar arguments were used by the inhabitants of Interamna
 pessum ituros fecundissimos Italiae campos , si amnis Nar (id enim parabatur) in rivos diductus supersta gnavisset$$ The most fruitful plains of Italy ,  they said ,  would be destroyed if the river Nar (for this was the plan proposed) were to be divided into several streams and overflow the country
 nec Reatini silebant , Velinum lacum , qua in Narem effunditur , obstrui recusantes , quippe in adiacentia erupturum$$ Nor did the people of Reate remain silent They remonstrated against the closing up of the Veline lake ,  where it empties itself into the Nar ,  as it would burst in a flood on the entire neighbourhood
 optume rebus mortalium consuluisse naturam , quae sua ora fluminibus , suos cursus utque originem , ita finis dederit$$ Nature had admirably provided for human interests in having assigned to rivers their mouths ,  their channels ,  and their limits ,  as well as their sources
 spectandas etiam religiones sociorum , qui sacra et lucos et aras patriis amnibus dicaverint$$ Regard ,  too ,  must be paid to the different religions of the allies ,  who had dedicated sacred rites ,  groves ,  and altars to the rivers of their country
 quin ipsum Tiberim nolle prorsus accolis fluviis orbatum minore gloria fluere$$ Tiber himself would be altogether unwilling to be deprived of his neighbour streams and to flow with less glory
 seu preces coloniarum seu difficultas operum sive superstitio valuit , ut in sententiam Pisonis concederetur , qui nil mutandum censuerat$$ Either the entreaties of the colonies ,  or the difficulty of the work or superstitious motives prevailed ,  and they yielded to Piso's opinion ,  who declared himself against any change
 De comitiis consularibus , quae tum primum illo principe ac deinceps fuere , vix quicquam firmare ausim adeo diversa non modo apud auctores , sed in ipsius orationibus reperiuntur$$ I can hardly venture on any positive statement about the consular elections ,  now held for the first time under this emperor ,  or ,  indeed ,  subsequently ,  so conflicting are the accounts we find not only in historians but in Tiberius' own speeches

 aliquando ea quoque significatione sub tracta candidatos hortatus ne ambitu comitia turbarent , suam ad id curam pollicitus est$$ Occasionally even these hints were withheld ,  and ,  after urging them not to disturb the elections by canvassing ,  he would promise his own help towards the result
 plerumque eos tantum apud se professos disseruit , quorum nomina consulibus edidisset posse et alios profiteri , si gratiae aut meritis confiderent$$ Generally he declared that only those had offered themselves to him as candidates whose names he had given to the consuls ,  and that others might offer themselves if they had confidence in their influence or merit
 speciosa verbis , re inania aut subdola , quantoque maiore libertatis imagine tegebantur , tanto eruptura ad infensius servitium$$ A plausible profession this in words ,  but really unmeaning and delusive ,  and the greater the disguise of freedom which marked it ,  the more cruel the enslavement into which it was soon to plunge us

 is fuit Vonones , obses Augusto datus a Phraate$$ This was Vonones ,  who had been given as an hostage to Augustus by Phraates

 Post finem Phraatis et sequentium regum ob internas caedis venere in urbem legati a primoribus Parthis , qui Vononem vetustissimum liberorum eius accirent$$ After the death of Phraates and the succeeding kings in the bloodshed of civil wars ,  there came to Rome envoys from the chief men of Parthia ,  in quest of Vonones ,  his eldest son

 ubi illam gloriam trucidantium Crassum , exturbantium Antonium , si mancipium Caesaris , tot per annos servitutem perpessum , Parthis imperitet$$ Where ,  they asked ,  was the glory of the men who slew Crassus ,  who drove out Antonius ,  if Caesar's drudge ,  after an endurance of so many years' slavery ,  were to rule over Parthians
 accendebat dedignantis et ipse diversus a maiorum institutis , raro venatu , segni equorum cura quotiens per urbes incederet , lecticae gestamine fastuque erga patrias epulas$$ Vonones himself too further provoked their disdain ,  by his contrast with their ancestral manners ,  by his rare indulgence in the chase ,  by his feeble interest in horses ,  by the litter in which he was carried whenever he made a progress through their cities ,  and by his contemptuous dislike of their national festivities
 inridebantur et Graeci comites ac vilissima utensilium anulo clausa$$ They also ridiculed his Greek attendants and his keeping under seal the commonest household articles

 insula Batavorum in quam convenirent praedicta , ob facilis adpulsus accipiendisque copiis et transmittendum ad bellum opportuna$$ The island of the Batavi was the appointed rendezvous ,  because of its easy landing-places ,  and its convenience for receiving the army and carrying the war across the river
 nam Rhenus uno alveo continuus aut modicas insulas circumveniens apud principium agri Batavi velut in duos amnis dividitur , servatque nomen et violentiam cursus , qua Germaniam praevehitur , donec Oceano misceatur$$ For the Rhine after flowing continuously in a single channel or encircling merely insignificant islands ,  divides itself ,  so to say ,  where the Batavian territory begins ,  into two rivers ,  retaining its name and the rapidity of its course in the stream which washes Germany ,  till it mingles with the ocean

 classis Amisiae ore relicta laevo amne , erratumque in eo quod non subvexit aut transposuit militem dextras in terras iturum$$ His fleet remained there on the left bank of the stream ,  and it was a blunder that he did not have it brought up the river
 ita plures dies efficiendis pontibus absumpti et eques quidem ac legiones prima aestuaria , nondum adcrescente unda , intrepidi transiere$$ He disembarked the troops ,  which were to be marched to the country on the right ,  and thus several days were wasted in the construction of bridges

 Nec minor Germanis animus , sed genere pugnae et armorum superabantur , cum ingens multitudo artis locis praelongas hastas non protenderet , non colligeret , neque adsultibus et velocitate corporum uteretur , coacta stabile ad proelium$$ The Germans were equally brave ,  but they were beaten by the nature of the fighting and of the weapons ,  for their vast host in so confined a space could neither thrust out nor recover their immense lances ,  or avail themselves of their nimble movements and lithe frames ,  forced as they were to a close engagement
 contra miles , cui scutum pecotri adpressum et insidens capulo manus , latos barbarorum artus , nuda ora foderet viamque strage hostium aperiret , inprompto iam Arminio ob continua pericula , sive illum recens acceptum vulnus tardaverat$$ Our soldiers ,  on the other hand ,  with their shields pressed to their breasts ,  and their hands grasping their sword-hilts ,  struck at the huge limbs and exposed faces of the barbarians ,  cutting a passage through the slaughtered enemy ,  for Arminius was now less active ,  either from incessant perils ,  or because he was partially disabled by his recent wound
 quin et Inguiomerum , tota volitantem acie , fortuna magis quam virtus deserebat$$ As for Inguiomerus ,  who flew hither and thither over the battlefield ,  it was fortune rather than courage which forsook him
 et Germanicus quo magis adgnosceretur detraxerat tegimen capitii orabatque insisterent caedibus nil opus captivis , solam internicionem gentis finem bello fore$$ Germanicus ,  too ,  that he might be the better known ,  took his helmet off his head and begged his men to follow up the slaughter ,  as they wanted not prisoners ,  and the utter destruction of the nation would be the only conclusion of the war
 iamque sero diei subducit ex acie legionem faciendis castris ceterae ad noctem cruore hostium satiatae sunt$$ And now ,  late in the day ,  he withdrew one of his legions from the field ,  to intrench a camp ,  while the rest till nightfall glutted themselves with the enemy's blood

 quibus paulum aegreque vitatis , postquam mutabat aestus eodemque quo ventus ferebat , non adhaerere ancoris , non exhaurire inrumpentis undas poterant$$ these they just escaped ,  with difficulty ,  and when the tide changed and bore them the same way as the wind ,  they could not hold to their anchors or bale out the water which rushed in upon them
 equi , iumenta , sarcinae , etiam arma praecipitantur quo levarentur alvei manantes per latera et fluctu superurgente$$ Horses ,  beasts of burden ,  baggage ,  were thrown overboard ,  in order to lighten the hulls which leaked copiously through their sides ,  while the waves too dashed over them
 Quanto violentior cetero mari Oceanus et truculentia caeli praestat Germania , tantum illa clades novitate et magnitudine excessit , hostilibus circum litoribus aut ita vasto et profundo ut credatur novissimum ac sine terris mare$$ As the ocean is stormier than all other seas ,  and as Germany is conspicuous for the terrors of its climate ,  so in novelty and extent did this disaster transcend every other ,  for all around were hostile coasts ,  or an expanse so vast and deep that it is thought to be the remotest shoreless sea
 pars navium haustae sunt , plures apud insulas longius sitas eiectae$$ Some of the vessels were swallowed up
 milesque nullo illic hominum cultu fame absumptus , nisi quos corpora equorum eodem elisa toleraverant$$ many were wrecked on distant islands ,  and the soldiers ,  finding there no form of human life ,  perished of hunger ,  except some who supported existence on carcases of horses washed on the same shores
 sola Germanici triremis Chaucorum terram adpulit$$ Germanicus's trireme alone reached the country of the Chauci
 quem per omnis illos dies noctesque apud scopulos et prominentis oras , cum se tanti exitii reum clamitaret , vix cohibuere amici quo minus eodem mari oppeteret$$ Day and night ,  on those rocks and promontories he would incessantly exclaim that he was himself responsible for this awful ruin ,  and friends scarce restrained him from seeking death in the same sea
 tandem relabente aestu et secundante vento claudae naves raro remigio aut intentis vestibus , et quaedam a validioribus tractae , revertere$$ At last ,  as the tide ebbed and the wind blew favourably ,  the shattered vessels with but few rowers ,  or clothing spread as sails ,  some towed by the more powerful ,  returned ,  and Germanicus ,  having speedily repaired them ,  sent them to search the islands

 Sed fama classis amissae ut Germanos ad spem belli , ita Caesarem ad coercendum erexit$$ Meanwhile the rumoured loss of the fleet stirred the Germans to hope for war ,  as it did Caesar to hold them down
 Gaius Silio cum triginta peditum , tribus equitum milibus ire in Chattos imperat$$ He ordered Caius Silius with thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry to march against the Chatti
 ipse maioribus copiis Marsos inrumpit , quorum dux Mallovendus nuper in deditionem acceptus propinquo luco defossam Varianae legionis aquilam modico praesidio servari indicat$$ He himself ,  with a larger army ,  invaded the Marsi ,  whose leader ,  Mallovendus ,  whom we had lately admitted to surrender ,  pointed out a neighbouring wood ,  where ,  he said ,  an eagle of one of Varus's legions was buried and guarded only by a small force
 missa extemplo manus quae hostem a fronte eliceret , alii qui terga circumgressi recluderent humum$$ Immediately troops were despatched to draw the enemy from his position by appearing in his front ,  others ,  to hem in his rear and open the ground
 et utrisque adfuit fortuna$$ Fortune favoured both
 eo promptior Caesar pergit introrsus , populatur , excindit non ausum congredi hostem aut , sicubi restiterat , statim pulsum nec umquam magis , ut ex captivis cognitum est , paventem$$ So Germanicus ,  with increased energy ,  advanced into the country ,  laying it waste ,  and utterly ruining a foe who dared not encounter him ,  or who was instantly defeated wherever he resisted ,  and ,  as we learnt from prisoners ,  was never more panic-stricken
 quippe invictos et nullis casibas superabilis Romanos praedicabant , qui perdita classe , amissis armis , post constrata equorum virorumque corporibus litora eadem virtute , pari ferocia et velut aucti numero inrupissent$$ The Romans ,  they declared ,  were invincible ,  rising superior to all calamities for having thrown away a fleet ,  having lost their arms ,  after strewing the shores with the carcases of horses and of men ,  they had rushed to the attack with the same courage ,  with equal spirit ,  and ,  seemingly ,  with augmented numbers
 Vt satis testium et qui servi eadem noscerent repperit , aditum ad principem postulat , demonstrato crimine et reo per Flaccum Vescularium equitem Romanum , cui propior cum Tiberio usus erat$$ As soon as he found enough witnesses ,  with some slaves who knew the facts ,  he begged an audience of the emperor ,  after first indicating the crime and the criminal through Flaccus Vescularius ,  a Roman knight ,  who was more intimate with Tiberius than himself
 Caesar indicium haud aspernatus congressus abnuit posse enim eodem Flacco internuntio sermones commeare$$ Caesar ,  without disregarding the information ,  declined an interview ,  for the communication ,  he said ,  might be conveyed to him through the same messenger ,  Flaccus

 Libo interim veste mutata cum primoribus feminis circumire domos , orare adfinis , vocem adversum pericula poscere , abouentibus cunctis , cum diversa praetenderent , eadem formidine$$ Libo meanwhile ,  in mourning apparel and accompanied by ladies of the highest rank ,  went to house after house ,  entreating his relatives ,  and imploring some eloquent voice to ward off his perils which all refused ,  on different pretexts ,  but from the same apprehension
 die senatus metu et aegritudine fessus , sive , ut tradidere quidam , simulato morbo , lectica delatus ad foris curiae innisusque fratri et manus ac supplices voces ad Tiberium tendens immoto eius vultu excipitur$$ On the day the Senate met ,  jaded with fear and mental anguish ,  or ,  as some have related ,  feigning illness ,  he was carried in a litter to the doors of the Senate House ,  and leaning on his brother he raised his hands and voice in supplication to Tiberius ,  who received him with unmoved countenance
 mox libellos et auctores recitat Caesar ita moderans ne lenire neve asperare crimina videretur$$ The emperor then read out the charges and the accusers' names ,  with such calmness as not to seem to soften or aggravate the accusations
 Accesserant praeter Trionem et Catum accusatores Fonteius Agrippa et Gaius Vibius , certabantque cui ius perorandi in reum daretur , donec Vibius , quia nec ipsi inter se concederent et Libo sine patrono introisset , singillatim se crimina obiecturum professus , protulit libellos vaecordes adeo ut consultaverit Libo an habiturus foret opes quis viam Appiam Brundisium usque pecunia operiret$$ Besides Trio and Catus ,  Fonteius Agrippa and Caius Vibius were among his accusers ,  and claimed with eager rivalry the privilege of conducting the case for the prosecution ,  till Vibius ,  as they would not yield one to the other ,  and Libo had entered without counsel ,  offered to state the charges against him singly ,  and produced an extravagantly absurd accusation ,  according to which Libo had consulted persons whether he would have such wealth as to be able to cover the Appian road as far as Brundisium with money
 inerant et alia huiusce modi stolida vana , si mollius acciperes , misemuda$$ There were other questions of the same sort ,  quite senseless and idle
 uni tamen libello manu Libonis nominibus Caesarum aut senatorum additas atrocis vel occultas notas accusator arguebat$$ if leniently regarded ,  pitiable But there was one paper in Libo's handwriting ,  so the prosecutor alleged ,  with the names of Caesars and of Senators ,  to which marks were affixed of dreadful or mysterious significance
 negante reo adgnoscentis servos per tormenta interrogari placuit$$ When the accused denied this ,  it was decided that his slaves who recognised the writing should be examined by torture
 et quia vetere senatus consulto quaestio in caput domini prohibebatur , callidus et novi iuris repertor Tiberius mancipari singulos actori publico iubet , scilicet ut in Libonem ex servis salvo senatus consulto quaereretur$$ As an ancient statute of the Senate forbade such inquiry in a case affecting a master's life ,  Tiberius ,  with his cleverness in devising new law ,  ordered Libo's slaves to be sold singly to the State-agent ,  so that ,  forsooth ,  without an infringement of the Senate's decree ,  Libo might be tried on their evidence
 ob quae posterum diem reus petivit domumque digressus extremas preces Publius Quirinio propinquo suo ad principem mandavit$$ As a consequence ,  the defendant asked an adjournment till next day ,  and having gone home he charged his kinsman ,  Publius Quirinus ,  with his last prayer to the emperor
 Responsum est ut senatum rogaret$$ The answer was that he should address himself to the Senate
 cingebatur interim milite domus , strepebant etiam in vestibulo ut audiri , ut aspici possent , cum Libo ipsis quas in novissimam voluptatem adhibuerat epulis excruciatus vocare percussorem , prensare servorum dextras , inserere gladium$$ Meanwhile his house was surrounded with soldiers they crowded noisily even about the entrance ,  so that they could be heard and seen when Libo ,  whose anguish drove him from the very banquet he had prepared as his last gratification ,  called for a minister of death ,  grasped the hands of his slaves ,  and thrust a sword into them
 atque illis , dum trepidant , dum refugiunt , evertentibus adpositum cum mensa lumen , feralibus iam sibi tenebris duos ictus in viscera derexit$$ In their confusion ,  as they shrank back ,  they overturned the lamp on the table at his side ,  and in the darkness ,  now to him the gloom of death ,  he aimed two blows at a vital part
 ad gemitum conlabentis adcurrere liberti , et caede visa miles abstitit$$ At the groans of the falling man his freedmen hurried up ,  and the soldiers ,  seeing the bloody deed ,  stood aloof
 accusatio tamen apud patres adseveratione eadem peracta , iuravitque Tiberius petiturum se vitam quamvis nocenti , nisi voluntariam mortem properavisset$$ Yet the prosecution was continued in the Senate with the same persistency ,  and Tiberius declared on oath that he would have interceded for his life ,  guilty though he was ,  but for his hasty suicide
 Bona inter accusatores dividuntur , et praeturae extra ordinem datae iis qui senatorii ordinis erant$$ His property was divided among his accusers ,  and praetorships out of the usual order were conferred on those who were of senators' rank
 tunc Cotta Messalinus , ne imago Libonis exequias posterorum comitaretur , censuit , Gnaeus Lentulus , ne quis Scribonius cognomentum Drusi adsumeret$$ Cotta Messalinus then proposed that Libo's bust should not be carried in the funeral procession of any of his descendants and Cneius Lentulus ,  that no Scribonius should assume the surname of Drusus
 supplicationum dies Pomponii Flacci sententia constituti , dona Iovi , Marti , Concordiae , utque idumn Septembrium dies , quo se Libo interfecerat , dies festus haberetur , Lucius Piso et Gallus Asinius et Papius Mutilus et Lucius Apronius decrevere$$ Days of public thanksgiving were appointed on the suggestion of Pomponius Flaccus Offerings were given to Jupiter ,  Mars ,  and Concord ,  and the 13th day of September ,  on which Libo had killed himself ,  was to be observed as a festival ,  on the motion of Gallus Asinius ,  Papius Mutilus ,  and Lucius Apronius

 Pro  atus die multa in luxum civitatis dicta a Quintus Haterio consulari , Octavio Frontone praetura functo$$ On the next day of the Senate's meeting much was said against the luxury of the country by Quintus Haterius ,  an ex-consul ,  and by Octavius Fronto ,  an ex-praetor
 decretumque ne vasa auro solida ministrandis cibis fierent , ne vestis serica viros foedaret$$ It was decided that vessels of solid gold should not be made for the serving of food ,  and that men should not disgrace themselves with silken clothing from the East

 erat quippe adhuc frequens senatoribus , si quid e re publica crederent , loco sententiae promere$$ It was indeed still usual with the Senators ,  when it was their turn to vote ,  to suggest anything they thought for the State's advantage
 contra Gallus Asinius disseruit$$ Gallus Asinius argued on the other side
 auctu imperii adolevisse etiam privatas opes , idque non novum , sed e vetustissimis moribus$$ With the growth of the empire private wealth too ,  he said ,  had increased ,  and there was nothing new in this ,  but it accorded with the fashions of the earliest antiquity
 aliam apud Fabricios , aliam apud Scipiones pecuniam$$ Riches were one thing with the Fabricii ,  quite another with the Scipios
 et cuncta ad rem publicam referri , qua tenui angustas civium domos , postquam eo magnificentiae venerit , gliscere singulos$$ The State was the standard of everything when it was poor ,  the homes of the citizens were humble
 neque in familia et argento quaeque ad usum parentur nimium aliquid aut modicum nisi ex fortuna possidentis$$ when it reached such magnificence ,  private grandeur increased In household establishments ,  and plate ,  and in whatever was provided for use ,  there was neither excess nor parsimony except in relation to the fortune of the possessor
 distinctos senatus et equitum census , non quia diversi natura , sed ut locis ordinibus dignationibus antistent , ita iis quae ad requiem animi aut salubritatem corporum parentur , nisi forte clarissimo cuique pluris curas , maiora pericula subeunda , delenimentis curarum et periculorum carendum esse$$ A distinction had been made in the assessments of Senators and knights ,  not because they differed naturally ,  but that the superiority of the one class in places in the theatre ,  in rank and in honour ,  might be also maintained in everything else which insured mental repose and bodily recreation ,  unless indeed men in the highest position were to undergo more anxieties and more dangers ,  and to be at the same time deprived of all solace under those anxieties and dangers
 facilem adsensum Gallo sub nominibus honestis confessio vitiorum et similitudo audientium dedit$$ Gallus gained a ready assent ,  under these specious phrases ,  by a confession of failings with which his audience symphathised
 adiecerat et Tiberius non id tempus censurae nec , si quid in moribus labaret , defuturum corrigendi auctorem$$ And Tiberius too had added that this was not a time for censorship ,  and that if there were any declension in manners ,  a promoter of reform would not be wanting
 Inter quae Lucius Piso ambitum fori , corrupta iudicia , saevitiam oratorum accusationes minitantium increpans , abire se et cedere urbe , victurum in aliquo abdito et longinquo rure testabatur$$ During this debate Lucius Piso ,  after exclaiming against the corruption of the courts ,  the bribery of judges ,  the cruel threats of accusations from hired orators ,  declared that he would depart and quit the capital ,  and that he meant to live in some obscure and distant rural retreat
 simul curiam relinquebat$$ At the same moment he rose to leave the Senate House
 commotus est Tiberius , et quamquam mitibus verbis Pisonem permulsisset , propinquos quoque eius impulit ut abeuntem auctoritate vel precibus tenerent$$ Tiberius was much excited ,  and though he pacified Piso with gentle words ,  he also strongly urged his relatives to stop his departure by their influence or their entreaties
 haud minus liberi doloris documentum idem Piso mox dedit vocata in ius Vrgulania , quam supra leges amicitia Augustae extulerat$$ Soon afterwards this same Piso gave an equal proof of a fearless sense of wrong by suing Urgulania ,  whom Augusta's friendship had raised above the law
 nec aut Vrgulania optemperavit , in domum Caesaris spreto Pisone vecta , aut ille abscessit , quamquam Augusta se violari et imminui quereretur$$ Neither did Urgulania obey the summons ,  for in defiance of Piso she went in her litter to the emperor's house
 Tiberius hactenus indulgere matri civile ratus , ut se iturum ad praetoris tribunal , adfuturum Vrgulaniae diceret , processit Palatio , procul sequi iussis militibus$$ nor did Piso give way ,  though Augusta complained that she was insulted and her majesty slighted Tiberius ,  to win popularity by so humouring his mother as to say that he would go to the praetor's court and support Urgulania ,  went forth from the palace ,  having ordered soldiers to follow him at a distance
 spectabatur occursante populo compositus ore et sermonibus variis tempus atque iter ducens , donec propinquis Pisonem frustra coercentibus deferri Augusta pecuniam quae petebatur iuberet$$ He was seen ,  as the people thronged about him ,  to wear a calm face ,  while he prolonged his time on the way with various conversations ,  till at last when Piso's relatives tried in vain to restrain him ,  Augusta directed the money which was claimed to be handed to him
 isque finis rei , ex qua neque Piso inglorius et Caesar maiore fama fuit$$ This ended the affair ,  and Piso ,  in consequence ,  was not dishonoured ,  and the emperor rose in reputation
 ceterum Vrgulaniae potentia adeo nimia civitati erat ut testis in causa quadam , quae apud senatum tractabatur , venire dedignaretur$$ Urgulania's influence ,  however ,  was so formidable to the State ,  that in a certain cause which was tried by the Senate she would not condescend to appear as a witness
 missus est praetor qui domi interrogaret , cum virgines Vestales in foro et iudicio audiri , quotiens testimonium dicerent , vetus mos fuerit$$ The praetor was sent to question her at her own house ,  although the Vestal virgins ,  according to ancient custom ,  were heard in the courts ,  before judges ,  whenever they gave evidence
 Res eo anno prolatas haud referrem , ni pretium foret Gnaeus Pisonis et Asinii Galli super eo negotio diversas sententias noscere$$ I should say nothing of the adjournment of public business in this year ,  if it were not worth while to notice the conflicting opinions of Cneius Piso and Asinius Gallus on the subject
 Piso , quamquam afuturum se dixerat Caesar , ob id magis agendas censebat , ut absente principe senatum et equites posse sua munia sustinere decorum rei publicae foret$$ Piso ,  although the emperor had said that he would be absent ,  held that all the more ought the business to be transacted ,  that the State might have honour of its Senate and knights being able to perform their duties in the sovereign's absence
 Gallus , quia speciem libertatis Piso praeceperat , nihil satis inlustre aut ex dignitate populi Romani nisi coram et sub oculis Caesaris , eoque conventum Italiae et adfluentis provincias praesentiae eius servanda dicebat$$ Gallus ,  as Piso had forestalled him in the display of freedom ,  maintained that nothing was sufficiently impressive or suitable to the majesty of the Roman people ,  unless done before Caesar and under his very eyes ,  and that therefore the gathering from all Italy and the influx from the provinces ought to be reserved for his presence
 audiente haec Tiberio ac silente magnis utrimque contentionibus acta , sed res dilatae$$ Tiberius listened to this in silence ,  and the matter was debated on both sides in a sharp controversy
 Et certamen Gallo adversus Caesarem exortum est$$ A dispute then arose between Gallus and the emperor
 nam censuit in quinquennium magistratuum comitia habenda , utque legionum legati , qui ante praeturam ea militia fungebantur , iam tum praetores destinarentur , princeps duodecim candidatos in annos singulos nominaret$$ Gallus proposed that the elections of magistrates should be held every five years ,  and that the commanders of the legions who before receiving a praetorship discharged this military service should at once become praetorselect ,  the emperor nominating twelve candidates every year
 haud dubium erat eam sententiam altius penetrare et arcana imperii temptari$$ It was quite evident that this motion had a deeper meaning and was an attempt to explore the secrets of imperial policy
 Tiberius tamen , quasi augeretur potestas eius , disseruit$$ Tiberius ,  however ,  argued as if his power would be thus increased
 grave moderationi suae tot eligere , tot differre$$ It would ,  he said ,  be trying to his moderation to have to elect so many and to put off so many
 vix per singulos annos offensiones vitari , quamvis repulsam propinqua spes soletur$$ He scarcely avoided giving offence from year to year ,  even though a candidate's rejection was solaced by the near prospect of office
 quantum odii fore ab iis qui ultra quinquennium proiciantur unde prospici posse quae cuique tam longo temporis spatio mens , domus , fortuna$$ What hatred would be incurred from those whose election was deferred for five years! How could he foresee through so long an interval what would be a man's temper ,  or domestic relations ,  or estate
 superbire homines etiam annua designatione$$ Men became arrogant even with this annual appointment
 quid si honorem per quinquennium agitent$$ What would happen if their thoughts were fixed on promotion for five years
 quinquiplicari prorsus magistratus , subverti leges , quae sua spatia exercendae candidatorum industriae quaerendisque aut potiundis honoribus statuerint$$ It was in fact a multiplying of the magistrates five-fold ,  and a subversion of the laws which had prescribed proper periods for the exercise of the candidate's activity and the seeking or securing office
 favorabili in speciem oratione vim imperii tenuit$$ With this seemingly conciliatory speech he retained the substance of power
 Inclinatio senatus incitamentum Tiberio fuit quo promptius adversaretur , his ferme verbis usus$$ The Senate's favourable bias was an incitement to Tiberius to offer prompt opposition ,  which he did in nearly these words 
 si quantum pauperum est venire huc et liberis suis petere pecunias coeperint , singuli numquam exsatiabuntur , res publica deficiet$$  , If all poor men begin to come here and to beg money for their children ,  individuals will never be satisfied ,  and the State will be bankrupt
 nec sane ideo a maioribus concessum est egredi aliquando relationem et quod in commune conducat loco sententiae proferre , ut privata negotia et res familiaris nostras hic augeamus , cum invidia senatus et principum , sive indulserint largitionem sive abnuerint$$ Certainly our ancestors did not grant the privilege of occasionally proposing amendments or of suggesting ,  in our turn for speaking ,  something for the general advantage in order that we might in this house increase our private business and property ,  thereby bringing odium on the Senate and on emperors whether they concede or refuse their bounty
 non enim preces sunt istud , sed efflagitatio , intempestiva quidem et inprovisa , cum aliis de rebus convenerint patres , consurgere et numero atque aetate liberum suorum urgere modestiam senatus , eandem vim in me transmittere ac velut perfringere aerarium , quod si ambitione exhauserimus , per scelera supplendum erit$$ In fact ,  it is not a request ,  but an importunity ,  as utterly unreasonable as it is unforeseen ,  for a senator ,  when the house has met on other matters ,  to rise from his place and ,  pleading the number and age of his children ,  put a pressure on the delicacy of the Senate ,  then transfer the same constraint to myself ,  and ,  as it were ,  break open the exchequer ,  which ,  if we exhaust it by improper favouritism ,  will have to be replenished by crimes
 dedit tibi , Hortale , divus Augustus pecuniam , sed non conpellatus nec en lege ut semper daretur$$ Money was given you ,  Hortalus ,  by Augustus ,  but without solicitation ,  and not on the condition of its being always given
 languescet alioqui industria , intendetur socordia , si nullus ex se metus aut spes , et securi omnes aliena subsidia expectabunt , sibi ignavi , nobis graves$$ Otherwise industry will languish and idleness be encouraged ,  if a man has nothing to fear ,  nothing to hope from himself ,  and every one ,  in utter recklessness ,  will expect relief from others ,  thus becoming useless to himself and a burden to me
 haec atque talia , quamquam cum adsensu audita ab iis quibus omnia principum , honesta atque inhonesta , laudare mos est , plures per silentium aut occultum murmur excepere$$ These and like remarks ,  though listened to with assent by those who make it a practice to eulogise everything coming from sovereigns ,  both good and bad ,  were received by the majority in silence or with suppressed murmurs
 sensitque Tiberius et cum paulum reticuisset , Hortalo se respondisse ait ceterum si patribus videretur , daturum liberis eius ducena sestertia singulis , qui sexus virilis essent$$ Tiberius perceived it ,  and having paused a while ,  said that he had given Hortalus his answer ,  but that if the senators thought it right ,  he would bestow two hundred thousand sesterces on each of his children of the male sex
 egere alii grates$$ The others thanked him
 siluit Hortalus , pavore an avitae nobilitatis etiam inter angustias fortunae retinens$$ Hortalus said nothing ,  either from alarm or because even in his reduced fortunes he clung to his hereditary nobility
 neque miseratus est posthac Tiberius , quamvis domus Hortensii pudendam ad inopiam delaberetur$$ Nor did Tiberius afterwards show any pity ,  though the house of Hortensius sank into shameful poverty
 Vulgabatur interim per Italiam servatum munere deum Agrippam , credebatur Romae$$ It was rumoured meanwhile throughout Italy ,  and was believed at Rome ,  that Agrippa had been saved by the blessing of Heaven
 iamque Ostiam invectum multitudo ingens , iam in urbe clandestini coetus celebrabant , cum Tiberium anceps cura distrahere , vine militum servum suum coerceret an inanem credulitatem tempore ipso vanescere sineret$$ Already at Ostia ,  where he had arrived ,  he was the centre of interest to a vast concourse as well as to secret gatherings in the capital ,  while Tiberius was distracted by the doubt whether he should crush this slave of his by military force or allow time to dissipate a silly credulity
 modo nihil spernendum , modo non omnia metuenda ambiguus pudoris ac metus reputabat$$ Sometimes he thought that he must overlook nothing ,  sometimes that he need not be afraid of everything ,  his mind fluctuating between shame and terror
 postremo dat negotium Sallustio Crispo ille e clientibus duos (quidam milites fuisse tradunt) deligit atque hortatur , simulata conscientia adeant , offerant pecuniam , fidem atque pericula polliceantur$$ At last he entrusted the affair to Sallustius Crispus ,  who chose two of his dependants (some say they were soldiers) and urged them to go to him as pretended accomplices ,  offering money and promising faithful companionship in danger
 exequuntur ut iussum erat$$ They did as they were bidden
 dein speculati noctem incustoditam , accepta idonea manu , vinctum clauso ore in Palatium traxere$$ then ,  waiting for an unguarded hour of night ,  they took with them a sufficient force ,  and having bound and gagged him ,  dragged him to the palace
 percontanti Tiberio quo modo Agrippa factus esset respondisse fertur quo modo tu Caesar$$ When Tiberius asked him how he had become Agrippa ,  he is said to have replied ,  As you became Caesar
 ut ederet socios subigi non potuit$$ He could not be forced to divulge his accomplices
 nec Tiberius poenam eius palam ausus , in secreta Palatii parte interfici iussit corpusque clam auferri$$ Tiberius did not venture on a public execution ,  but ordered him to be slain in a private part of the palace and his body to be secretly removed
 et quamquam multi e domo principis equitesque ac senatores sustentasse opibus , iuvisse consiliis dicerentur , haud quaesitum$$ And although many of the emperor's household and knights and senators were said to have supported him with their wealth and helped him with their counsels ,  no inquiry was made
 Fine anni arcus propter aedem Saturni ob recepta signa cum Varo amissa ductu Germanici , auspiciis Tiberii , et aedes Fortis Fortunae Tiberim iuxta in hortis , quos Caesar dictator populo Romano legaverat , sacrarium genti Iuliae effigiesque divo Augusto apud Bovillas dicantur$$ At the close of the year was consecrated an arch near the temple of Saturn to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost with Varus ,  under the leadership of Germanicus and the auspices of Tiberius a temple of Fors Fortuna ,  by the Tiber ,  in the gardens which Caesar ,  the dictator ,  bequeathed to the Roman people a chapel to the Julian family ,  and statues at Bovillae to the Divine Augustus
 Gaius Caelio Lucius Pomponio consulibus Germanicus Caesar ante diem VII Kalends Iunias triumphavit de Cheruscis Chattisque et Angrivariis quaeque aliae nationes usque ad Albim colunt$$ In the consulship of Caius Caecilius and Lucius Pomponius ,  Germanicus Caesar ,  on the 26th day of May ,  celebrated his triumph over the Cherusci ,  Chatti ,  and Angrivarii ,  and the other tribes which extend as far as the Elbe
 vecta spolia , captivi , simulacra montium , fluminum , proeliorum$$ There were borne in procession spoils ,  prisoners ,  representations of the mountains ,  the rivers and battles
 bellumque , quia conficere prohibitus erat , pro confecto accipiebatur$$ and the war ,  seeing that he had been forbidden to finish it ,  was taken as finished
 augebat intuentium visus eximia ipsius species currusque quinque liberis onustus$$ The admiration of the beholders was heightened by the striking comeliness of the general and the chariot which bore his five children
 sed suberat occulta formido , reputantibus haud prosperum in Druso patre eius favorem vulgi , avunculum eiusdem Marcellum flagrantibus plebis studiis intra inventam ereptum , brevis et infaustos populi Romani amores$$ Still ,  there was a latent dread when they remembered how unfortunate in the case of Drusus ,  his father ,  had been the favour of the crowd how his uncle Marcellus ,  regarded by the city populace with passionate enthusiasm ,  had been snatched from them while yet a youth ,  and how short-lived and ill-starred were the attachments of the Roman people
 Ceterum Tiberius nomine Germanici trecenos plebi sestertios viritim dedit seque collegam consulatui eius destinavit$$ Tiberius meanwhile in the name of Germanicus gave every one of the city populace three hundred sesterces ,  and nominated himself his colleague in the consulship
 nec ideo sincerae caritatis fidem adsecutus amoliri iuvenem specie honoris statuit struxitque causas aut forte oblatas arripuit$$ Still ,  failing to obtain credit for sincere affection ,  he resolved to get the young prince out of the way ,  under pretence of conferring distinction ,  and for this he invented reasons ,  or eagerly fastened on such as chance presented
 rex Archelaus quinquagesimum annum Cappadocia potiebatur , invisus Tiberio quod eum Rhodi agentem nullo officio coluisset$$ King Archelaus had been in possession of Cappadocia for fifty years ,  and Tiberius hated him because he had not shown him any mark of respect while he was at Rhodes
 nec id Archelaus per superbiam omiserat , sed ab intimis Augusti monitus , quia florente Gaio Caesare missoque ad res Orientis intuta Tiberii amicitia credebatur$$ This neglect of Archelaus was not due to pride ,  but was suggested by the intimate friends of Augustus ,  because ,  when Caius Caesar was in his prime and had charge of the affairs of the East ,  Tiberius's friendship was thought to be dangerous
 ut versa Caesarum subole imperium adeptus est , elicit Archelaum matris litteris , quae non dissimulatis filii offensionibus clementiam offerebae , si ad precandum veniret$$ When ,  after the extinction of the family of the Caesars ,  Tiberius acquired the empire ,  he enticed Archelaus by a letter from his mother ,  who without concealing her son's displeasure promised mercy if he would come to beg for it
 ille ignarus doli vel , si intellegere crederetur , vim metuens in urbem properat$$ Archelaus ,  either quite unsuspicious of treachery ,  or dreading compulsion ,  should it be thought that he saw through it ,  hastened to Rome
 exceptusque immiti a principe et mox accusatus in senatu , non ob crimina quae fingebantur sed angore , simul fessus senio et quia regibus aequa , nedum infima insolita sunt , finem vitae sponte an fato implevit$$ There he was received by a pitiless emperor ,  and soon afterwards was arraigned before the Senate In his anguish and in the weariness of old age ,  and from being unused ,  as a king ,  to equality ,  much less to degradation ,  not ,  certainly ,  from fear of the charges fabricated against him ,  he ended his life ,  by his own act or by a natural death
 regnum in provinciam redactum est , fructibusque eius levari posse centesimae vectigal professus Caesar ducentesimam in posterum statuit$$ His kingdom was reduced into a province ,  and Caesar declared that ,  with its revenues ,  the one per cent

 et provinciae Syria atque Iudaea , fessae oneribus , deminutionem tributi orabant$$ The provinces too of Syria and Judaea ,  exhausted by their burdens ,  implored a reduction of tribute
 Igitur haec et de Armenia quae supra memoravi apud patres disseruit , nec posse motum Orientem nisi Germanici sapientia conponi$$ Tiberius accordingly discussed these matters and the affairs of Armenia ,  which I have already related ,  before the Senate
 nam suam aetatem vergere , Drusi nondum satis adolevisse$$ The commotions in the East ,  he said ,  could be quieted only by the wisdom ,  of Germanicus
 tunc decreto patrum per missae Germanico provinciae quae mari dividuntur , maiusque imperium , quoquo adisset , quam iis qui sorte aut missu principis obtinerent sed Tiberius demoverat Syria Creticum Silanum , per adfinitatem conexam Germanico , quia Silani filia Neroni vetustissimo liberorum eius pacta erat , praefeceratque Gnaeus Pisonem , ingenio violentum et obsequii ignarum , insita ferocia a patre Pisone qui civili bello resurgentis in Africa partis acerrimo ministerio adversus Caesarem iuvit , mox Brutum et Cassium secutus concesso reditu petitione honorum abstinuit , donec ultro ambiretur delatum ab Augusto consulatum accipere$$ own life was on the decline ,  and Drusus had not yet reached his maturity Thereupon ,  by a decree of the Senate ,  the provinces beyond sea were entrusted to Germanicus ,  with greater powers wherever he went than were given to those who obtained their provinces by lot or by the emperor's appointment Tiberius had however removed from Syria Creticus Silanus ,  who was connected by a close tie with Germanicus ,  his daughter being betrothed to Nero ,  the eldest of Germanicus's children He appointed to it Cneius Piso ,  a man of violent temper ,  without an idea of obedience ,  with indeed a natural arrogance inherited from his father Piso ,  who in the civil war supported with the most energetic aid against Caesar the reviving faction in Africa ,  then embraced the cause of Brutus and Cassius ,  and ,  when suffered to return ,  refrained from seeking promotion till ,  he was actually solicited to accept a consulship offered by Augustus
 sed praeter patemos spiritus uxoris quoque Plancinae nobilitate et opibus accendebatur$$ But beside the father's haughty temper there was also the noble rank and wealth of his wife Plancina ,  to inflame his ambition
 vix Tiberio concedere , liberos eius ut multum infra despectare$$ He would hardly be the inferior of Tiberius ,  and as for Tiberius's children ,  he looked down on them as far beneath him
 nec dubium habebat se delectum qui Syriae imponeretur ad spes Germanici coercendas$$ He thought it a certainty that he had been chosen to govern Syria in order to thwart the aspirations of Germanicus
 credidere quidam data et a Tiberio occulta mandata et Plancinam haud dubie Augusta monuit aemulatione muliebri Agrippinam insectandi divisa namque et discors aula erat tacitis in Drusum aut Germanicum studiis$$ Some believed that he had even received secret instructions from Tiberius ,  and it was beyond a question that Augusta ,  with feminine jealousy ,  had suggested to Plancina calumnious insinuations against Agrippina

 Tiberius atque Augusta publico abstinuere , inferius maiestate sua rati si palam lamentarentur , an ne omnium oculis vultum eorum scrutantibus falsi intellegerentur$$ Tiberius Augusta refrained from showing themselves ,  thinking it below their dignity to shed tears in public ,  or else fearing that ,  if all eyes scrutinised their faces ,  their hypocrisy would be revealed
 matrem Antoniam non apud auctores rerum , non diurna actorum scriptura reperio ullo insigni officio functam , cum super Agrippinam et Drusum et Claudium ceteri quoque consanguinei nominatim perscripti sint , seu valetudine praepediebatur seu victus luctu animus magnitudinem mali perferre visu non toleravit$$ I do not find in any historian or in the daily register that Antonia ,  Germanicus's mother ,  rendered any conspicuous honour to the deceased ,  though besides Agrippina ,  Drusus ,  and Claudius ,  all his other kinsfolk are mentioned by name She may either have been hindered by illness ,  or with a spirit overpowered by grief she may not have had the heart to endure the sight of so great an affliction
 facilius crediderim Tiberio et Augusta , qui domo non excedebant , cohibitam , ut par maeror et matris exemplo avia quoque et patruus attineri viderentur$$ But I can more easily believe that Tiberius and Augusta ,  who did not leave the palace ,  kept her within ,  that their sorrow might seem equal to hers ,  and that the grandmother and uncle might be thought to follow the mother's example in staying at home
 Dies quo reliquiae tumulo Augusti inferebantur modo per silentium vastus , modo ploratibus inquies$$ The day on which the remains were consigned to the tomb of Augustus ,  was now desolate in its silence ,  now distracted by lamentations
 plena urbis itinera , conlucentes per campum Martis faces$$ The streets of the city were crowded torches were blazing throughout the Campus Martius
 illic miles cum armis , sine insignibus magistratus , populus per tribus concidisse rem publicam , nihil spei reliquum clamitabant , promptius apertiusque quam ut meminisse imperitantium crederes$$ There the soldiers under arms ,  the magistrates without their symbols of office ,  the people in the tribes ,  were all incessantly exclaiming that the commonwealth was ruined ,  that not a hope remained ,  too boldly and openly to let one think that they remembered their rulers
 nihil tamen Tiberium magis penetravit quam studia hominum accensa in Agrippinam , cum decus patriae , solum Augusti sanguinem , unicum antiquitatis specimen appellarent versique ad caelum ac deos integram illi subolem ac superstitem iniquorum precarentur$$ But nothing impressed Tiberius more deeply than the enthusiasm kindled in favor of Agrippina ,  whom men spoke of as the glory of the country ,  the sole surviving off spring of Augustus ,  the solitary example of the old times ,  while looking up to heaven and the gods they prayed for the safety of her children and that they might outlive their oppressors
 Fuere qui publici funeris pompam requirerent compararentque quae in Drusum patrem Germanici honora et magnifica Augustus fecisset$$ Some there were who missed the grandeur of a state-funeral ,  and contrasted the splendid honours conferred by Augustus on Drusus ,  the father of Germanicus
 ipsum quippe asperrimo hiemis Ticinum usque progressum neque abscedentem a corpore simul urbem intravisse$$ Then the emperor himself ,  they said ,  went in the extreme rigour of winter as far as Ticinum ,  and never leaving the corpse entered Rome with it
 circumfusas lecto Claudiorum Iuliorumque imagines$$ Round the funeral bier were ranged the images of the Claudii and the Julii
 defletum in foro , laudatum pro rostris , cuncta a maioribus reperta aut quae posteri invenerint cumulata$$ there was weeping in the forum ,  and a panegyric before the rostra every honour devised by our ancestors or invented by their descendants was heaped on him
 at Germanico ne solitos quidem et cuicumque nobili debitos honores contigisse$$ But as for Germanicus ,  even the customary distinctions due to any noble had not fallen to his lot
 sane corpus ob longinquitatem itinerum externis terris quoquo modo crematum sed tanto plura decora mox tribui par fuisse quanto prima fors negavisset$$ Granting that his body ,  because of the distance of tie journey ,  was burnt in any fashion in foreign lands ,  still all the more honours ought to have been afterwards paid him ,  because at first chance had denied them
 non fratrem nisi unius diei via , non patruum saltem porta tenus obvium$$ His brother had gone but one day's journey to meet him
 ubi illa veterum instituta , propositam toro effigiem , meditata ad memoriam virtutis carmina et laudationes et lacrimas vel doloris imitamenta$$ his uncle ,  not even to the city gates Where were all those usages of the past ,  the image at the head of the bier ,  the lays composed in commemoration of worth ,  the eulogies and laments ,  or at least the semblance of grief
 Tum exuto iustitio reditum ad munia , et Drusus Illyricos ad exercitus profectus est , erectis omnium animis petendae e Pisone ultionis et crebro questu , quod vagus interim per amoena Asiae atque Achaiae adroganti et subdola mora scelerum probationes subverteret$$ The suspension of business then ceased ,  and men went back to their occupations Drusus was sent to the armies of Illyricum ,  amidst an universal eagerness to exact vengeance on Piso ,  and ceaseless complaints that he was meantime roaming through the delightful regions of Asia and Achaia ,  and was weakening the proofs of his guilt by an insolent and artful procrastination
 nam vulgatum erat missam , ut dixi , a Gnaeus Sentio famosam veneficiis Martinam subita morte Brundisii extinctam , venenumque nodo crinium eius occultatum nec ulla in corpore signa sumpti exitii reperta$$ It was indeed widely rumoured that the notorius poisoner Martina ,  who ,  as I have related ,  had been despatched to Rome by Cneius Sentius ,  had died suddenly at Brundisium that poison was concealed in a knot of her hair ,  and that no symptoms of suicide were discovered on her person
 At Piso praemisso in urbem filio datisque mandatis per quae principem molliret ad Drusum pergit , quem haud fratris interitu trucem quam remoto aemulo acquiorem sibi sperabat$$ Piso meanwhile sent his son on to Rome with a message intended to pacify the emporer ,  and then made his way to Drusus ,  who would ,  he hoped ,  be not so much infuriated at his brother's death as kindly disposed towards himself in consequence of a rival's removal
 Tiberius quo integrum iudicium ostentaret , exceptum comiter iuvenem sueta erga filios familiarum nobilis liberalitate auget$$ Tiberius ,  to show his impartiality ,  received the youth courteously ,  and enriched him with the liberality he usually bestowed on the sons of noble families
 Drusus Pisoni , si vera forent quae iacerentur , praecipuum in dolore suum locum respondit sed malle falsa et inania nec cuiquam mortem Germanici exitiosam esse$$ Drusus replied to Piso that if certain insinuations were true ,  he must be foremost in his resentment ,  but he preferred to believe that they were false and groundless ,  and that Germanicus's death need be the ruin of no one
 haec palam et vitato omni secreto$$ This he said openly ,  avoiding anything like secrecy
 neque dubitabantur praescripta ei a Tiberio , cum incallidus alioqui et facilis iuventa senilibus tum artibus uteretur$$ Men did not doubt that his answer prescribed him by Tiberius ,  inasmuch as one who had generally all the simplicity and candour of youth ,  now had recourse to the artifices of old age
 Piso Delmatico mari tramisso relictisque apud Anconam navibus per Picenum ac mox Flaminiam viam adsequitur legionem , quae e Pannonia in urbem , dein praesidio Africae ducebatur$$ Piso ,  after crossing the Dalmatian sea and leaving his ships at Ancona ,  went through Picenum and along the Flaminian road ,  where he overtook a legion which was marching from Pannonia to Rome and was then to garrison Africa
 eaque res agitata rumoribus ut in agmine atque itinere crebro se militibus ostentavisset$$ It was a matter of common talk how he had repeatedly displayed himself to the soldiers on the road during the march
 ab Narnia , vitandae suspicionis an quia pavidis consilia in incerto sunt , Nare ac mox Tiberi devectus auxit vulgi iras , quia navem tumulo Caesarum adpulerat dieque et ripa frequenti , magno clientium agmine ipse , feminarum comitatu Plancina et vultu alacres incessere$$ From Narnia ,  to avoid suspicion or because the plans of fear are uncertain ,  he sailed down the Nar ,  then down the Tiber ,  and increased the fury of the populace by bringing his vessel to shore at the tomb of the Caesars In broad daylight ,  when the river-bank was thronged ,  he himself with a numerous following of dependents ,  and Plancina with a retinue of women ,  moved onward with joy in their countenances
 fuit inter inritamenta invidiae domus foro imminens festa ornatu conviviumque et epulae et celebritate loci nihil occultum$$ Among other things which provoked men's anger was his house towering above the forum ,  gay with festal decorations ,  his banquets and his feasts ,  about which there was no secrecy ,  because the place was so public
 Postera die Fuleinius Trio Pisonem apud consules postulavit$$ Next day ,  Fulcinius Trio asked the consul's leave to prosecute Piso
 contra Vitellius ac Veranius ceterique Germanicum comitati tendebant , nullas esse partis Trioni neque se accusatores sed rerum indices et testis mandata Germanici perlaturos$$ It was contended against him by Vitellius and Veranius and the others who had been the companions of Germanicus ,  that this was not Trio's proper part ,  and that they themselves meant to report their instructions from Germanicus ,  not as accusers ,  but as deponents and witnesses to facts
 ille dimissa eius causae delatione , ut priorem vitam accusaret obtinuit , petitumque est a principe cognitionem exciperet$$ Trio ,  abandoning the prosecution on this count ,  obtained leave to accuse Piso's previous career ,  and the emperor was requested to undertake the inquiry
 quod ne reus quidem abnuebat , studia populi et patrum metuens$$ This even the accused did not refuse ,  fearing ,  as he did ,  the bias of the people and of the Senate
 contra Tiberium spernendis rumoribus validum et conscientiae matris innexum esse$$ while Tiberius ,  he knew ,  was resolute enough to despise report ,  and was also entangled in his mother's complicity
 veraque aut in deterius credita indice ab uno facilius discerni , odium et invidiam apud multos valere$$ Truth too would be more easily distinguished from perverse misrepresentation by a single judge ,  where a number would be swayed by hatred and ill-will
 haud fallebat Tiberium moles cognitionis quaque ipse fama distraheretur$$ Tiberius was not unaware of the formidable difficulty of the inquiry and of the rumours by which he was himself assailed
 igitur paucis familiarium adhibitis minas accusantium et hinc preces audit integramque causam ad senatum remittit$$ Having therefore summoned a few intimate friends ,  he listened to the threatening speeches of the prosecutors and to the pleadings of the accused ,  and finally referred the whole case to the Senate
 Atque interim Drusus rediens Illyrico , quamquam patres censuissent ob receptum Maroboduum et res priore aestate gestas ut ovans iniret , prolato honore urbem intravit$$ Drusus meanwhile ,  on his return from Illyricum ,  though the Senate had voted him an ovation for the submission of Maroboduus and the successes of the previous summer ,  postponed the honour and entered Rome
 post quae reo Lucius Arruntium , Publius Vinicium , Asinium Gallum , Aeserninum Marcellum , Sex Pompeium patronos petenti iisque diversa excusantibus M Lepidus et Lucius Piso et Livineius Regulus adfuere , arrecta omni civitate , quanta fides amicis Germanici , quae fiducia reo satin cohiberet ac premeret sensus suos Tiberius$$ Then the defendant sought the advocacy of Lucius Arruntius ,  Marcus Vinicius ,  Asinius Gallus ,  Aeserninus Marcellus and Sextus Pompeius ,  and on their declining for different reasons ,  Marcus Lepidus ,  Lucius Piso ,  and Livineius Regulus became his counsel ,  amid the excitement of the whole country ,  which wondered how much fidelity would be shown by the friends of Germanicus ,  on what the accused rested his hopes ,  and how far Tiberius would repress and hide his feelings
 haud alias intentior populus plus sibi in principem occultae vocis aut suspicacis silentii permisit$$ Never were the people more keenly interested never did they indulge themselves more freely in secret whispers against the emperor or in the silence of suspicion
 Die senatus Caesar orationem habuit meditato temperamento$$ On the day the Senate met ,  Tiberius delivered a speech of studied moderation
 patris sui legatum atque amicum Pisonem fuisse adiutoremque Germanico datum a se auctore senatu rebus apud Orientem administrandis$$ Piso ,  he said ,  was my father's representative and friend ,  and was appointed by myself ,  on the advice of the Senate ,  to assist Germanicus in the administration of the East
 illic contumacia et certaminibus asperasset iuvenem exituque eius laetatus esset an scelere extinxisset , integris animis diiudicandum$$ Whether he there had provoked the young prince by wilful opposition and rivalry ,  and had rejoiced at his death or wickedly destroyed him ,  is for you to determine with minds unbiassed
 nam si legatus officii terminos , obsequium erga imperatorem exuit eiusdemque morte et luctu meo laetatus est , odero seponamque a domo mea et privatas inimicitias non vi principis ulciscar$$ Certainly if a subordinate oversteps the bounds of duty and of obedience to his commander ,  and has exulted in his death and in my affliction ,  I shall hate him and exclude him from my house ,  and I shall avenge a personal quarrel without resorting to my power as emperor
 sin facinus in cuiuscumque mortalium nece vindicandum detegitur , vos vero et liberos Germanici et nos parentes iustis solaciis adficite$$ If however a crime is discovered which ought to be punished ,  whoever the murdered man may be ,  it is for you to give just reparation both to the children of Germanicus and to us ,  his parents
 simulque illud reputate , turbide et seditiose tractaverit exercitus Piso , quaesita sint per ambitionem studia militum , armis repetita provincia , an falsa haec in maius vulgaverint accusatores , quorum ego nimiis studiis iure suscenseo$$ Consider this too ,  whether Piso dealt with the armies in a revolutionary and seditious spirit whether he sought by intrigue popularity with the soldiers whether he attempted to repossess himself of the province by arms ,  or whether these are falsehoods which his accusers have published with exaggeration
 nam quo pertinuit nudare corpus et contrectandum vulgi oculis permittere differrique etiam per externos tamquam veneno interceptus esset , si incerta adhuc ista et scrutanda sunt$$ As for them ,  I am justly angry with their intemperate zeal For to what purpose did they strip the corpse and expose it to the pollution of the vulgar gaze ,  and circulate a story among foreigners that he was destroyed by poison ,  if all this is still doubtful and requires investigation
 defleo equidem filium meum semperque deflebo$$ For my part ,  I sorrow for my son and shall always sorrow for him
 sed neque reum prohibeo quo minus cuncta proferat , quibus innocentia eius sublevari aut , si qua fuit iniquitas Germanici , coargui possit , vosque oro ne , quia dolori meo causa conexa est , obiecta crimina pro adprobatis accipiatis$$ still I would not hinder the accused from producing all the evidence which can relieve his innocence or convict Germanicus of any unfairness ,  if such there was And I implore you not to take as proven charges alleged ,  merely because the case is intimately bound up with my affliction
 si quos propinquus sanguis aut fides sua patronos dedit , quantum quisque eloquentia et cura valet , iuvate periclitantem$$ Do you ,  whom ties of blood or your own true-heartedness have made his advocates ,  help him in his peril ,  every one of you ,  as far as each man's eloquence and diligence can do so
 ad eundem laborem , eandem constantiam accusatores hortor$$ To like exertions and like persistency I would urge the prosecutors
 id solum Germanico super leges praestiterimus , quod in curia potius quam in foro , apud senatum quam apud iudices de morte eius anquiritur$$ In this ,  and in this only ,  will we place Germanicus above the laws ,  by conducting the inquiry into his death in this house instead of in the forum ,  and before the Senate instead of before a bench of judges
 cetera pari modestia tractentur$$ In all else let the case be tried as simply as others
 nemo Drusi lacrimas , nemo maestitiam meam spectet , nec si qua in nos adversa finguntur$$ Let no one heed the tears of Drusus or my own sorrow ,  or any stories invented to our discredit
 Exim biduum criminibus obiciendis statuitur utque sex dierum spatio interiecto reus per triduum defenderetur$$ Two days were then assigned for the bringing forward of the charges ,  and after six days' interval ,  the prisoner's defence was to occupy three days
 tum Fulcinius vetera et inania orditur , ambitiose avareque habitam Hispaniam$$ Thereupon Fulcinius Trio began with some old and irrelevant accusations about intrigues and extortion during Piso's government of Spain
 quod neque convictum noxae reo si recentia purgaret , neque defensum absolutioni erat si teneretur maioribus flagitiis$$ This ,  if proved ,  would not have been fatal to the defendant ,  if he cleared himself as to his late conduct ,  and ,  if refuted ,  would not have secured his acquittal ,  if he were convicted of the greater crimes
 post quem Servaeus et Veranius et Vitellius consimili studio et multa eloquentia Vitellius obiecere odio Germanici et rerum novarum studio Pisonem vulgus militum per licentiam et sociorum iniurias eo usque conrupisse ut parens legionum a deterrimis appellaretur contra in optimum quemque , maxime in comites et amicos Germanici saevisse$$ Next ,  Servaeus ,  Veranius ,  and Vitellius ,  all with equal earnestness ,  Vitellius with striking eloquence ,  alleged against Piso that out of hatred of Germanicus and a desire of revolution he had so corrupted the common soldiers by licence and oppression of the allies that he was called by the vilest of them father of the legions while on the other hand to all the best men ,  especially to the companions and friends of Germanicus ,  he had been savagely cruel
 postremo ipsum devotionibus et veneno peremisse sacra hinc et immolationes nefandas ipsius atque Plancinae , peritam armis rem publicam , utque reus agi posset , acie victum$$ Lastly ,  he had ,  they said ,  destroyed Germanicus himself by sorceries and poison ,  and hence came those ceremonies and horrible sacrifices made by himself and Plancina then he had threatened the State with war ,  and had been defeated in battle ,  before he could be tried as a prisoner
 Defensio in ceteris trepidavit$$ On all points but one the defence broke down
 nam neque ambitionem militarem neque provinciam pessimo cuique obnoxiam , ne contumelias quidem adversum imperatorem infitiari poterat$$ That he had tampered with the soldiers ,  that his province had been at the mercy of the vilest of them ,  that he had even insulted his chief ,  he could not deny
 solum veneni crimen visus est diluisse , quod ne accusatores quidem satis firmabant , in convivio Germanici , cum super eum Piso discumberet , infectos manibus eius cibos arguentes$$ It was only the charge of poisoning from which he seemed to have cleared himself This indeed the prosecutors did not adequately sustain by merely alleging that at a banquet given by Germanicus ,  his food had been tainted with poison by the hands of Piso who sat next above him
 quippe absurdum videbatur inter aliena servitia et tot adstantium visu , ipso Germanico coram , id ausum$$ It seemed absurd to suppose that he would have dared such an attempt among strange servants ,  in the sight of so many bystanders ,  and under Germanicus's own eyes
 offerebatque familiam reus et ministros in tormenta flagitabat$$ And ,  besides ,  the defendant offered his slaves to the torture ,  and insisted on its application to the attendants on that occasion
 sed iudices per diversa implacabiles erant , Caesar ob bellum provinciae inlatum , senatus numquam satis credito sine fraude Germanicum interisse$$ But the judges for different reasons were merciless ,  the emperor ,  because war had been made on a province ,  the Senate because they could not be sufficiently convinced that there had been no treachery about the death of Germanicus
 * * scripsissent expostulantes , quod haud minus Tiberius quam Piso abnuere$$ At the same time shouts were heard from the people in front of the Senate House ,  threatening violence if he escaped the verdict of the Senators
 simul populi ante curiam voces audiebantur non temperaturos manibus si patrum sententias evasisset$$ They had actually dragged Piso's statues to the Gemonian stairs ,  and were breaking them in pieces ,  when by the emperor's order they were rescued and replaced
 effigiesque Pisonis traxerant in Gemonias ac divellebant , ni iussu principis protectae repositaeque forent$$ Piso was then put in a litter and attended by a tribune of one of the Praetorian cohorts ,  who followed him ,  so it was variously rumoured ,  to guard his person or to be his executioner
 Eadem Plancinae invidia , maior gratia$$ Plancina was equally detested ,  but had stronger interest
 eoque ambiguum habebatur quantum Caesari in eam liceret$$ Consequently it was considered a question how far the emperor would be allowed to go against her
 atque ipsa , donec mediae Pisoni spes , sociam se cuiuscumque fortunae et si ita ferret comitem exitii promittebat$$ While Piso's hopes were in suspense ,  she offered to share his lot ,  whatever it might be ,  and in the worst event ,  to be his companion in death
 ut secretis Augustae precibus veniam obtinuit , paulatim segregari a marito , dividere defensionem coepit$$ But as soon as she had secured her pardon through the secret intercessions of Augusta ,  she gradually withdrew from her husband and separated her defence from his
 quod reus postquam sibi exitiabile intellegit , an adhuc experiretur dubitans , hortantibus filiis durat mentem senatumque rursum ingreditur$$ When the prisoner saw that this was fatal to him ,  he hesitated whether he should still persist ,  but at the urgent request of his sons braced his courage and once more entered the Senate
 redintegratamque accusationem , infensas patrum voces , adversa et saeva cuncta perpessus , nullo magis exterritus est quam quod Tiberium sine miseratione , sine ira , obstinatum clausumque vidit , ne quo adfectu perrumperetur$$ There he bore patiently the renewal of the accusation ,  the furious voices of the Senators ,  savage opposition indeed from every quarter ,  but nothing daunted him so much as to see Tiberius ,  without pity and without anger ,  resolutely closing himself against any inroad of emotion
 relatus domum , tamquam defensionem in posterum meditaretur , pauca conscribit obsignatque et liberto tradit$$ He was conveyed back to his house ,  where ,  seemingly by way of preparing his defence for the next day ,  he wrote a few words ,  sealed the paper and handed it to a freedman
 tum solita curando corpori exequitur$$ Then he bestowed the usual attention on his person
 dein multam post noctem , egressa cubiculo uxore , operiri foris iussit et coepta luce perfosso iugulo , iacente humi gladio , repertus est$$ after a while ,  late at night ,  his wife having left his chamber ,  he ordered the doors to be closed ,  and at daybreak was found with his throat cut and a sword lying on the ground
 Audire me memini ex senioribus visum saepius inter manus Pisonis libellum quem ipse non vulgaverit sed amicos eius dictitavisse , litteras Tiberii et mandata in Germanicum contineri , ac destinatum promere apud patres principemque arguere , ni elusus a Seiano per vana promissa foret$$ I remember to have heard old men say that a document was often seen in Piso's hands ,  the substance of which he never himself divulged ,  but which his friends repeatedly declared contained a letter from Tiberius with instructions referring to Germanicus ,  and that it was his intention to produce it before the Senate and upbraid the emperor ,  had he not been deluded by vain promises from Sejanus
 nec illum sponte extinctum verum immisso percussore$$ Nor did he perish ,  they said ,  by his own hand ,  but by that of one sent to be his executioner
 quorum neutrum adseveraverim$$ Neither of these statements would I positively affirm
 neque tamen occulere debui narratum ab iis qui nostram ad iuventam duraverunt$$ still it would not have been right for me to conceal what was related by those who lived up to the time of my youth
 Caesar flexo in maestitiam ore suam invidiam tali morte quaesitam apud senatum      crebrisque interrogationibus exquirit qualem Piso diem supremum noctemque exegisset$$ The emperor ,  assuming an air of sadness ,  complained in the Senate that the purpose of such a death was to bring odium on himself ,  and he asked with repeated questionings how Piso had spent his last day and night
 atque illo pleraque sapienter quaedam inconsultius respondente , recitat codicillos a Pisone in hunc ferme modum compositos$$ Receiving answers which were mostly judicious ,  though in part somewhat incautious ,  he read out a note written by Piso ,  nearly to the following effect 
 conspiratione inimicorum et invidia falsi criminis oppressus , quatenus veritati et innocentiae meae nusquam locus est , deos inmortalis testor vixisse me , Caesar , cum fide adversum te neque alia in matrem tuam pietate$$ Crushed by a conspiracy of my foes and the odium excited by a lying charge ,  since my truth and innocence find no place here ,  I call the immortal gods to witness that towards you Caesar ,  I have lived loyally ,  and with like dutiful respect towards your mother
 vosque oro liberis meis consulatis , ex quibus Gnaeus Piso qualicumque fortunae meae non est adiunctus , cum omne hoc tempus in urbe egerit , Marcus Piso repetere Syriam dehortatus est$$ And I implore you to think of my children ,  one of whom ,  Cneius is in way implicated in my career ,  whatever it may have been ,  seeing that all this time he has been at Rome ,  while the other ,  Marcus Piso ,  dissuaded me from returning to Syria
 atque utinam ego potius filio iuveni quam ille patri seni cessisset$$ Would that I had yielded to my young son rather than he to his aged father! And therefore I pray the more earnestly that the innocent may not pay the penalty of my wickedness
 eo impensius precor ne meae pravitatis poenas innoxius luat per quinque et quadraginta annorum obsequium , per collegium consulatus quondam divo Augusto parenti tuo probatus et tibi amicus nec quicquam post haec rogaturus salutem infelicis filii rogo$$ By forty-five years of obedience ,  by my association with you in the consulate ,  as one who formerly won the esteem of the Divine Augustus ,  your father ,  as one who is your friend and will never hereafter ask a favour ,  I implore you to save my unhappy son
 de Plancina nihil addidit$$ About Plancina he added not a word
 Eodem anno Tacfarinas , quem priore aestate pulsum a Camillo memoravi , bellum in Africa renovat , vagis primum populationibus et ob pernicitatem inultis , dein vicos excindere , trahere gravis praedas$$ That same year Tacfarinas who had been defeated ,  as I have related ,  by Camillus in the previous summer ,  renewed hostilities in Africa ,  first by mere desultory raids ,  so swift as to be unpunished next ,  by destroying villages and carrying off plunder wholesale
 postremo haud procul Pagyda flumine cohortem Romanam circumsedit$$ Finally ,  he hemmed in a Roman cohort near the river Pagyda
 praeerat castello Decrius impiger manu , exercitus militia et illam obsidionem flagitii ratus$$ The position was commanded by Decrius ,  a soldier energetic in action and experienced in war ,  who regarded the siege as a disgrace
 is cohortatus milites , ut copiam pugnae in aperto faceret aciem pro castris instruit$$ Cheering on his men to offer battle in the open plain ,  he drew up his line in front of his intrenchments
 primoque impetu pulsa cohorte promptus inter tela occursat fugientibus , increpat signiferos quod inconditis aut desertoribus miles Romanus terga daret$$ At the first shock ,  the cohort was driven back ,  upon which he threw himself fearlessly amid the missiles in the path of the fugitives and cried shame on the standard-bearers for letting Roman soldiers show their backs to a rabble of deserters
 simul exceptat vulnera et quamquam transfosso oculo adversum os in hostem intendit neque proelium omisit donec desertus suis caderet$$ At the same moment he was covered with wounds ,  and though pierced through the eye ,  he resolutely faced the enemy and ceased not to fight till he fell deserted by his men
 Quae postquam Lucius Apronio (nam Camillo successerat) comperta , magis dedecore suorum quam gloria hostis anxius , raro ea tempestate et e vetere memoria facinore decumum quemque ignominiosae cohortis sorte ductos fusti necat$$ On receiving this information ,  Lucius Apronius ,  successor to Camillus ,  alarmed more by the dishonour of his own men than by the glory of the enemy ,  ventured on a deed quite exceptional at that time and derived from old tradition
 tantumque severitate profectum ut vexillum veteranorum , non amplius quingenti numero , easdem Tacfarinatis copias praesidium cui Thala nomen adgressas fuderint$$ He flogged to death every tenth man drawn by lot from the disgraced cohort So beneficial was this rigour that a detachment of veterans ,  numbering not more than five hundred ,  routed those same troops of Tacfarinas on their attacking a fortress named Thala
 quo proelio Rufus Helvius gregarius miles servati civis decus rettulit donatusque est ab Apronio torquibus et hasta$$ In this engagement Rufus Helvius ,  a common soldier ,  won the honour of saving a citizen's life ,  and was rewarded by Apronius with a neck-chain and a spear
 Caesar addidit civicam coronam , quod non eam quoque Apronius iure proconsulis tribuisset questus magis quam offensus$$ To these the emperor added the civic crown ,  complaining ,  but without anger ,  that Apronius had not used his right as proconsul to bestow this further distinction
 sed Tacfarinas perculsis Numidis et obsidia aspernantibus spargit bellum , ubi instaretur cedens ac rursum in terga remeans$$ Tacfarinas ,  however ,  finding that the Numidians were cowed and had a horror of siege-operations ,  pursued a desultory warfare ,  retreating when he was pressed ,  and then again hanging on his enemy's rear
 et dum ea ratio barbaro fuit , inritum fessumque Romanum impune ludificabatur$$ While the barbarian continued these tactics ,  he could safely insult the baffled and exhausted Romans
 postquam deflexit ad maritimos locos , inligatus praeda stativis castris adhaerebat , missu patris Apronius Caesianus cum equite et cohortibus auxiliariis , quis velocissimos legionum addiderat , prosperam adversum Numidas pugnam facit pellitque in deserta$$ But when he marched away towards the coast and ,  hampered with booty ,  fixed himself in a regular camp ,  Caesianus was despatched by his father Apronius with some cavalry and auxiliary infantry ,  reinforced by the most active of the legionaries ,  and ,  after a successful battle with the Numidians ,  drove them into the desert
 Inlustrium domuum adversa (etenim haud multum distanti tempore Calpurnii Pisonem , Aemilii Lepidam amiserant) solacio adfecit D$$ It was some compensation for the misfortunes of great houses (for within a short interval the Calpurnii had lost Piso and the Aemilii Lepida) that Decimus Silanus was now restored to the Junian family
 Silanus Iuniae familiae redditus$$ I will briefly relate his downfall
 casum eius paucis repetam ut valida divo Augusto in rem publicam fortuna ita domi improspera fuit ob impudicitiam filiae ac neptis quas urbe depulit , adulterosque earum morte aut fuga punivit$$ Though the Divine Augustus in his public life enjoyed unshaken prosperity ,  he was unfortunate at home from the profligacy of his daughter and granddaughter ,  both of whom he banished from Rome ,  and punished their paramours with death or exile
 nam culpam inter viros ac feminas vulgatam gravi nomine laesarum religionum ac violatae maiestatis appellando clementiam maiorum suasque ipse leges egrediebatur$$ Calling ,  as he did ,  a vice so habitual among men and women by the awful name of sacrilege and treason ,  he went far beyond the indulgent spirit of our ancestors ,  beyond indeed his own legislation

 D Silanus in nepti Augusti adulter , quamquam non ultra foret saevitum quam ut amicitia Caesaris Tiberio imperitante deprecari senatum ac principem ausus est Marcus Silani fratris potentia , qui per insignem nobilitatem et eloquentiam praecellebat$$ Decimus Silanus ,  the paramour of the granddaughter of Augustus ,  though the only severity he experienced was exclusion from the emperor's friendship ,  saw clearly that it meant exile and it was not till Tiberius's reign that he ventured to appeal to the Senate and to the prince ,  in reliance on the influence of his brother Marcus Silanus ,  who was conspicuous both for his distinguished rank and eloquence
 sed Tiberius gratis agenti Silano patribus coram respondit se quoque laetari quod frater eius e peregrinatione longinqua revertisset , idque iure licitum quia non senatus consulto non lege pulsus foret$$ But Tiberius ,  when Silanus thanked him ,  replied in the Senate's presence ,  that he too rejoiced at the brother's return from his long foreign tour ,  and that this was justly allowable ,  inasmuch as he had been banished not by a decree of the Senate or under any law
 sibi tamen adversus eum integras parentis sui offensiones neque reditu Silani dissoluta quae Augustus voluisset$$ Still ,  personally ,  he said ,  he felt towards him his father's resentment in all its force ,  and the return of Silanus had not cancelled the intentions of Augustus
 fuit posthac in urbe eque honores adeptus est$$ Silanus after this lived at Rome without attaining office

 ceterum multitudo periclitantium gliscebat , cum omnis domus delatorum interpretationibus subverteretur , utque antehac flagitiis ita tunc legibus laborabatur$$ Meanwhile there was an increase in the number of persons imperilled ,  for every household was undermined by the insinuations of informers and now the country suffered from its laws ,  as it had hitherto suffered from its vices
 ea res admonet ut de principiis iuris et quibus modis ad hanc multitudinem infinitam ac varietatem legum perventum sit altius disseram$$ This suggests to me a fuller discussion of the origin of law and of the methods by which we have arrived at the present endless multiplicity and variety of our statutes

 et terror omnibus intentabatur ni Tiberius statuendo remedio quinque consularium , quinque e praetoriis , totidem e cetero senatu sorte duxisset apud quos exsoluti plerique legis nexus modicum in praesens levamentum fuere$$ But this espionage became too searching ,  and Rome and Italy and Roman citizens everywhere fell into its clutches Many men's fortunes were ruined ,  and over all there hung a terror till Tiberius ,  to provide a remedy ,  selected by lot five ex-consuls ,  five ex-praetors ,  and five senators ,  by whom most of the legal knots were disentangled and some light temporary relief afforded
 Per idem tempus Neronem e liberis Germanici iam ingressum iuventam commendavit patribus , utque munere capessendi vigintiviratus solveretur et quinquennio maturius quam per leges quaesturam peteret non sine inrisu audientium postulavit$$ About this same time he commended to the Senate's favour ,  Nero ,  Germanicus's son ,  who was just entering on manhood ,  and asked them ,  not without smiles of ridicule from his audience ,  to exempt him from serving as one of the Twenty Commissioners ,  and let him be a candidate for quaestorship five years earlier than the law allowed
 praetendebat sibi atque fratri decreta eadem petente Augusto$$ His excuse was that a similar decree had been made for himself and his brother at the request of Augustus
 sed neque tum fuisse dubitaverim qui eius modi preces occulti inluderent ac tamen initia fastigii Caesaribus erant magisque in oculis vetus mos , et privignis cum vitrico levior necessitudo quam avo adversum nepotem$$ But I cannot doubt that even then there were some who secretly laughed at such a petition ,  though the Caesars were but in the beginning of their grandeur ,  and ancient usage was more constantly before men's eyes ,  while also the tie between stepfather and stepson was weaker than that between grandfather and grandchild
 additur pontificatus et quo primum die forum ingressus est congiarium plebi admodum laetae quod Germanici stirpem iam puberem aspiciebat$$ The pontificate was likewise conferred on Nero ,  and on the day on which he first entered the forum ,  a gratuity was given to the city-populace ,  who greatly rejoiced at seeing a son of Germanicus now grown to manhood

 suberat tamen vigor animi ingentibus negotiis par , eo acrior quo somnum et inertiam magis ostentabat$$ But beneath all this was a vigorous mind ,  equal to the greatest labours ,  the more active in proportion as he made a show of sloth and apathy
 igitur incolumi Maecenate proximus , mox praecipuus , cui secreta imperatorum inniterentur , et interficiendi Postumi Agrippae conscius , aetate provecta speciem magis in amicitia principis quam vim tenuit$$ And so while Maecenas lived ,  he stood next in favour to him ,  and was afterwards the chief depository of imperial secrets ,  and accessory to the murder of Postumus Agrippa ,  till in advanced age he retained the shadow rather than the substance of the emperor's friendship
 idque et Maecenati acciderat , fato potentiae raro sempiternae , an satias capit aut illos cum omnia tribuerunt aut hos cum iam nihil reliquum est quod cupiant$$ The same too had happened to Maecenas ,  so rarely is it the destiny of power to be lasting ,  or perhaps a sense of weariness steals over princes when they have bestowed everything ,  or over favourites ,  when there is nothing left them to desire
 Inter quae Severus Caecina censuit ne quem magistratum cui provincia obvenisset uxor comitaretur , multum ante repetito concordem sibi coniugem et sex partus enixam , seque quae in publicum statueret domi servavisse , cohibita intra Italiam , quamquam ipse pluris per provincias quadraginta stipendia explevisset$$ During this debate Severus Caecina proposed that no magistrate who had obtained a province should be accompanied by his wife He began by recounting at length how harmoniously he had lived with his wife ,  who had borne him six children ,  and how in his own home he had observed what he was proposing for the public ,  by having kept her in Italy ,  though he had himself served forty campaigns in various provinces

 optumus quisque rei publicae cura maerebat multi odio praesentium et cupidine mutationis suis quoque periculis laetabantur increpabantque Tiberium quod in tanto rerum motu libellis accusatorum insumeret operam$$ All good men were saddened by anxiety for the country ,  but many in their loathing of the present system and eagerness for change ,  rejoiced at their very perils and exclaimed against Tiberius for giving attention amid such political convulsions to the calumnies of informers
 an Sacrovirum maiestatis crimine reum in senatu fore$$ Was Sacrovir too ,  they asked ,  to be charged with treason before the Senate
 extitisse tandem viros qui cruentas epistulas armis cohiberent$$ We have at last found men to check those murderous missives by the sword
 miseram pacem vel bello bene mutari$$ Even war is a good exchange for a miserable peace
 tanto impensius in securitatem compositus , neque loco neque vultu mutato , sed ut solitum per illos dies egit , altitudine animi , an compererat modica esse et vulgatis leviora$$ Tiberius all the more studiously assumed an air of unconcern He changed neither his residence nor his look ,  but kept up his usual demeanour during the whole time ,  either from the profoundness of his reserve
 Interim Silius cum legionibus duabus incedens praemissa auxiliari manu vastat Sequanorum pagos qui finium extremi et Aeduis contermini sociique in armis erant$$ Silius meantime was advancing with two legions ,  and having sent forward some auxiliary troops was ravaging those villages of the Sequani ,  which ,  situated on the border ,  adjoin the Aedui ,  and were associated with them in arms
 mox Augustodunum petit propero agmine , certantibus inter se signiferis , fremente etiam gregario milite , ne suetam requiem , ne spatia noctium opperiretur$$ He then pushed on by forced marches to Augustodunum ,  his standard-bearers vying in zeal ,  and even the privates loudly protesting against any halt for their usual rest or during the hours of night

 id satis ad victoriam$$ that will be enough for victory
 duodecimum apud lapidem Sacrovir copiaeque patentibus locis apparuere$$ Twelve miles from Augustodunum they saw before them Sacrovir and his army in an open plain
 in fronte statuerat ferratos , in cornibus cohortis , a tergo semermos$$ His men in armour he had posted in the van ,  his light infantry on the wings ,  and the half-armed in the rear
 ipse inter primores equo insigni adire , memorare veteres Gallorum glorias quaeque Romanis adversa intulissent quam decora victoribus libertas , quanto intolerantior servitus iterum victis$$ He himself rode amid the foremost ranks on a splendid charger ,  reminding them of the ancient glories of the Gauls ,  of the disasters they had inflicted on the Romans ,  how grand would be the freedom of the victorious ,  how more intolerable than ever the slavery of a second conquest
 Non diu haec nec apud laetos$$ His words were brief and heard without exultation
 etenim propinquabat legionum acies , inconditique ac militiae nescii oppidani neque oculis neque auribus satis competebant$$ For now the legions in battle array were advancing ,  and the rabble of townsfolk who knew nothing of war had their faculties of sight and hearing quite paralysed
 contra Silius , etsi praesumpta spes hortandi causas exemerat , clamitabat tamen pudendum ipsis quod Germaniarum victores adversum Gallos tamquam in hostem ducerentur$$ Silius ,  on the one hand ,  though confident hope took away any need for encouragement ,  exclaimed again and again that it was a shame to the conquerors of Germany to have to be led against Gauls ,  as against an enemy
 una nuper cohors rebellem Turonum , una ala Trevirum , paucae huius ipsius exercitus turmae profligavere Sequanos$$ Only the other day the rebel Turoni had been discomfited by a single cohort ,  the Treveri by one cavalry squadron ,  the Sequani by a few companies of this very army
 quanto pecunia dites et voluptatibus opulentos tanto magis imbellis Aeduos evincite et fugientibus consulite$$ Prove to these Aedui once for all that the more they abound in wealth and luxury ,  the more unwarlike are they ,  but spare them when they flee

 paulum morae attulere ferrati , restantibus lamminis adversum pila et gladios$$ On the wings there was but a brief resistance
 set miles correptis securibus et dolabris , ut si murum perrumperet , caedere tegmina et corpora$$ The men in mail were somewhat of an obstacle ,  as the iron plates did not yield to javelins or swords
 quidam trudibus aut furcis inertem molem prosternere , iacentesque nullo ad resurgendum nisu quasi exanimes linquebantur$$ but our men ,  snatching up hatchets and pickaxes ,  hacked at their bodies and their armour as if they were battering a wall

 illic sua manu , reliqui mutuis ictibus occidere incensa super villa omnis cremavit$$ Sacrovir with his most trustworthy followers hurried first to Augustodunum and then ,  from fear of being surrendered ,  to an adjacent country house
 Sub idem tempus ut mors Sulpicii Quirini publicis exequiis frequentaretur petivit a senatu$$ About the same time he requested the Senate to let the death of Sulpicius Quirinus be celebrated with a public funeral
 nihil ad veterem et patriciam Sulpiciorum familiam Quirinius pertinuit , ortus apud municipium Lanuvium$$ With the old patrician family of the Sulpicii this Quirinus ,  who was born in the town of Lanuvium ,  was quite unconnected
 sed impiger militiae et acribus ministeriis consulatum sub divo Augusto , mox expugnatis per Ciliciam Homonadensium castellis insignia triumphi adeptus , datusque rector G$$ An indefatigable soldier ,  he had by his zealous services won the consulship under the Divine Augustus ,  and subsequently the honours of a triumph for having stormed some fortresses of the Homonadenses in Cilicia
 Caesari Armeniam optinenti Tiberium quoque Rhodi agentem coluerat$$ He was also appointed adviser to Caius Caesar in the government of Armenia ,  and had likewise paid court to Tiberius ,  who was then at Rhodes
 quod tunc patefecit in senatu , laudatis in se officiis et incusato Marcus Lollio , quem auctorem Gaio Caesari pravitatis et discordiarum arguebat$$ The emperor now made all this known to the Senate ,  and extolled the good offices of Quirinus to himself ,  while he censured Marcus Lollius ,  whom he charged with encouraging Caius Caesar in his perverse and quarrelsome behaviour
 sed ceteris haud laeta memoria Quirini erat ob intenta , ut memoravi , Lepidae pericula sordidamque et praepotentem senectam$$ But people generally had no pleasure in the memory of Quirinus ,  because of the perils he had brought ,  as I have related ,  on Lepida ,  and the meanness and dangerous power of his last years
 Fine anni Clutorium Priscum equitem Romanum , post celebre carmen quo Germanici suprema defleverat , pecunia donatum a Caesare , corripuit delator , obiectans aegro Druso composuisse quod , si extinctus foret , maiore praemio vulgaretur id Clutorius in domo Publius Petronii socru eius Vitellia coram multisque inlustribus feminis per vaniloquentiam legerat$$ At the close of the year ,  Caius Lutorius Priscus ,  a Roman knight ,  who ,  after writing a popular poem bewailing the death of Germanicus ,  had received a reward in money from the emperor ,  was fastened on by an informer ,  and charged with having composed another during the illness of Drusus ,  which ,  in the event of the prince's death ,  might be published with even greater profit to himself He had in his vanity read it in the house of Publius Petronius before Vitellia ,  Petronius's mother-in-law ,  and several ladies of rank
 ut delator extitit , ceteris ad dicendum testimonium exterritis , sola Vitellia nihil se audivisse adseveravit$$ As soon as the accuser appeared ,  all but Vitellia were frightened into giving evidence She alone swore that she had heard not a word
 sed arguentibus ad perniciem plus fidei fuit , sententiaque Haterii Agrippae consulis designati indictum reo ultimum supplicium$$ But those who criminated him fatally were rather believed ,  and on the motion of Haterius Agrippa ,  the consul-elect ,  the last penalty was invoked on the accused
 Contra M$$ Marcus Lepidus spoke against the sentence as follows 
 Lepidus in hunc modum exorsus est si , patres conscripti , unum id spectamus , quam nefaria voce Clutorius Priscus mentem suam et auris hominum polluerit , neque carcer neque laqueus , ne serviles quidem cruciatus in eum suffecerint$$  , Senators ,  if we look to the single fact of the infamous utterance with which Lutorius has polluted his own mind and the ears of the public ,  neither dungeon nor halter nor tortures fit for a slave would be punishment enough for him
 sin flagitia et facinora sine modo sunt , suppliciis ac remediis principis moderatio maiorumque et vestra exempla temperat et vana a scelestis , dicta a maleficiis differunt , est locus sententiae per quam neque huic delictum impune sit et nos clementiae simul ac severitatis non paeniteat$$ But though vice and wicked deeds have no limit ,  penalties and correctives are moderated by the clemency of the sovereign and by the precedents of your ancestors and yourselves Folly differs from wickedness evil words from evil deeds ,  and thus there is room for a sentence by which this offence may not go unpunished ,  while we shall have no cause to regret either leniency or severity
 saepe audivi principem nostrum conquerentem si quis sumpta morte misericordiam eius praevenisset$$ Often have I heard our emperor complain when any one has anticipated his mercy by a self-inflicted death
 vita Clutorii in integro est , qui neque servatus in periculum rei publicae neque interfectus in exemplum ibit$$ Lutorius's life is still safe if spared ,  he will be no danger to the State
 studia illi ut plena vaecordiae , ita inania et fluxa sunt$$ if put to death ,  he will be no warning to others
 nec quicquam grave ac serium ex eo metuas qui suorum ipse flagitiorum proditor non virorum animis sed muliercularum adrepit cedat tamen urbe et bonis amissis aqua et igni arceatur$$ His productions are as empty and ephemeral as they are replete with folly Nothing serious or alarming is to be apprehended from the man who is the betrayer of his own shame and works on the imaginations not of men but of silly women
 quod perinde censeo ac si lege maiestatis teneretur$$ However ,  let him leave Rome ,  lose his property ,  and be outlawed
 Solus Lepido Rubellius Blandus e consularibus adsensit$$ Only one of the ex-consuls ,  Rubellius Blandus ,  supported Lepidus
 ceteri sententiam Agrippae secuti , ductusque in carcerem Priscus ac statim exanimatus$$ The rest voted with Agrippa Priscus was dragged off to prison and instantly put to death
 id Tiberius solitis sibi ambagibus apud senatum incusavit , cum extolleret pietatem quamvis modicas principis iniurias acriter ulciscentium , deprecare tam praecipitis verborum poenas , laudaret Lepidum neque Agrippam argueret$$ Of this Tiberius complained to the Senate with his usual ambiguity ,  extolling their loyalty in so sharply avenging the very slightest insults to the sovereign ,  though he deprecated such hasty punishment of mere words ,  praising Lepidus and not censuring Agrippa
 igitur factum senatus consultum ne decreta patrum ante diem decimum ad aerarium deferrentur idque vitae spatium damnatis prorogaretur$$ So the Senate passed a resolution that their decrees should not be registered in the treasury till nine days had expired ,  and so much respite was to be given to condemned persons
 sed non senatui libertas ad paenitendum erat neque Tiberius interiectu temporis mitigabatur$$ Still the Senate had not liberty to alter their purpose ,  and lapse of time never softened Tiberius
 Gaius Sulpicius D$$ Caius Sulpicius and Didius Haterius were the next consuls
 Haterius consules sequuntur , inturbidus externis rebus annus , domi suspecta severitate adversum luxum qui immensum proruperat ad cuncta quis pecunia prodigitur$$ It was a year free from commotions abroad ,  while at home stringent legislation was apprehended against the luxury which had reached boundless excess in everything on which wealth is lavished
 sed alia sumptuum quamvis graviora dissimulatis plerumque pretiis occultabantur$$ Some expenses ,  though very serious ,  were generally kept secret by a concealment of the real prices
 ventris et ganeae paratus adsiduis sermonibus vulgati fecerant curam ne princeps antiquae parsimoniae durius adverteret$$ but the costly preparations for gluttony and dissipation were the theme of incessant talk ,  and had suggested a fear that a prince who clung to oldfashioned frugality would be too stern in his reforms
 nam incipiente Gaius Bibulo ceteri quoque aediles disseruerant , sperni sumptuariam legem vetitaque utensilium pretia augeri in dies nec mediocribus remediis sisti posse , et consulti patres integrum id negotium ad principem distulerant$$ In fact ,  when the aedile Caius Bibulus broached the topic ,  all his colleagues had pointed out that the sumptuary laws were disregarded ,  that prohibited prices for household articles were every day on the increase ,  and that moderate measures could not stop the evil
 sed Tiberius saepe apud se pensitato an coerceri tam profusae cupidines possent , num coercitio plus damni in rem publicam ferret , quam indecorum adtrectare quod non obtineret vel retentum ignominiam et infamiam virorum inlustrium posceret , postremo litteras ad senatum composuit quarum sententia in hunc modum fuit$$ The Senate on being consulted had ,  without handling the matter ,  referred it to the emperor Tiberius ,  after long considering whether such reckless tastes could be repressed ,  whether the repression of them would not be still more hurtful to the State ,  also ,  how undignified it would be to meddle with what he could not succeed in ,  or what ,  if effected ,  would necessitate the disgrace and infamy of men of distinction ,  at last addressed a letter to the Senate to the following purport 
 Ceteris forsitan in rebus , patres conscripti , magis expediat me coram interrogari et dicere quid e re publica censeam$$ Perhaps in any other matter ,  Senators ,  it would be more convenient that I should be consulted in your presence ,  and then state what I think to be for the public good
 in hac relatione subtrahi oculos meos melius fuit , ne , denotantibus vobis ora ac metum singulorum qui pudendi luxus arguerentur , ipse etiam viderem eos ac velut deprenderem$$ In this debate it was better that my eyes should not be on you ,  for while you were noting the anxious faces of individual senators charged with shameful luxury ,  I too myself might observe them and ,  as it were ,  detect them
 quod si mecum ante viri strenui , aediles , consilium habuissent , nescio an suasurus fuerim omittere potius praevalida et adulta vitia quam hoc adsequi , ut palam fieret quibus flagitiis impares essemus$$ Had those energetic men ,  our aediles ,  first taken counsel with me ,  I do not know whether I should not have advised them to let alone vices so strong and so matured ,  rather than merely attain the result of publishing what are the corruptions with which we cannot cope
 sed illi quidem officio functi sunt , ut ceteros quoque magistratus sua munia implere velim$$ They however have certainly done their duty ,  as I would wish all other officials likewise to fulfil their parts
 mihi autem neque honestum silere neque proloqui expeditum , quia non aedilis aut praetoris aut consulis partis sustineo$$ For myself ,  it is neither seemly to keep silence nor is it easy to speak my mind ,  as I do not hold the office of aedile ,  praetor ,  or consul
 maius aliquid et excelsius a principe postulatur et cum recte factorum sibi quisque gratiam trahant , unius invidia ab omnibus peccatur$$ Something greater and loftier is expected of a prince ,  and while everybody takes to himself the credit of right policy ,  one alone has to bear the odium of every person's failures
 quid enim primum prohibere et priscum ad morem recidere adgrediar$$ For what am I first to begin with restraining and cutting down to the old standard
 villarumne infinita spatia$$ The vast dimensions of country houses
 familiarum numerum et nationes$$ The number of slaves of every nationality
 argenti et auri pondus$$ The masses of silver and gold
 aeris tabularumque miracula$$ The marvels in bronze and painting
 promiscas viris et feminis vestis atque illa feminarum propria , quis lapidum causa pecuniae nostrae ad externas aut hostilis gentis transferuntur$$ The apparel worn indiscriminately by both sexes ,  or that peculiar luxury of women which ,  for the sake of jewels ,  diverts our wealth to strange or hostile nations
 Nec ignoro in conviviis et circulis incusari ista et modum posci$$ I am not unaware that people at entertainments and social gatherings condemn all this and demand some restriction
 set si quis legem sanciat , poenas indicat , idem illi civitatem verti , splendidissimo cuique exitium parari , neminem criminis expertem clamitabunt$$ But if a law were to be passed and a penalty imposed ,  those very same persons will cry out that the State is revolutionised ,  that ruin is plotted against all our most brilliant fashion ,  that not a citizen is safe from incrimination
 atqui ne corporis quidem morbos veteres et diu auctos nisi per dura et aspera coerceas corruptus simul et corruptor , aeger et flagrans animus haud levioribus remediis restinguendus est quam libidinibus ardescit$$ Yet as even bodily disorders of long standing and growth can be checked only by sharp and painful treatment ,  so the fever of a diseased mind ,  itself polluted and a pollution to others ,  can be quenched only by remedies as strong as the passions which inflame it
 tot a maioribus repertae leges , tot quas divus Augustus tulit , illae oblivione , hae , quod flagitiosius est , contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere$$ Of the many laws devised by our ancestors ,  of the many passed by the Divine Augustus ,  the first have been forgotten ,  while his (all the more to our disgrace) have become obsolete through contempt ,  and this has made luxury bolder than ever
 nam si velis quod nondum vetitum est , timeas ne vetere$$ The truth is ,  that when one craves something not yet forbidden ,  there is a fear that it may be forbidden
 at si prohibita impune transcenderis , neque metus ultra neque pudor est$$ but when people once transgress prohibitions with impunity ,  there is no longer any fear or any shame
 cur ergo olim parsimonia pollebat$$ Why then in old times was economy in the ascendant
 quia sibi quisque moderabatur , quia unius urbis cives eramus$$ Because every one practised self-control
 ne inritamenta quidem eadem intra Italiam dominantibus$$ because we were all members of one city
 externis victoriis aliena , civilibus etiam nostra consumere didicimus$$ Nor even afterwards had we the same temptations ,  while our dominion was confined to Italy
 quantulum istud est de quo aediles admonent! quam , si cetera respicias , in levi habendum! at hercule nemo refert quod Italia externae opis indiget , quod vita populi Romani per incerta maris et tempestatum cotidie volvitur$$ Victories over the foreigner taught us how to waste the substance of others victories over ourselves ,  how to squander our own What a paltry matter is this of which the aediles are reminding us! What a mere trifle if you look at everything else! No one represents to the Senate that Italy requires supplies from abroad ,  and that the very existence of the people of Rome is daily at the mercy of uncertain waves and storms
 ac nisi provinciarum copiae et dominis et servitiis et agris subvenerint , nostra nos scilicet nemora nostraeque villae tuebuntur$$ And unless masters ,  slaves ,  and estates have the resources of the provinces as their mainstay ,  our shrubberies ,  forsooth ,  and our country houses will have to support us
 hanc , patres conscripti , curam sustinet princeps$$ Such ,  Senators ,  are the anxieties which the prince has to sustain ,  and the neglect of them will be utter ruin to the State
 haec omissa funditus rem publicam trahet$$ The cure for other evils must be sought in our own hearts
 reliquis intra animum medendum est$$ Let us be led to amendment ,  the poor by constraint ,  the rich by satiety
 nos pudor , pauperes necessitas , divites satias in melius mutet$$ Or if any of our officials give promise of such energy and strictness as can stem the corruption ,  I praise the man ,  and I confess that I am relieved of a portion of my burdens
 aut si quis ex magistratibus tantam industriam ac severitatem pollicetur ut ire obviam queat , hunc ego et laudo et exonerari laborum meorum partem fateor sin accusare vitia volunt , dein , cum gloriam eius rei adepti sunt , simultates faciunt ac mihi relinquunt , credite , patres conscripti , me quoque non esse offensionum avidum$$ But if they wish to denounce vice ,  and when they have gained credit for so doing they arouse resentments and leave them to me ,  be assured ,  Senators ,  that I too am by no means eager to incur enmities ,  and though for the public good I encounter formidable and often unjust enmities ,  yet I have a right to decline such as are unmeaning and purposeless and will be of use neither to myself nor to you
 Auditis Caesaris litteris remissa aedilibus talis cura luxusque mensae a fine Actiaci belli ad ea arma quis Servius Galba rerum adeptus est per annos centum profusis sumptibus exerciti paulatim exolevere$$ When they had heard the emperor's letter ,  the aediles were excused from so anxious a task ,  and that luxury of the table which from the close of the war ended at Actium to the armed revolution in which Servius Galba rose to empire ,  had been practised with profuse expenditure ,  gradually went out of fashion
 causas eius mutationis quaerere libet$$ It is as well that I should trace the causes of this change
 dites olim familiae nobilium aut claritudine insignes studio magnificentiae prolabebantur$$ Formerly rich or highly distinguished noble families often sank into ruin from a passion for splendour
 nam etiam tum plebem socios regna colere et coli licitum ut quisque opibus domo paratu speciosus per nomen et clientelas inlustrior habebatur postquam caedibus saevitum et magnitudo famae exitio erat , ceteri ad sapientiora convertere$$ Even then men were still at liberty to court and be courted by the city populace ,  by our allies and by foreign princes ,  and every one who from his wealth ,  his mansion and his establishment was conspicuously grand ,  gained too proportionate lustre by his name and his numerous clientele
 simul novi homines e municipiis et coloniis atque etiam provinciis in senatum crebro adsumpti domesticam parsimoniam intulerunt , et quamquam fortuna vel industria plerique pecuniosam ad senectam pervenirent , mansit tamen prior animus$$ After the savage massacres in which greatness of renown was fatal ,  the survivors turned to wiser ways The new men who were often admitted into the Senate from the towns ,  colonies and even the provinces ,  introduced their household thrift ,  and though many of them by good luck or energy attained an old age of wealth ,  still their former tastes remained
 sed praecipuus adstricti moris auctor Vespasianus fuit , antiquo ipse cultu victuque$$ But the chief encourager of strict manners was Vespasian ,  himself old-fashioned both in his dress and diet
 obsequium inde in principem et aemulandi amor validior quam poena ex legibus et metus$$ Henceforth a respectful feeling towards the prince and a love of emulation proved more efficacious than legal penalties or terrors
 nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis , ut quem ad modum temporum vices ita morum vertantur$$ Or possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle ,  and there may be moral revolutions just as there are changes of seasons
 nec omnia apud priores meliora , sed nostra quoque aetas multa laudis et artium imitanda posteris tulit$$ Nor was everything better in the past ,  but our own age too has produced many specimens of excellence and culture for posterity to imitate
 verum haec nobis in maiores certamina ex honesto maneant$$ May we still keep up with our ancestors a rivalry in all that is honourable!
 Inter quae provincia Africa Iunio Blaeso prorogata , Servius Maluginensis flamen Dialis ut Asiam sorte haberet postulavit , frustra vulgatum dictitans non licere Dialibus egredi Italia neque aliud ius suum quam Martialium Quirinaliumque flaminum$$ Meantime Junius Blaesus received an extension of his government of Africa ,  and Servius Maluginensis ,  the priest of Jupiter ,  demanded to have Asia allotted to him It was ,  he asserted ,  a popular error that it was not lawful for the priests of Jupiter to leave Italy in fact ,  his own legal position differed not from that of the priests of Mars and of Quirinus
 porro , si hi duxissent provincias , cur Dialibus id vetitum$$ If these latter had provinces allotted to them ,  why was it forbidden to the priests of Jupiter
 nulla de eo populi scita , non in libris caerimoniarum reperiri$$ There were no resolutions of the people or anything to be found in the books of ceremonies on the subject
 saepe pontifices Dialia sacra fecisse si flamen valetudine aut munere publico impediretur$$ Pontiffs had often performed the rites to Jupiter when his priest was hindered by illness or by public duty
 quinque et septuaginta annis post Cornelii Merulae caedem neminem suffectum neque tamen cessavisse religiones$$ For seventy-five years after the suicide of Cornelius Merula no successor to his office had been appointed
 quod si per tot annos possit non creari nullo sacrorum damno , quanto facilius afuturum ad unius anni proconsulare imperium$$ yet religious rites had not ceased If during so many years it was possible for there to be no appointment without any prejudice to religion ,  with what comparative ease might he be absent for one year's proconsulate
 privatis olim simultatibus effectum ut a pontificibus maximis ire in provincias prohiberentur$$ That these priests in former days were prohibited by the pontiff from going into the provinces ,  was the result of private feuds
 nunc deum munere summum pontificum etiam summum hominum esse , non aemulationi , non odio aut privatis adfectionibus obnoxium$$ Now ,  thank heaven ,  the supreme pontiff was also the supreme man ,  and was influenced by no rivalry ,  hatred or personal feeling
 Adversus quae cum augur Lentulus aliique varie dissererent , eo decursum est ut pontificis maximi sententiam opperirentur$$ As the augur Lentulus and others argued on various grounds against this view ,  the result was that they awaited the decision of the supreme pontiff
 Tiberius dilata notione de iure flaminis decretas ob tribuniciam Drusi potestatem caerimonias temperavit , nominatim arguens insolentiam sententiae aureasque litteras contra patrium morem$$ Tiberius deferred any investigation into the priest's legal position ,  but he modified the ceremonies which had been decreed in honour of Drusus's tribunitian power with special censure on the extravagance of the proposed inscription in gold ,  so contrary to national usage
 recitatae et Drusi epistulae quamquam ad modestiam flexae pro superbissimis accipiuntur$$ Letters also from Drusus were read ,  which ,  though studiously modest in expression ,  were taken to be extremely supercilious
 huc decidisse cuncta ut ne iuvenis quidem tanto honore accepto adiret urbis deos , ingrederetur senatum , auspicia saltem gentile apud solum inciperet$$ We have fallen so low ,  people said ,  that even a mere youth who has received so high an honour does not go as a worshipper to the city's gods ,  does not enter the Senate ,  does not so much as take the auspices on his country's soil
 bellum scilicet aut diverso terrarum distineri , litora et lacus Campaniae cum maxime peragrantem$$ There is a war ,  forsooth ,  or he is kept from us in some remote part of the world
 sic imbui rectorem generis humani , id primum e paternis consiliis discere$$ Why ,  at this very moment ,  he is on a tour amid the shores and lakes of Campania
 sane gravaretur aspectum civium senex imperator fessamque aetatem et actos labores praetenderet$$ Such is the training of the future ruler of mankind such the lesson he first learns from his father's counsels
 Druso quod nisi ex adrogantia impedimentum$$ An aged emperor may indeed shrink from the citizen's gaze ,  and plead the weariness of declining years and the toils of the past
 Sed Tiberius , vim principatus sibi firmans , imaginem antiquitatis senatui praebebat postulata provinciarum ad disquisitionem patrum mittendo$$ Tiberius meantime ,  while securing to himself the substance of imperial power ,  allowed the Senate some shadow of its old constitution by referring to its investigation certain demands of the provinces

 complebantur templa pessimis servitiorum$$ Temples were thronged with the vilest of the slaves
 eodem subsidio obaerati adversum creditores suspectique capitalium criminum receptabantur , nec ullum satis validum imperium erat coercendis seditionibus populi flagitia hominum ut caerimonias deum protegentis$$ the same refuge screened the debtor against his creditor ,  as well as men suspected of capital offences No authority was strong enough to check the turbulence of a people which protected the crimes of men as much as the worship of the gods
 igitur placitum ut mitterent civitates iura atque legatos$$ It was accordingly decided that the different states were to send their charters and envoys to Rome
 et quaedam quod falso usurpaverant sponte omisere$$ Some voluntarily relinquished privileges which they had groundlessly usurped
 multae vetustis superstitionibus aut meritis in populum Romanum fidebant$$ many trusted to old superstitions ,  or to their services to the Roman people
 magnaque eius diei species fuit quo senatus maiorum beneficia , sociorum pacta , regum etiam qui ante vim Romanam valuerant decreta ipsorumque numinum religiones introspexit , libero , ut quondam , quid firmaret mutaretve$$ It was a grand spectacle on that day ,  when the Senate examined grants made by our ancestors ,  treaties with allies ,  even decrees of kings who had flourished before Rome's ascendancy ,  and the forms of worship of the very deities ,  with full liberty as in former days ,  to ratify or to alter
 Primi omnium Ephesii adiere , memorantes non , ut vulgus crederet , Dianam atque Apollinem Delo genitos$$ First of all came the people of Ephesus They declared that Diana and Apollo were not born at Delos ,  as was the vulgar belief
 esse apud se Cenchreum amnem , lucum Ortygiam , ubi Latonam partu gravidam et oleae , quae tum etiam maneat , adnisam edidisse ea numina , deorumque monitu sacratum nemus , atque ipsum illic Apollinem post interfectos Cyclopas Iovis iram vitavisse$$ They had in their own country a river Cenchrius ,  a grove Ortygia ,  where Latona ,  as she leaned in the pangs of labour on an olive still standing ,  gave birth to those two deities ,  whereupon the grove at the divine intimation was consecrated There Apollo himself ,  after the slaughter of the Cyclops ,  shunned the wrath of Jupiter
 mox Liberum patrem , bello victorem , supplicibus Amazonum quae aram insiderant ignovisse$$ there too father Bacchus ,  when victorious in war ,  pardoned the suppliant Amazons who had gathered round the shrine
 auctam hinc concessu Herculis , cum Lydia poteretur , caerimoniam templo neque Persarum dicione deminutum ius$$ Subsequently by the permission of Hercules ,  when he was subduing Lydia ,  the grandeur of the temple's ceremonial was augmented ,  and during the Persian rule its privileges were not curtailed
 post Macedonas , dein nos servavisse$$ They had afterwards been maintained by the Macedonians ,  then by ourselves
 Proximi hos Magnetes Lucius Scipionis et Lucius Sullae constitutis nitebantur , quorum ille Antiocho , hic Mithridate pulsis fidem atque virtutem Magnetum decoravere , uti Dianae Leucophrynae perfugium inviolabile foret$$ Next the people of Magnesia relied on arrangements made by Lucius Scipio and Lucius Sulla These generals ,  after respectively defeating Antiochus and Mithridates ,  honoured the fidelity and courage of the Magnesians by allowing the temple of Diana of the White Brow to be an inviolable sanctuary
 Aphrodisienses posthac et Strationicenses dictatoris Caesaris ob vetusta in partis merita et recens divi Augusti decretum adtulere , laudati quod Parthorum inruptionem nihil mutata in populum Romanum constantia pertulissent$$ Then the people of Aphrodisia produced a decree of the dictator Caesar for their old services to his party ,  and those of Stratonicea ,  one lately passed by the Divine Augustus ,  in which they were commended for having endured the Parthian invasion without wavering in their loyalty to the Roman people
 sed Aphrodisiensium civitas Veneris , Stratonicensium Iovis et Triviae religionem tuebantur$$ Aphrodisia maintained the worship of Venus Stratonicea ,  that of Jupiter and of Diana of the Cross Ways
 altius Hierocaesarienses exposuere , Persicam apud se Dianam , delubrum rege Cyro dicatum$$ Hierocaesarea went back to a higher antiquity ,  and spoke of having a Persian Diana ,  whose fane was consecrated in the reign of Cyrus
 et memorabantur Perpennae , Isaurici multaque alia imperatorum nomina qui non modo templo sed duobus milibus passuum eandem sanctitatem tribuerant$$ They quoted too the names of Perperna ,  Isauricus ,  and many other generals who had conceded the same sacred character not only to the temple but to its precincts for two miles
 exim Cyprii tribus de delubris , quorum vetustissimum Paphiae Veneri auctor Aesrias , post filius eius Amathus Veneri Amathusiae et Iovi Salaminio Teucer , Telamonis patris ira profugus , posuissent$$ Then came the Cyprians on behalf of three shrines ,  the oldest of which had been set up by their founder Aerias to the Paphian Venus ,  the second by his son Amathus to Venus of Amathus ,  and the last to Jupiter of Salamis ,  by Teucer when he fled from the wrath of his father Telamon
 Auditae aliarum quoque civitatium legationem$$ Audience was also given to embassies from other states
 quorum copia fessi patres , et quia studiis certabatur , consulibus permisere ut perspecto iure , et si qua iniquitas involveretur , rem integram rursum ad senatum referrent$$ The senators wearied by their multiplicity and seeing the party spirit that was being roused ,  intrusted the inquiry to the consuls ,  who were to sift each title and see if it involved any abuse ,  and then refer back the entire matter to the Senate
 consules super eas civitates quas memoravi apud Pergamum Aesculapii compertum asylum rettulerunt ceteros obscuris ob vetustatem initiis niti$$ Besides the states already mentioned ,  the consuls reported that they had ascertained that at Pergamus there was a sanctuary of Aesculapius ,  but that the rest relied on an origin lost in the obscurity of antiquity
 nam Zmyrnaeos oraculum Apollinis , cuius imperio Stratonicidi Veneri templum dicaverint , Tenios eiusdem carmen referre , quo sacrare Neptuni effigiem aedemque iussi sint$$ For example ,  the people of Smyrna quoted an oracle of Apollo ,  which had commanded them to dedicate a temple to Venus Stratonicis and the islanders of Tenos ,  an utterance from the same deity ,  bidding them consecrate a statue and a fane to Neptune
 propiora Sardianos$$ Sardis preferred a more modern claim ,  a grant from the victorious Alexander

 set cultus numinum utrisque Dianam aut Apollinem venerandi$$ The Cretans too demanded a like privilege for a statue of the Divine Augustus
 petere et Cretenses simulacro divi Augusti factaque senatus consulta quis multo cum honore modus tamen praescribebatur iussique ipsis in templis figere aera sacrandam ad memoriam , neu specie religionis in ambitionem delaberentur$$ Decrees of the Senate were passed ,  which though very respectful ,  still prescribed certain limits ,  and the petitioners were directed to set up bronze tablets in each temple ,  to be a sacred memorial and to restrain them from sinking into selfish aims under the mask of religion
 Exequi sententias haud institui nisi insignis per honestum aut notabili dedecore , quod praecipuum munus annalium reor ne virtutes sileantur utque pravis dictis factisque ex posteritate et infamia metus sit ceterum tempora illa adeo infecta et adulatione sordida fuere ut non modo primores civitatis , quibus claritudo sua obsequiis protegenda erat , sed omnes consulares , magna pars eorum qui praetura functi multique etiam pedarii senatores certatim exsurgerent foedaque et nimia censerent$$ My purpose is not to relate at length every motion ,  but only such as were conspicuous for excellence or notorious for infamy This I regard as history's highest function ,  to let no worthy action be uncommemorated ,  and to hold out the reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and deeds So corrupted indeed and debased was that age by sycophancy that not only the foremost citizens who were forced to save their grandeur by servility ,  but every exconsul ,  most of the ex-praetors and a host of inferior senators would rise in eager rivalry to propose shameful and preposterous motions
 memoriae proditur Tiberium , quoties curia egrederetur , Graecis verbis in hunc modum eloqui solitum o homines ad servitutem paratos! scilicet etiam illum qui libertatem publicam nollet tam proiectae servientium patientiae taedebat$$ Tradition says that Tiberius as often as he left the Senate-House used to exclaim in Greek ,  How ready these men are to be slaves Clearly ,  even he ,  with his dislike of public freedom ,  was disgusted at the abject abasement of his creatures
 Paulatim dehinc ab indecoris ad infesta transgrediebantur$$ From unseemly flatteries they passed by degrees to savage acts
 Gaius Silanum pro consule Asiae repetundarum a sociis postulatum Mamercus Scaurus e consularibus , Iunius Otho praetor , Bruttedius Niger aedilis simul corripiunt obiectantque violatum Augusti numen , spretam Tiberii maiestatem , Mamercus antiqua exempla iaciens , Lucius Cottam a Scipione Africano , Servium Galbam a Catone censorio , Publius Rutilium a Marcus Scauro accusatos$$ Caius Silanus ,  pro-consul of Asia ,  was accused by our allies of extortion whereupon Mamercus Scaurus ,  an ex-consul ,  Junius Otho ,  a praetor ,  Brutidius Niger ,  an aedile ,  simultaneously fastened on him and charged him with sacrilege to the divinity of Augustus ,  and contempt of the majesty of Tiberius ,  while Mamercus Scaurus quoted old precedents ,  the prosecutions of Lucius Cotta by Scipio Africanus ,  of Servius Galba by Cato the Censor and of Publius Rutilius by Scaurus
 videlicet Scipio et Cato talia ulciscebantur aut ille Scaurus , quem proavum suum obprobrium maiorum Mamercus infami opera dehonestabat$$ As if indeed Scipio's and Cato's vengeance fell on such offences ,  or that of the famous Scaurus ,  whom his great grandson ,  a blot on his ancestry ,  this Mamercus was now disgracing by his infamous occupation
 Iunio Othoni litterarium ludum exercere vetus ars fuit$$ Junius Otho's old employment had been the keeping of a preparatory school
 mox Seiani potentia senator obscura initia impudentibus ausis propolluebat$$ Subsequently ,  becoming a senator by the influence of Sejanus ,  he shamed his origin ,  low as it was ,  by his unblushing effronteries
 Bruttedium artibus honestis copiosum et , si rectum iter pergeret , ad clarissima quaeque iturum festinatio extimulabat , dum aequalis , dein superiores , postremo suasmet ipse spes antire parat$$ Brutidius who was rich in excellent accomplishments ,  and was sure ,  had he pursued a path of virtue ,  to reach the most brilliant distinction ,  was goaded on by an eager impatience ,  while he strove to outstrip his equals ,  then his superiors ,  and at last even his own aspirations
 quod multos etiam bonos pessum dedit , qui spretis quae tarda cum securitate praematura vel cum exitio properant$$ Many have thus perished ,  even good men ,  despising slow and safe success and hurrying on even at the cost of ruin to premature greatness
 Auxere numerum accusatorum Gellius Publicola et Paconius , ille quaestor Silani , hic legatus$$ Gellius Publicola and Marcus Paconius ,  respectively quaestor and lieutenant of Silanus ,  swelled the number of the accusers
 nec dubium habebatur saevitiae captarumque pecuniarum teneri reum sed multa adgerebantur etiam insontibus periculosa , cum super tot senatores adversos facundissimis totius Asiae eoque ad accusandum delectis responderet solus et orandi nescius , proprio in metu qui exercitam quoque eloquentiam debilitat , non temperante Tiberio quin premeret voce vultu , eo quod ipse creberrime interrogabat , neque refellere aut eludere dabatur , ac saepe etiam confitendum erat ne frustra quaesivisset servos quoque Silani ut tormentis interrogarentur actor publicus mancipio acceperat$$ No doubt was felt as to the defendant's conviction for oppression and extortion ,  but there was a combination against him ,  that must have been perilous even to an innocent man Besides a host of adverse Senators there were the most accomplished orators of all Asia ,  who ,  as such ,  had been retained for the prosecution ,  and to these he had to reply alone ,  without any experience in pleading ,  and under that personal apprehension which is enough to paralyse even the most practised eloquence For Tiberius did not refrain from pressing him with angry voice and look ,  himself putting incessant questions ,  without allowing him to rebut or evade them ,  and he had often even to make admissions ,  that the questions might not have been asked in vain
 et ne quis necessariorum iuvaret periclitantem maiestatis crimina subdebantur , vinclum et necessitas silendi$$ His slaves too were sold by auction to the state-agent ,  to be examined by torture And that not a friend might help him in his danger ,  charges of treason were added ,  a binding guarantee for sealed lips
 igitur petito paucorum dierum interiectu defensionem sui deseruit , ausis ad Caesarem codicillis quibus invidiam et preces miscuerat$$ Accordingly he begged a few days' respite ,  and at last abandoned his defence ,  after venturing on a memorial to the emperor ,  in which he mingled reproach and entreaty
 At Cornelius Dolabella dum adulationem longius sequitur increpitis Gaius Silani moribus addidit ne quis vita probrosus et opertus infamia provinciam sortiretur , idque princeps diiudicaret$$ Cornelius Dolabella however ,  by way of carrying flattery yet further ,  sharply censured the morals of Silanus ,  and then moved that no one of disgraceful life and notorious infamy should be eligible for a province ,  and that of this the emperor should be judge
 nam a legibus delicta puniri$$ Laws ,  indeed ,  he said ,  punish crimes committed
 quanto fore mitius in ipsos , melius in socios , provideri ne peccaretur$$ but how much more merciful would it be to individuals ,  how much better for our allies ,  to provide against their commission
 adversum quae disseruit Caesar$$ The emperor opposed the motion
 non quidem sibi ignare quae de Silano vulgabantur , sed non ex rumore statuendum$$ Although ,  he said ,  I am not ignorant of the reports about Silanus ,  still we must decide nothing by hearsay
 multos in provinciis contra quam spes aut metus de illis fuerit egisse$$ Many a man has behaved in a province quite otherwise than was hoped or feared of him
 excitari quosdam ad meliora magnitudine rerum , hebescere alios$$ Some are roused to higher things by great responsibility
 neque posse principem sua scientia cuncta complecti neque expedire ut ambitione aliena trahatur$$ others are paralysed by it It is not possible for a prince's knowledge to embrace everything ,  and it is not expedient that he should be exposed to the ambitious schemings of others
 ideo leges in facta constitui quia futura in incerto sint$$ Laws are ordained to meet facts ,  inasmuch as the future is uncertain
 sic a maioribus institutum ut , si antissent delicta , poenae sequerentur$$ It was the rule of our ancestors that ,  whenever there was first an offence ,  some penalty should follow

 minui iura quotiens gliscat potestas , nec utendum imperio ubi legibus agi possit$$ Rights are invariably abridged ,  as despotism increases
 quanto rarior apud Tiberium popularitas tanto laetioribus animis accepta$$ nor ought we to fall back on imperial authority ,  when we can have recourse to the laws
 atque ille prudens moderandi , si propria ira non impelleretur , addidit insulam Gyarum immitem et sine cultu hominum esse$$ Such constitutional sentiments were so rare with Tiberius ,  that they were welcomed with all the heartier joy
 darent Iuniae familiae et viro quondam ordinis eiusdem ut Cythnum potius concederet id sororem quoque Silani Torquatam , priscae sanctimoniae virginem , expetere$$ Knowing ,  as he did ,  how to be forbearing ,  when he was not under the stimulus of personal resentment ,  he further said that Gyarus was a dreary and uninhabited island ,  and that ,  as a concession to the Junian family and to a man of the same order as themselves ,  they might let him retire by preference to Cythnus
 in hanc sententiam facta discessio$$ This ,  he added ,  was also the request of Torquata ,  Silanus's sister ,  a vestal of primitive purity
 Isdem diebus Lepidus ab senatu petivit ut basilicam Pauli , Aemilia monimenta , propria pecunia firmaret ornaretque$$ About the same time Lepidus asked the Senate's leave to restore and embellish ,  at his own expense ,  the basilica of Paulus ,  that monument of the Aemilian family
 erat etiam tum in more publica munificentia nec Augustus arcuerat Taurum , Philippum , Balbum hostilis exuvias aut exundantis opes ornatum ad urbis et posterum gloriam conferre$$ Public-spirited munificence was still in fashion ,  and Augustus had not hindered Taurus ,  Philippus ,  or Balbus from applying the spoils of war or their superfluous wealth to adorn the capital and to win the admiration of posterity
 quo tum exemplo Lepidus , quamquam pecuniae modicus , avitum decus recoluit$$ Following these examples ,  Lepidus ,  though possessed of a moderate fortune ,  now revived the glory of his ancestors
 at Pompei theatrum igne fortuito haustum Caesar extructurum pollicitus est eo quod nemo e familia restaurando sufficeret , manente tamen nomine Pompei$$ Pompeius's theatre ,  which had been destroyed by an accidental fire ,  the emperor promised to rebuild ,  simply because no member of the family was equal to restoring it ,  but Pompeius's name was to be retained
 simul laudibus Seianum extulit tamquam labore vigilantiaque eius tanta vis unum intra damnum stetisset$$ At the same time he highly extolled Sejanus on the ground that it was through his exertions and vigilance that such fury of the flames had been confined to the destruction of a single building
 et censuere patres effigiem Seiano quae apud theatrum Pompei locaretur$$ The Senate voted Sejanus a statue ,  which was to be placed in Pompeius's theatre
 neque multo post Caesar , cum Iunium Blaesum pro consule Africae triumphi insignibus attolleret , dare id se dixit honori Seiani , cuius ille avunculus erat$$ And soon afterwards the emperor in honouring Junius Blaesus proconsul of Africa ,  with triumphal distinctions ,  said that he granted them as a compliment to Sejanus ,  whose uncle Blaesus was
 Nam Tacfarinas , quamquam saepius depulsus , reparatis per intima Africae auxiliis huc adrogantiae venerat ut legatos ad Tiberium mitteret sedemque ultro sibi atque exercitui suo postularet aut bellum inexplicabile minitaretur$$ Still the career of Blaesus merited such a reward For Tacfarinas ,  though often driven back ,  had recruited his resources in the interior of Africa ,  and had become so insolent as to send envoys to Tiberius ,  actually demanding a settlement for himself and his army ,  or else threatening us with an interminable war
 non alias magis sua populique Romani contumelia indoluisse Caesarem ferunt quam quod desertor et praedo hostium more ageret$$ Never ,  it is said ,  was the emperor so exasperated by an insult to himself and the Roman people as by a deserter and brigand assuming the character of a belligerent
 ne Spartaco quidem post tot consularium exercituum cladis inultam Italiam urenti , quamquam Sertorii atque Mithridatis ingentibus bellis labaret res publica , datum ut pacto in fidem acciperetur$$ Even Spartacus when he had destroyed so many consular armies and was burning Italy with impunity ,  though the State was staggering under the tremendous wars of Sertorius and Mithridates ,  had not the offer of an honourable surrender on stipulated conditions
 nedum pulcherrimo populi Romani fastigio latro Tacfarinas pace et concessione agrorum redimeretur$$ far less ,  in Rome's most glorious height of power ,  should a robber like Tacfarinas be bought off by peace and concessions of territory
 dat negotium Blaeso ceteros quidem ad spem proliceret arma sine noxa ponendi , ipsius autem ducis quoquo modo poteretur$$ He intrusted the affair to Blaesus ,  who was to hold out to the other rebels the prospect of laying down their arms without hurt to themselves ,  while he was by any means to secure the person of the chief
 et recepti ea venia plerique$$ Many surrendered themselves on the strength of this amnesty
 mox adversum artes Tacfarinatis haud dissimili modo belligeratum$$ Before long the tactics of Tacfarinas were encountered in a similar fashion
 Nam quia ille robore exercitus impar , furandi melior , pluris per globos incursaret eluderetque et insidias simul temptaret , tres incessus , totidem agmina parantur$$ Unequal to us in solid military strength ,  but better in a war of surprises ,  he would attack ,  would elude pursuit ,  and still arrange ambuscades with a multitude of detachments
 ex quis Cornelius Scipio legatus praefuit qua praedatio in Leptitanos et suffugia Garamantum$$ And so we prepared three expeditions and as many columns
 alio latere , ne Cirtensium pagi impune traherentur , propriam manum Blaesus filius duxit$$ One of the three under the command of Cornelius Scipio ,  Blaesus's lieutenant ,  was to stop the enemy's forays on the Leptitani and his retreat to the Garamantes
 medio cum delectis , castella et munitiones idoneis locis imponens , dux ipse arta et infensa hostibus cuncta fecerat , quia , quoquo inclinarent , pars aliqua militis Romani in ore , in latere et saepe a tergo erat multique eo modo caesi aut circumventi tunc tripertitum exercitum pluris in manus dispergit praeponitque centuriones virtutis expertae$$ In another quarter ,  Blaesus's son led a separate force of his own ,  to save the villages of Cirta from being ravaged with impunity Between the two was the general himself with some picked troops By establishing redoubts and fortified lines in commanding positions ,  he had rendered the whole country embarrassing and perilous to the foe ,  for ,  whichever way he turned ,  a body of Roman soldiers was in his face ,  or on his flank ,  or frequently in the rear
 nec , ut mos fuerat , acta aestate retrahit copias aut in hibernaculis veteris provinciae componit , sed ut in limine belli dispositis castellis per expeditos et solitudinum gnaros mutantem mapalia Tacfarinatem proturbabat , donec fratre eius capto regressus est , properantius tamen quam ex utilitate sociorum , relictis per quos resurgeret bellum sed Tiberius pro confecto interpretatus id quoque Blaeso tribuit ut imperator a legionibus salutaretur , prisco erga duces honore qui bene gesta re publica gaudio et impetu victoris exercitus conclamabantur erantque plures simul imperatores nec super ceterorum aequalitatem$$ Many were thus slain or surprised Blaesus then further divided his triple army into several detachments under the command of centurions of tried valour At the end of the summer he did not ,  as was usual ,  withdraw his troops and let them rest in winter-quarters in the old province but ,  forming a chain of forts ,  as though he were on the threshold of a campaign ,  he drove Tacfarinas by flying columns well acquainted with the desert ,  from one set of huts to another ,  till he captured the chief's brother ,  and then returned ,  too soon however for the welfare of our allies ,  as there yet remained those who might renew hostilities Tiberius however considered the war as finished ,  and awarded Blaesus the further distinction of being hailed Imperator by the legions ,  an ancient honour conferred on generals who for good service to the State were saluted with cheers of joyful enthusiasm by a victorious army
 concessit quibusdam et Augustus id vocabulum ac tunc Tiberius Blaeso postremum$$ Several men bore the title at the same time ,  without pre-eminence above their fellows
 Obiere eo anno viri inlustres Asinius Saloninus , Marco Agrippa et Pollione Asinio avis , fratre Druso insignis Caesarique progener destinatus , et Capito Ateius , de quo memoravi , principem in civitate locum studiis civilibus adsecutus , sed avo centurione Sullano , patre praetorio$$ Two illustrious men died that year One was Asinius Saloninus ,  distinguished as the grandson of Marcus Agrippa ,  and Asinius Pollio ,  as the brother of Drusus and the intended husband of the emperor's granddaughter The other was Capito Ateius ,  already mentioned ,  who had won a foremost position in the State by his legal attainments ,  though his grandfather was but a centurion in Sulla's army ,  his father having been a praetor
 consulatum ei adceleraverat Augustus ut Labeonem Antistium isdem artibus praecellentem dignatione eius magistratus antiret$$ He was prematurely advanced to the consulship by Augustus ,  so that he might be raised by the honour of this promotion above Labeo Antistius ,  a conspicuous member of the same profession
 namque illa aetas duo pacis decora simul tulit$$ That age indeed produced at one time two brilliant ornaments of peace
 sed Labeo incorrupta libertate et ob id fama celebratior , Capitonis obsequium dominantibus magis probabatur$$ But while Labeo was a man of sturdy independence and consequently of wider fame ,  Capito's obsequiousness was more acceptable to those in power
 illi quod praeturam intra stetit commendatio ex iniuria , huic quod consulatum adeptus est odium ex invidia oriebatur$$ Labeo ,  because his promotion was confined to the praetorship ,  gained in public favour through the wrong Capito ,  in obtaining the consulship ,  incurred the hatred which grows out of envy
 Gaius Asinio Gaius Antistio consulibus nonus Tiberio annus erat compositae rei publicae , florentis domus (nam Germanici mortem inter prospera ducebat) , cum repente turbare fortuna coepit , saevire ipse aut saevientibus viris praebere$$ THE year when Caius Asinius and Caius Antistius were consuls was the ninth of Tiberius's reign ,  a period of tranquillity for the State and prosperity for his own house ,  for he counted Germanicus's death a happy incident Suddenly fortune deranged everything the emperor became a cruel tyrant ,  as well as an abettor of cruelty in others
 initium et causa penes Aelium Seianum cohortibus praetoriis praefectum cuius de potentia supra memoravi$$ Of this the cause and origin was Aelius Sejanus ,  commander of the praetorian cohorts ,  of whose influence I have already spoken
 nunc originem , mores , et quo facinore dominationem raptum ierit expediam$$ I will now fully describe his extraction ,  his character ,  and the daring wickedness by which he grasped at power
 genitus Vulsiniis patre Seio Strabone equite Romano , et prima iuventa Gaium Caesarem divi Augusti nepotem sectatus , non sine rumore Apicio diviti et prodigo stuprum veno dedisse , mox Tiberium variis artibus devinxit adeo ut obscurum adversum alios sibi uni incautum intectumque efficeret , non tam sollertia (quippe isdem artibus victus est) quam deum ira in rem Romanam , cuius pari exitio viguit ceciditque$$ Born at Vulsinii ,  the son of Seius Strabo ,  a Roman knight ,  he attached himself in his early youth to Caius Caesar ,  grandson of the Divine Augustus ,  and the story went that he had sold his person to Apicius ,  a rich debauchee Soon afterwards he won the heart of Tiberius so effectually by various artifices that the emperor ,  ever dark and mysterious towards others ,  was with Sejanus alone careless and freespoken It was not through his craft ,  for it was by this very weapon that he was overthrown it was rather from heaven's wrath against Rome ,  to whose welfare his elevation and his fall were alike disastrous
 corpus illi laborum tolerans , animus audax$$ He had a body which could endure hardships ,  and a daring spirit
 sui obtegens , in alios criminator$$ He was one who screened himself ,  while he was attacking others
 iuxta adulatio et superbia$$ he was as cringing as he was imperious
 palam compositus pudor , intus summa apiscendi libido , eiusque causa modo largitio et luxus , saepius industria ac vigilantia , haud minus noxiae quotiens parando regno finguntur$$ before the world he affected humility in his heart he lusted after supremacy ,  for the sake of which he sometimes lavish and luxurious ,  but oftener energetic and watchful ,  qualities quite as mischievous when hypocritically assumed for the attainment of sovereignty
 Vim praefecturae modicam antea intendit , dispersas per urbem cohortis una in castra conducendo , ut simul imperia acciperent numeroque et robore et visu inter se fiducia ipsis , in ceteros metus oreretur$$ He strengthened the hitherto moderate powers of his office by concentrating the cohorts scattered throughout the capital into one camp ,  so that they might all receive orders at the same moment ,  and that the sight of their numbers and strength might give confidence to themselves ,  while it would strike terror into the citizens
 praetendebat lascivire militem diductum si quid subitum ingruat , maiore auxilio pariter subveniri et severius acturos si vallum statuatur procul urbis inlecebris$$ His pretexts were the demoralisation incident to a dispersed soldiery ,  the greater effectiveness of simultaneous action in the event of a sudden peril ,  and the stricter discipline which would be insured by the establishment of an encampment at a distance from the temptations of the city
 ut perfecta sunt castra , inrepere paulatim militaris animos adeundo , appellando$$ As soon as the camp was completed ,  he crept gradually into the affections of the soldiers by mixing with them and addressing them by name ,  himself selecting the centurions and tribunes
 simul centuriones ac tribunos ipse deligere neque senatorio ambitu abstinebat clientes suos honoribus aut provinciis ornandi , facili Tiberio atque ita prono ut socium laborum non modo in sermonibus , sed apud patres et populum celebraret colique per theatra et fora effigies eius interque principia legionum sineret$$ With the Senate too he sought to ingratiate himself ,  distinguishing his partisans with offices and provinces ,  Tiberius readily yielding ,  and being so biassed that not only in private conversation but before the senators and the people he spoke highly of him as the partner of his toils ,  and allowed his statues to be honoured in theatres ,  in forums ,  and at the head-quarters of our legions
 Italiam utroque mari duae classes , Misenum apud et Ravennam , proximumque Galliae litus rostratae naves praesidebant , quas Actiaca victoria captas Augustus in oppidum Foroiuliense miserat valido cum remige$$ Italy on both seas was guarded by fleets ,  at Misenum and at Ravenna ,  and the contiguous coast of Gaul by ships of war captured in the victory of Actium ,  and sent by Augustus powerfully manned to the town of Forojulium
 sed praecipuum robur Rhenum iuxta , commune in Germanos Gallosque subsidium , octo legiones erant$$ But chief strength was on the Rhine ,  as a defence alike against Germans and Gauls ,  and numbered eight legions
 Hispaniae recens perdomitae tribus habebantur$$ Spain ,  lately subjugated ,  was held by three
 Mauros Iuba rex acceperat donum populi Romani$$ Mauretania was king Juba's ,  who had received it as a gift from the Roman people
 cetera Africae per duas legiones parique numero Aegyptus , dehinc initio ab Syriae usque ad flumen Euphraten , quantum ingenti terrarum sinu ambitur , quattuor legionibus coercita , accolis Hibero Albanoque et aliis regibus qui magnitudine nostra proteguntur adversum extema imperia et Thraeciam Rhoemetalces ac liberi Cotyis , ripamque Danuvii legionum duae in Pannonia , duae in Moesia attinebant , totidem apud Delmatiam locatis , quae positu regionis a tergo illis , ac si repentinum auxilium Italia posceret , haud procul accirentur , quamquam insideret urbem proprius miles , tres urbanae , novem praetoriae cohortes , Etruria ferme Vmbriaque delectae aut vetere Latio et coloniis antiquitus Romanis$$ The rest of Africa was garrisoned by two legions ,  and Egypt by the same number Next ,  beginning with Syria ,  all within the entire tract of country stretching as far as the Euphrates ,  was kept in restraint by four legions ,  and on this frontier were Iberian ,  Albanian ,  and other kings ,  to whom our greatness was a protection against any foreign power Thrace was held by Rhoemetalces and the children of Cotys the bank of the Danube by two legions in Pannonia ,  two in Moesia ,  and two also were stationed in Dalmatia ,  which ,  from the situation of the country ,  were in the rear of the other four ,  and ,  should Italy suddenly require aid ,  not to distant to be summoned But the capital was garrisoned by its own special soldiery ,  three city ,  nine praetorian cohorts ,  levied for the most part in Etruria and Umbria ,  or ancient Latium and the old Roman colonies
 at apud idonea provinciarum sociae triremes alaeque et auxilia cohortium , neque multo secus in iis virium$$ There were besides ,  in commanding positions in the provinces ,  allied fleets ,  cavalry and light infantry ,  of but little inferior strength
 sed persequi incertum fuit , cum ex usu temporis huc illuc mearent , gliscerent numero et aliquando minuerentur$$ But any detailed account of them would be misleading ,  since they moved from place to place as circumstances required ,  and had their numbers increased and sometimes diminished
 Congruens crediderim recensere ceteras quoque rei publicae partis , quibus modis ad eam diem habitae sint , quoniam Tiberio mutati in deterius principatus initium ille annus attulit$$ It is however ,  I think ,  a convenient opportunity for me to review the hitherto prevailing methods of administration in the other departments of the State ,  inasmuch as that year brought with it the beginning of a change for the worse in Tiberius's policy
 iam primum publica negotia et privatorum maxima apud patres tractabantur , dabaturque primoribus disserere et in adulationem lapsos cohibebat ipse$$ In the first place ,  public business and the most important private matters were managed by the Senate 
 mandabatque honores , nobilitatem maiorum , claritudinem militiae , iniustris domi artes spectando , ut satis constaret non alios potiores fuisse$$  the leading men were allowed freedom of discussion ,  and when they stooped to flattery ,  the emperor himself checked them
 sua consulibus , sua praetoribus species minorum quoque magistratuum exercita potestas$$ He bestowed honours with regard to noble ancestry ,  military renown ,  or brilliant accomplishments as a civilian ,  letting it be clearly seen that there were no better men to choose
 legesque , si maiestatis quaestio eximeretur , bono in usu$$ The consul and the praetor retained their prestige
 at frumenta et pecuniae vectigales , cetera publicorum fructuum societatibus equitum Romanorum agitabantur$$ inferior magistrates exercised their authority the laws too ,  with the single exception of cases of treason ,  were properly enforced
 res suas Caesar spectatissimo cuique , quibusdam ignotis ex fama mandabat , semelque adsumpti tenebantur prorsus sine modo , cum plerique isdem negotiis insenescereut$$ As to the duties on corn ,  the indirect taxes and other branches of the public revenue ,  they were in the hands of companies of Roman knights
 plebes acri quidem annona fatigabatur , sed nulla in eo culpa ex principe quin infecunditati terrarum aut asperis maris obviam iit , quantum impendio diligentiaque poterat$$ The emperor intrusted his own property to men of the most tried integrity or to persons known only by their general reputation ,  and once appointed they were retained without any limitation ,  so that most of them grew old in the same employments
 et ne provinciae novis oneribus turbarentur utque vetera sine avaritia aut crudelitate magistratnum tolerarent providebat$$ The city populace indeed suffered much from high prices ,  but this was no fault of the emperor ,  who actually endeavoured to counteract barren soils and stormy seas with every resource of wealth and foresight
 corporum verbera , ademptiones bonorum aberant rari per Italiam Caesaris agri , modesta servitia , intra paucos libertos domus$$ And he was also careful not to distress the provinces by new burdens ,  and to see that in bearing the old they were safe from any rapacity or oppression on the part of governors
 ac si quando cum privatis disceptaret , forum et ius$$ Corporal punishments and confiscations of property were unknown
 Quae cuncta non quidem comi via sed horridus ac plerumque formidatus retinebat tamen , donec morte Drusi verterentur$$ The emperor had only a few estates in Italy ,  slaves on a moderate scale ,  and his household was confined to a few freedmen If ever he had a dispute with a private person ,  it was decided in the law courts
 nam dum superfuit mansere , quia Seianus incipiente adhuc potentia bonis consiliis notescere volebat , et ultor metuebatur non occultus odii set crebro querens ro incolumi filio adiutorem imperii alium vocari et quantum superesse ut collega dicatur$$ All this ,  not indeed with any graciousness ,  but in a blunt fashion which often alarmed ,  he still kept up ,  until the death of Drusus changed everything While he lived ,  the system continued ,  because Sejanus ,  as yet only in the beginning of his power ,  wished to be known as an upright counsellor ,  and there was one whose vengeance he dreaded ,  who did not conceal his hatred and incessantly complained that a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive

 consulesque sede vulgari per speciem maestitiae sedentis honoris locique admonuit , et effusum in lacrimas senatum victo gemitu simul oratione continua erexit$$ Seeing the consuls ,  in token of their grief ,  sitting on the ordinary benches ,  he reminded them of their high office and of their proper place
 non quidem sibi ignarum posse argui quod tam recenti dolore subierit oculos senatus$$ and when the Senate burst into tears ,  suppressing a groan ,  he revived their spirits with a fluent speech

 ita nati estis ut bona malaque vestra ad rem publicam pertineant$$ To you ,  Nero and Drusus ,  these senators are as fathers

 ac si modum orationi posuisset , misericordia sui gloriaque animoi audientium impleverat$$ Had the emperor set bounds to his speech ,  he must have filled the hearts of his hearers with sympathy and admiration
 ad vana et totiens inrisa revolutus , de reddenda re publica utque consules seu quis alius regimen susciperent , vero quoque et honesto fidem dempsit$$ But he now fell back on those idle and often ridiculed professions about restoring the republic ,  and the wish that the consuls or some one else might undertake the government ,  and thus destroyed belief even in what was genuine and noble
 memoriae Drusi eadem quae in Germanicum decernuntur , plerisque additis , ut ferme amat posterior adulatio$$ The same honours were decreed to the memory of Drusus as to that of Germanicus ,  and many more were added
 funus imaginum pompa maxime inlustre fuit , cum origo luliae gentis Aeneas omnesque Albanorum reges et conditor urbis Romulus , post Sabina nobilitas , Attus Clausus ceteracque Claudiorum effigies longo ordine spectarentur$$ Such is the way with flattery ,  when repeated The funeral with its procession of statues was singularly grand Aeneas ,  the father of the Julian house ,  all the Alban kings ,  Romulus ,  Rome's founder ,  then the Sabine nobility ,  Attus Clausus ,  and the busts of all the other Claudii were displayed in a long train
 Ceterum laudante filium pro rostris Tiberio senatus populusque habitum ac voces dolentum simulatione magis quam libens induebat , domumque Germanici revirescere occulti laetabantur$$ Tiberius pronounced a panegyric on his son before the Rostra ,  during which the Senate and people ,  in appearance rather than in heart ,  put on the expression and accents of sorrow ,  while they inwardly rejoiced at the brightening future of the family of Germanicus
 quod principium favoris et mater Agrippina spem male tegens perniciem adceleravere$$ This beginning of popularity and the ill-concealed ambition of their mother Agrippina ,  hastened its downfall
 nam Seianus ubi videt mortem Drusi inultam interfectoribus , sine maerore publico esse , ferox scelerum et , quia prima provenerant , volutare secum quonam modo Germanici liberos perverteret , quorum non dubia successio$$ Sejanus when he saw that the death of Drusus was not avenged on the murderers and was no grief to the people ,  grew bold in wickedness ,  and ,  now that his first attempt had succeeded ,  speculated on the possibility of destroying the children of Germanicus ,  whose succession to the throne was a certainty
 neque spargi venenum in tres poterat , egregia custodum fide et pudicitia Agrippinae impenetrabili$$ There were three ,  and poison could not be distributed among them ,  because of the singular fidelity of their guardians and the unassailable virtue of Agrippina
 igitur contumaciam eius insectari , vetus Augustae odium , recentem Liviae conscientiam exagitare , ut superbam fecunditate , subnixam popularibus studiis inhiare dominationi apud Caesarem arguerent$$ So Sejanus inveighed against Agrippina's arrogance ,  and worked powerfully on Augusta's old hatred of her and on Livia's consciousness of recent guilt ,  and urged both these women to represent to the emperor that her pride as a mother and her reliance on popular enthusiasm were leading her to dream of empire
 atque haec callidis criminatoribus , inter quos delegerat Iulium Postumum , per adulterium Mutiliae Priscae inter intimos aviae et consiliis suis peridoneum , quia Prisca in animo Augustae valida anum suapte natura potentiae anxiam insociabilem nurui efficiebat$$ Livia availed herself of the cunning of accusers ,  among whom she had selected Julius Postumus ,  a man well suited to her purpose ,  as he had an intrigue with Mutilia Prisca ,  and was consequently in the confidence of Augusta ,  over whose mind Prisca had great influence She thus made her aged grandmother ,  whose nature it was to tremble for her power ,  irreconcilably hostile to her grandson's widow
 Agrippinae quoque proximi inliciebantur pravis sermonibus tumidos spiritus perstimulare$$ Agrippina's friends too were induced to be always inciting her proud spirit by mischievous talk

 nam patricios confarrc atis parentibus genitos tres simul nominari , ex quis unus legeretur , vetusto more$$ It was ,  he said ,  the old custom to nominate together three patricians ,  sons of parents wedded according to the primitive ceremony ,  and of these one was to be chosen
 neque adesse , ut olim , eam copiam , omissa confarreandi adsuetudine aut inter paucos retenta (pluresque eius rei causas adferebat , potissimam penes incuriam virorum feminarumque$$ Now however there was not the same choice as formerly ,  the primitive form of marriage having been given up or being observed only by a few persons For this he assigned several reasons ,  the chief being men's and women's indifference
 accedere ipsius caerimoniae difltcultates quae consulto vitarentur) et quoniam exiret e iure patrio qui id flamonium apisceretur quaeque in manum flaminis conveniret$$ then ,  again ,  the ceremony itself had its difficulties ,  which were purposely avoided and there was the objection that the man who obtained this priesthood was emancipated from the father's authority ,  as also was his wife ,  as passing into the husband's control
 ita medendum senatus decreto aut lege , sicut Augustus quaedam ex horrida illa antiquitate ad praescentem usum flexisset$$ So the Senate ,  Tiberius argued ,  ought to apply some remedy by a decree of a law ,  as Augustus had accommodated certain relics of a rude antiquity to the modern spirit
 igitur tractatis religionibus placitum instituto flaminum nihil demutari$$ It was then decided ,  after a discussion of religious questions ,  that the institution of the priests of Jupiter should remain unchanged
 sed lata lex qua flaminica Dialis sacrorum causa in potestate viri , cetera promisco feminarum iure ageret$$ A law however was passed that the priestess ,  in regard to her sacred functions ,  was to be under the husband's control ,  but in other respects to retain the ordinary legal position of women

 hos corripi dilato ad tempus Sabino placitum , immissusque Varro consul qui patennas inimicitias obtendens odiis Seiani per dedecus suum gratifcabatur$$ The two ,  it was decided ,  were to be attacked ,  but Sabinus was to be put off for a time Varro ,  the consul ,  was let loose on them ,  who ,  under colour of a hereditary feud ,  humoured the malignity of Sejanus to his own disgrace
 precante reo brevem moram , dum accusator consulatu abiret , adversatus est Caesar$$ The accused begged a brief respite ,  until the prosecutor's consulship expired ,  but the emperor opposed the request
 solitum quippe magistratibus diem privatis dicere nec infringendum consulis ius , cuius vigiliis niteretur ne quod res publica detrimentum caperet$$ It was usual ,  he argued ,  for magistrates to bring a private citizen to trial ,  and a consul's authority ought not to be impaired ,  seeing that it rested with his vigilance to guard the commonwealth from loss
 proprium id Tiberio fuit scelera nuper reperta priscis verbis obtegere$$ It was characteristic of Tiberius to veil new devices in wickedness under ancient names
 igitur multa adseveratione , quasi aut legibus cum Silio ageretur aut Varro consul aut illud res publica esset , coguntur patres , silente reo , vel si defensionem coeptaret , non occultante cuius ira premeretur$$ And so ,  with a solemn appeal ,  he summoned the Senate ,  as if there were any laws by which Silius was being tried ,  as if Varro were a real consul ,  or Rome a commonwealth The accused either said nothing ,  or ,  if he attempted to defend himself ,  hinted ,  not obscurely ,  at the person whose resentment was crushing him
 conscientia belli Sacrovir diu dissimulatus , victoria per avaritiam foedata et uxor socia arguebantur$$ A long concealed complicity in Sacrovir's rebellion ,  a rapacity which sullied his victory ,  and his wife Sosia's conduct ,  were alleged against him
 nec dubie repetundarum criminibus haerebant , sed cuncta quaestione maiestatis exercita , et Silius imminentem damnationem voluntario fine praevertit$$ Unquestionably ,  they could not extricate themselves from the charge of extortion The whole affair however was conducted as a trial for treason ,  and Silius forestalled impending doom by a self-inflicted death
 Actum dehinc de Calpurnio Pisone , nobili ac feroci viro$$ Proceedings were then taken against Calpurnius Piso ,  a high-spirited nobleman
 is namque , ut rettuli , cessurum se urbe ob factines accusatorum in senatu clamitaverat et spreta potentia Augustae trahere in ius Vrgulaniam domoque principis excire ausus erat$$ He it was ,  as I have related ,  who had exclaimed more than once in the Senate that he would quit Rome because of the combinations of the informers ,  and had dared in defiance of Augusta's power ,  to sue Urgulania and summon her from the emperor's palace
 quae in praesens Tiberius civiliter habuit sed in animo revolvente iras , etiam si impetus offensionis languerat , memoria valebat$$ Tiberius submitted to this at the time not ungraciously ,  but the remembrance of it was vividly impressed on a mind which brooded over its resentments ,  even though the first impulse of his displeasure had subsided

 Per idem tempus Plautius Silvanus praetor incertis causis Aproniam coniugem in praeceps iecit , tractusque ad Caesarem ab Lucius Apronio socero turbata mente respondit , tamquam ipse somno gravis atque eo ignarus , et uxor sponte mortem sumpsisset$$ About the same time Plautius Silvanus ,  the praetor ,  for unknown reasons ,  threw his wife Apronia out of a window When summoned before the emperor by Lucius Apronius ,  his father-in-law ,  he replied incoherently ,  representing that he was in a sound sleep and consequently knew nothing ,  and that his wife had chosen to destroy herself
 non cunctanter Tiberius pergit in domum , visit cubiculum , in quo reluctantis et impulsae vestigia cernebantur$$ Without a moment's delay Tiberius went to the house and inspected the chamber ,  where were seen the marks of her struggling and of her forcible ejection
 refert ad senatum , datisque iudicibus Vrgulania Silvani avia pugionem nepoti misit$$ He reported this to the Senate ,  and as soon as judges had been appointed ,  Urgulania ,  the grandmother of Silvanus ,  sent her grandson a dagger
 quod perinde creditum quasi principis monitu ob amicitiam Augustae cum Vrgulania$$ This was thought equivalent to a hint from the emperor ,  because of the known intimacy between Augusta and Urgulania
 reus frustra temptato ferro venas praebuit exolvendas$$ The accused tried the steel in vain ,  and then allowed his veins to be opened
 mox Numantina , prior uxor eius , accusata iniecisse carminibus et veneficiis vaecordiam marito , insons iudicatur$$ Shortly afterwards Numantina ,  his former wife ,  was charged with having caused her husband's insanity by magical incantations and potions ,  but she was acquitted
 Igitur Tacfarinas disperso rumore rem Romanam aliis quoque ab nationibus lacerari eoque paulatim Africa decedere , ac posse reliquos circumveniri , si cuncti quibus libertas servitio potior incubuissent , auget viris positisque castris Thubuscum oppidum circumsidet$$ Tacfarinas accordingly spread rumours that elsewhere also nations were rending the empire of Rome and that therefore her soldiers were gradually retiring from Africa ,  and that the rest might be cut off by a strong effort on the part of all who loved freedom more than slavery He thus augmented his force ,  and having formed a camp ,  he besieged the town of Thubuscum
 at Dolabella contracto quod erat militum , terrore nominis Romani et quia Numidae peditum aciem ferre nequeunt , primo sui incessu solvit obsidium locorumque opportuna permunivit$$ Dolabella meanwhile collecting all the troops on the spot ,  raised the siege at his first approach ,  by the terror of the Roman name and because the Numidians cannot stand against the charge of infantry

 dein quia pluribus adversum Tacfarinatem expeditionibus cognitum non gravi nec uno incursu consectandum hostem vagum , excito cum popularibus rege Ptolemaeo quattuor agmina parat , quae legatis aut tribunis data$$ Next ,  as several expeditions against Tacfarinas had proved the uselessness of following up the enemy's desultory movements with the attack of heavy troops from a single point ,  he summoned to his aid king Ptolemaeus and his people ,  and equipped four columns ,  under the command of his lieutenants and tribunes
 et praedatorias manus delecti Maurorum duxere$$ Marauding parties were also led by picked Moors ,  Dolabella in person directing every operation

 differtur per manipulos , Tacfarinatem omnes notum tot proeliis consectentur non nisi duce interfecto requiem belli fore$$ The word went through the companies that all were to aim at securing Tacfarinas ,  whom ,  after so many battles ,  they knew well ,  as there would be no rest from war except by the destruction of the enemy's leader

 Eadem aestate mota per Italiam servilis belli semina fors oppressit$$ The same summer ,  the germs of a slave war in Italy were crushed by a fortunate accident
 auctor tumultus Titus Curtisius , quondam praetoriae cohortis miles , primo coetibus clandestinis apud Brundisium et circumiecta oppida , mox positis propalam libellis ad libertatem vocabat agrestia per longinquos saltus et ferocia servitia , cum velut munere deum tres biremes adpulere ad usus commeantium illo mari et erat isdem regionibus Cutius Lupus quaestor , cui provincia vetere ex more calles evenerant$$ The originator of the movement was Titus Curtisius ,  once a soldier of the praetorian guard First ,  by secret meetings at Brundisium and the neighbouring towns ,  then by placards publicly exhibited ,  he incited the rural and savage slave-population of the remote forests to assert their freedom By divine providence ,  three vessels came to land for the use of those who traversed that sea In the same part of the country too was Curtius Lupus ,  the quaestor ,  who ,  according to ancient precedent ,  had had the charge of the woodland pastures assigned to him
 is disposita classiariomm copia coeptantem cum maxime coniurationem disiecit$$ Putting in motion a force of marines ,  he broke up the seditious combination in its very first beginnings

 quo magis mirum habebatur gnarum meliorum et quae fama clementiam sequeretur tristiora malle$$ Hence it seemed the more amazing that one who knew better things and the glory which waits on mercy ,  should prefer harsher courses
 neque enim socordia peccabat nec occultum est , quando ex veritate , quando adumbrata laetitia facta imperatorum celebrentur$$ He did not indeed err from dulness ,  and it is easy to see when the acts of a sovereign meet with genuine ,  and when with fictitious popularity
 quin ipse , compositus alias et velut eluctantium verborum , solutius promptiusque eloquebatur quotiens subveniret$$ And even he himself ,  though usually artificial in manner ,  and though his words escaped him with a seeming struggle ,  spoke out freely and fluently whenever he came to a man's rescue
 at Publius Suillium quaestorem quondam Germanici , cum Italia arceretur convictus pecuniam ob rem iudicandam cepisse , amovendum in insulam censuit , tanta contentione animi ut iure iurando obstringeret e re publica id esse$$ In another case ,  that of Publius Suillius ,  formerly quaestor to Germanicus ,  who was to be expelled from Italy on a conviction of having received money for a judicial decision ,  he held that the man ought to be banished to an island ,  and so intensely strong was his feeling that he bound the Senate by an oath that this was a State necessity
 quod aspere acceptum ad praesens mox in laudem vertit regresso Suillio$$ The act was thought cruel at the moment ,  but subsequently it redounded to his honour when Suillius returned from exile

 delecta ex iis et consociata rei publicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire , vel si evenit , haud diuturna esse potest$$ A constitution ,  formed by selection out of these elements ,  it is easy to commend but not to produce
 igitur ut olim plebe valida , vel cum patres pollerent , noscenda vulgi natura et quibus modis temperanter haberetur , senatusque et optimatium ingenia qui maxime perdidicerant , callidi temporum et sapientes credebantur , sic converso statu neque alia re Romana quam si unus imperitet , haec conquiri tradique in rem fuerit , quia pauci prudentia honesta ab deterioribus , utilia ab noxiis discernunt , plures aliorum eventis docentur$$ or ,  if it is produced ,  it cannot be lasting Formerly ,  when the people had power or when the patricians were in the ascendant ,  the popular temper and the methods of controlling it ,  had to be studied ,  and those who knew most accurately the spirit of the Senate and aristocracy ,  had the credit of understanding the age and of being wise men So now ,  after a revolution ,  when Rome is nothing but the realm of a single despot ,  there must be good in carefully noting and recording this period ,  for it is but few who have the foresight to distinguish right from wrong or what is sound from what is hurtful ,  while most men learn wisdom from the fortunes of others
 ceterum ut profutura , ita minimum oblectationis adferunt$$ Still ,  though this is instructive ,  it gives very little pleasure
 nam situs gentium , varietates proeliorum , clari ducum exitus retinent ac redintegrant legentium animum$$ Descriptions of countries ,  the various incidents of battles ,  glorious deaths of great generals ,  enchain and refresh a reader's mind
 nos saeva iussa , continuas accusationes , fallaces amicitias , perniciem innocentium et easdem exitii causas coniungimus , obvia rerum similitudine et satietate$$ I have to present in succession the merciless biddings of a tyrant ,  incessant prosecutions ,  faithless friendships ,  the ruin of innocence ,  the same causes issuing in the same results ,  and I am everywhere confronted by a wearisome monotony in my subject matter
 tum quod antiquis scriptoribus rarus obtrectator , neque refert cuiusquam Punicas Romanasne acies laetius extuleris$$ Then ,  again ,  an ancient historian has but few disparagers ,  and no one cares whether you praise more heartily the armies of Carthage or Rome
 at multorum qui Tiberio regente poenam vel infamias subiere posteri manent$$ But of many who endured punishment or disgrace under Tiberius ,  the descendants yet survive
 utque familiae ipsae iam extinctae sint , reperies qui ob similitudinem morum aliena malefacta sibi obiectari putent$$ or even though the families themselves may be now extinct ,  you will find those who ,  from a resemblance of character ,  imagine that the evil deeds of others are a reproach to themselves
 etiam gloria ac virtus infensos habet , ut nimis ex propinquo diversa arguens$$ Again ,  even honour and virtue make enemies ,  condemning ,  as they do ,  their opposites by too close a contrast
 sed ad inceptum redeo$$ But I return to my work
 Cornelio Cosso Asinio Agrippa consulibus Cremutius Cordus postulatur novo ac tunc primum audito crimine , quod editis annalibus laudatoque Marcus Bruto Gaius Cassium Romanorum ultimum dixisset$$ In the year of the consulship of Cornelius Cossus and Asinius Agrippa ,  Cremutius Cordus was arraigned on a new charge ,  now for the first time heard
 accusabant Satrius Secundus et Pinarius Natta , Seiani clientes$$ He had published a history in which he had praised Marcus Brutus and called Caius Cassius the last of the Romans
 id perniciabile reo et Caesar truci vultu defensionem accipiens , quam Cremutius relinquendae vitae certus in hunc modum exorsus est$$ His accusers were Satrius Secundus and Pinarius Natta ,  creatures of Sejanus
 verba mea , patres conscripti , arguuntur$$ This was enough to ruin the accused
 adeo factorum innocens sum$$ and then too the emperor listened with an angry frown to his defence ,  which Cremutius ,  resolved to give up his life ,  began thus 
 sed neque haec in principem aut principis parentem , quos lex maiestatis amplectitur$$  , It is my words ,  Senators ,  which are condemned ,  so innocent am I of any guilty act
 Brutum et Cassium laudavisse dicor , quorum res gestas cum plurimi composuerint , nemo sine honore memoravit$$ yet these do not touch the emperor or the emperor's mother ,  who are alone comprehended under the law of treason
 Titus Livius , eloquentiae ac fidei praeclarus in primis , Gnaeus Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret$$ I am said to have praised Brutus and Cassius ,  whose careers many have described and no one mentioned without eulogy
 neque id amicitiae eorum offecit Scipionem , Afranium , hunc ipsum Cassium , hunc Brutum nusquam latrones et parricidas , quae nunc vocabula imponuntur , saepe ut insignis viros nominat$$ Titus Livius ,  pre-eminently famous for eloquence and truthfulness ,  extolled Cneius Pompeius in such a panegyric that Augustus called him Pompeianus ,  and yet this was no obstacle to their friendship
 Asinii Pollionis scripta egregiam eorundem memoriam tradunt$$ Scipio ,  Afranius ,  this very Cassius ,  this same Brutus ,  he nowhere describes as brigands and traitors ,  terms now applied to them ,  but repeatedly as illustrious men
 Messala Corvinus imperatorem suum Cassium praedicabat$$ Asinius Pollio's writings too hand down a glorious memory of them ,  and Messala Corvinus used to speak with pride of Cassius as his general
 et uterque opibusque atque honoribus perviguere$$ Yet both these men prospered to the end with wealth and preferment
 Marci Ciceronis libro quo Catonem caelo aequavit , quid aliud dictator Caesar quam rescripta oratione velut apud iudices respondit$$ Again ,  that book of Marcus Cicero ,  in which he lauded Cato to the skies ,  how else was it answered by Caesar the dictator ,  than by a written oration in reply ,  as if he was pleading in court
 Antonii epistulae Bruti contiones falsa quidem in Augustum probra set multa cum acerbitate habent$$ The letters Antonius ,  the harangues of Brutus contain reproaches against Augustus ,  false indeed ,  but urged with powerful sarcasm
 carmina Bibaculi et Catulli referta contumeliis Caesarum leguntur$$ the poems which we read of Bibaculus and Catullus are crammed with invectives on the Caesars
 sed ipse divus Iulius , ipse divus Augustus et tulere ista et reliquere , haud facile dixerim , moderatione magis an sapientia$$ Yet the Divine Julius ,  the Divine Augustus themselves bore all this and let it pass ,  whether in forbearance or in wisdom I cannot easily say
 namque spreta exolescunt$$ Assuredly what is despised is soon forgotten
 si irascare , adgnita videntur$$ when you resent a thing ,  you seem to recognise it
 Per idem tempus Hispania ulterior missis ad senatum legatis oravit ut exemplo Asiae delubrum Tiberio matrique eius extrueret$$ About the same time Further Spain sent a deputation to the Senate ,  with a request to be allowed ,  after the example of Asia ,  to erect a temple to Tiberius and his mother
 qua occasione Caesar , validus alioqui spernendis honoribus et respondendum ratus iis quorum rumore arguebatur in ambitionem flexisse , huiusce modi orationem coepit$$ On this occasion ,  the emperor ,  who had generally a strong contempt for honours ,  and now thought it right to reply to the rumour which reproached him with having yielded to vanity ,  delivered the following speech 
 scio , patres conscripti , constantiam meam a plerisque desideratam quod Asiae civitatibus nuper idem istud petentibus non sim adversatus$$ I am aware ,  Senators ,  that many deplore my want of firmness in not having opposed a similar recent petition from the cities of Asia
 ergo et prioris silentii defensionem et quid in futurum statuerim simul aperiam$$ I will therefore both explain the grounds of my previous silence and my intentions for the future
 cum divus Augustus sibi atque urbi Romae templum apud Pergamum sisti non prohibuisset , qui omnia facta dictaque eius vice legis observem , placitum iam exemplum promptius secutus sum quia cultui meo veneratio senatus adiungebatur$$ Inasmuch as the Divine Augustus did not forbid the founding of a temple at Pergamos to himself and to the city of Rome ,  I who respect as law all his actions and sayings ,  have the more readily followed a precedent once approved ,  seeing that with the worship of myself was linked an expression of reverence towards the Senate
 ceterum ut semel recepisse veniam habuerit , ita per omnis provincias effgie numinum sacrari ambitiosum , superbum et vanescet Augusti honor si promiscis adulationibus vulgatur$$ But though it may be pardonable to have allowed this once ,  it would be a vain and arrogant thing to receive the sacred honour of images representing the divine throughout all the provinces ,  and the homage paid to Augustus will disappear if it is vulgarised by indiscriminate flattery
 Ego me , patres conscripti , mortalem esse et hominum officia fungi satisque habere si locum principem impleam et vos testor et meminisse posteros volo$$ For myself ,  Senators ,  I am mortal and limited to the functions of humanity ,  content if I can adequately fill the highest place
 qui satis superque memoriae meae tribuent , ut maioribus meis dignum , rerum vestrarum providum , constantem in periculis , offensionum pro utilitate publica non pavidum credant$$ of this I solemnly assure you ,  and would have posterity remember it They will more than sufficiently honour my memory by believing me to have been worthy of my ancestry ,  watchful over your interests ,  courageous in danger ,  fearless of enmity ,  when the State required it
 haec mihi in animis vestris templa , hae pulcherrimae effigies et mansurae$$ These sentiments of your hearts are my temples ,  these my most glorious and abiding monuments
 nam quae saxo struuntur , si iudicium posterorum in odium vertit , pro sepulchris spernuntur$$ Those built of stone are despised as mere tombs ,  if the judgment of posterity passes into hatred
 proinde socios civis et deos ipsos precor , hos ut mihi ad finem usque vitae quietam et intellegentem humani divinique iuris mentem duint , illos ut , quandoque concessero , cum laude et bonis recordationibus facta atque famam nominis mei prosequantur$$ And therefore this is my prayer to our allies ,  our citizens ,  and to heaven itself to the last ,  that ,  to my life's close ,  it grant me a tranquil mind ,  which can discern alike human and divine claims to the first ,  that ,  when I die ,  they honour my career and the reputation of my name with praise and kindly remembrance
 perstititque posthac secretis etiam sermonibus aspernari talem sui cultum$$ Henceforth Tiberius even in private conversations persisted in showing contempt for such homage to himself
 quod alii modestiam , multi , quia diffideret , quidam ut degeneris animi interpretabantur$$ Some attributed this to modesty many to self-distrust
 optumos quippe mortalium altissima cupere$$ a few to a mean spirit
 sic Herculem et Liberum apud Graecos , Quirinum apud nos deum numero additos$$ The noblest men ,  it was said ,  have the loftiest aspirations ,  and so Hercules and Bacchus among the Greeks and Quirinus among us were enrolled in the number of the gods
 melius Augustum , qui speraverit$$ Augustus ,  did better ,  seeing that he had aspired
 cetera principibus statim adesse$$ All other things princes have as a matter of course
 unum insatiabiliter parandum , prosperam sui memoriam$$ one thing they ought insatiably to pursue ,  that their memory may be glorious
 nam contemptu famae contemni virtutes$$ For to despise fame is to despise merit
 Ad ea Tiberius laudata pietate Seiani suisque in eum beneficiis modice percursis , cum tempus tamquam ad integram consultationem petivisset , adiunxit ceteris mortalibus in eo stare consilia quid sibi conducere putent$$ Tiberius ,  in reply ,  after praising the loyal sentiments of Sejanus and briefly enumerating the favours he had bestowed on him ,  asked time for impartial consideration ,  adding that while other men's plans depended on their ideas of their own interest ,  princes ,  who had to regulate their chief actions by public opinion ,  were in a different position
 principum diversam esse sortem quibus praecipua rerum ad famam derigenda ideo se non illuc decurrere , quod promptum rescriptu , posse ipsam Liviam statuere , nubendum post Drusum an in penatibus isdem tolerandum haberet$$ Hence ,  he said ,  I do not take refuge in an answer which it would be easy to return ,  that Livia can herself decide whether she considers that ,  after Drusus ,  she ought again to marry or rather to endure life in the same home ,  and that she has in her mother and grandmother counsellors nearer and dearer to her
 esse illi matrem et aviam , propiora consilia$$ I will deal more frankly
 simplicius acturum , de inimicitiis primum Agrippinae , quas longe acrius arsuras si matrimonium Liviae velut in partis domum Caesarum distraxisset$$ First ,  as to the enmity of Agrippina ,  I maintain that it will blaze out more fiercely if Livia's marriage rends ,  so to say ,  the house of the Caesars into two factions
 sic quoque erumpere aemulationem feminarum , eaque discordia nepotes suos convelli$$ Even as it is ,  feminine jealousies break out ,  and my grandsons are torn asunder by the strife
 quid si intendatur certamen tali coniugio$$ What will happen if the rivalry is rendered more intense by such a marriage
 falleris enim , Seiane , si te mansurum in eodem ordine putas , et Liviam , quae G Caesari , mox Druso nupta fuerit , ea mente acturam ut cum equite Romano senescat$$ For you are mistaken ,  Sejanus ,  if you think that you will then remain in the same position ,  and that Livia ,  who has been the wife of Caius Caesar and afterwards of Drusus ,  will have the inclination to pass her old age with a mere Roman knight
 ego ut sinam , credisne passuros qui fratrem eius , qui patrem maioresque nostros in summis imperiis videre$$ Though I might allow it ,  do you imagine it would be tolerated by those who have seen her brother ,  her father ,  and our ancestors in the highest offices of state
 vis tu quidem istum intra locum sistere$$ You indeed desire to keep within your station
 sed illi magistratus et primores , qui te invitum perrumpunt omnibusque de rebus consulunt , excessisse iam pridem equestre fastigium longeque antisse patris mei amicitias non occulti ferunt perque invidiam tui me quoque incusant$$ but those magistrates and nobles who intrude on you against your wishes and consult you on all matters ,  openly give out that you have long overstepped the rank of a knight and gone far beyond my father's friendships ,  and from their dislike of you they also condemn me
 at enim Augustus filiam suam equiti Romano tradere meditatus est$$ But ,  you say ,  Augustus had thoughts of giving his daughter to a Roman knight
 mirum hercule , si cum in omnis curas distraheretur immensumque attolli provideret quem coniunctione tali super alios extulisset , Gaius Proculeium et quosdam in sermonibus habuit insigni tranquillitate vitae , nullis rei publicae negotiis permixtos$$ Is it surprising that ,  with so many distracting cares ,  foreseeing too the immense elevation to which a man would be raised above others by such an alliance ,  he talked of Caius Proculeius and certain persons of singularly quiet life ,  wholly free from political entanglements
 sed si dubitatione Augusti movemur , quanto validius est quod Marco Agrippae , mox mihi conlocavit$$ Still ,  if the hesitation of Augustus is to influence us ,  how much stronger is the fact that he bestowed his daughter on Marcus Agrippa ,  then on myself
 atque ego haec pro amicitia non occultavi$$ All this ,  as a friend ,  I have stated without reserve ,  but I will not oppose your plans or those of Livia
 ceterum neque tuis neque Liviae destinatis adversabor$$ My own earnest thoughts and the ties with which I am still purposing to unite you to myself ,  I shall for the present forbear to explain
 ipse quid intra animum volutaverim , quibus adhuc necessitudinibus immiscere te mihi parem , omittam ad praesens referre$$ This only I will declare ,  that nothing is too grand to be deserved by your merits and your goodwill towards me
 id tantum aperiam , nihil esse tam excelsum quod non virtutes istae tuusque in me animus mereantur , datoque tempore vel in senatu s vel in contione non reticebo$$ When an opportunity presents itself ,  either in the Senate ,  or in a popular assembly ,  I shall not be silent
 Ac forte habita per illos dies de Votieno Montano , celebris ingenii viro , cognitio cunctantem iam Tiberium perpulit ut vitandos crederet patrum coetus vocesque quae plerumque verae et graves coram ingerebantur$$ It happened that the trial at this time of Votienus Montanus ,  a popular wit ,  convinced the hesitating Tiberius that he ought to shun all assemblies of the Senate ,  where speeches ,  often true and offensive ,  were flung in his very face
 nam postulato Votieno ob contumelias in Caesarem dictas , testis Aemilius e militaribus viris , dum studio probandi cuncta refert et quamquam inter obstrepentis magna adseveratione nititur , audivit Tiberius probra quis per occuitum lacerabatur , adeoque perculsus est ut se vel statim vel in cognitione purgaturum clamitaret precibusque proximorum , adulatione omnium aegre componeret animum$$ Votienus was charged with insulting expressions towards the emperor ,  and while the witness ,  Aemilius ,  a military man ,  in his eagerness to prove the case ,  repeated the whole story and amid angry clamour struggled on with loud assertion ,  Tiberius heard the reproaches by which he was assailed in secret ,  and was so deeply impressed that he exclaimed that he would clear himself either at once or on a legal inquiry ,  and the entreaties of friends ,  with the flattery of the whole assembly ,  hardly restored his composure
 et Votienus quidem maiestatis poenis adfectus est$$ As for Votienus ,  he suffered the penalty of treason
 Caesar obiectam sibi adversus reos inclementiam eo pervicacius amplexus , Aquiliam adulterii delatam cum Vario Ligure , quamquam Lentulus Gaetulicus consul designatus lege Iulia damnasset , exilio punivit Apidiumque Merulam quod in acta divi Augusti non iuraverat albo senatorio erasit$$ but the emperor ,  clinging all the more obstinately to the harshness with which he had been reproached in regard to accused persons ,  punished Aquilia with exile for the crime of adultery with Varius Ligur ,  although Lentulus Gaetulicus ,  the consul-elect ,  had proposed that she should be sentenced under the Julian law He next struck off Apidius Merula from the register of the Senate for not having sworn obedience to the legislation of the Divine Augustus
 Obiere eo anno viri nobiles Gnaeus Lentulus et Lucius Domitius$$ Two men of noble rank died in that year ,  Cneius Lentulus and Lucius Domitius
 Lentulo super consulatum et triumphalia de Getis gloriae fuerat bene tolerata paupertas , dein magnae opes innocenter partae et modeste habitae$$ It had been the glory of Lentulus ,  to say nothing of his consulship and his triumphal distinctions over the Gaetuli ,  to have borne poverty with a good grace ,  then to have attained great wealth ,  which had been blamelessly acquired and was modestly enjoyed
 Domitium decoravit pater civili bello maris potens , donec Antonii partibus , mox Caesaris misceretur$$ Domitius derived lustre from a father who during the civil war had been master of the sea ,  till he united himself to the party of Antonius and afterwards to that of Caesar
 avus Pharsalica acie pro optumatibus ceciderat$$ His grandfather had fallen in the battle of Pharsalia ,  fighting for the aristocracy
 ipse delectus cui minor Antonia , Octavia genita , in matrimonium daretur , post exercitu flumen Albim transcendit , longius penetrata Germania quam quisquam priorum , easque ob res insignia triumphi adeptus est$$ He had himself been chosen to be the husband of the younger Antonia ,  daughter of Octavia ,  and subsequently led an army across the Elbe ,  penetrating further into Germany than any Roman before him For this achievement he gained triumphal honours
 obiit et Lucius Antonius , multa claritudine generis sed improspera$$ Lucius Antonius too then died ,  of a most illustrious but unfortunate family
 nam patre eius Iullo Antonio ob adulterium Iuliae morte punito hunc admodum adulescentulum , sororis nepotem , seposuit Augustus in civitatem Massiliensem ubi specie studiorum nomen exilii tegeretur$$ His father ,  Julius Antonius ,  was capitally punished for adultery with Julia ,  and the son ,  when a mere youth ,  was banished by Augustus ,  whose sister's grandson he was ,  to the city of Massilia ,  where the name of exile might be masked under that of student
 habitus tamen supremis honor ossaque tumulo Octaviorum inlata per decretum senatus$$ Yet honour was paid him in death ,  and his bones ,  by the Senate's decree ,  were consigned to the sepulchre of the Octavii
 Isdem consulibus facinus atrox in citeriore Hispania admissum a quodam agresti nationis Termestinae$$ While the same consuls were in office ,  an atrocious crime was committed in Nearer Spain by a peasant of the Termestine tribe

 ac pernicitate equi profugus , postquam saltuosos locos attigerat , dimisso equo per derupta et avia sequentis frustratus est$$ He then fled on a swift horse ,  and reached a wooded country ,  where he parted with his steed and eluded pursuit amid rocky and pathless wilds
 neque diu fefellit$$ But he was soon discovered
 nam prenso ductoque per proximos pagos equo cuius foret cognitum$$ The horse was caught and led through the neighbouring villages ,  and its owner ascertained
 et repertus cum tormentis edere conscios adigeretur , voce magna sermones patrio frustra se interrogari clamitavit$$ Being found and put to the torture that he might be forced to reveal his accomplices ,  he exclaimed in a loud voice ,  in the language of his country ,  that it was in vain to question him
 adsisterent socii ac spectarent nullam vim tantam doloris fore ut veritatem eliceret$$ his comrades might stand by and look on ,  but that the most intense agony would not wring the truth from him
 idemque cum postero ad quaestionem retraheretur , eo nisu proripuit se custodibus saxoque caput adflixit ut statim exanimaretur$$ Next day ,  when he was dragged back to torture ,  he broke loose from his guards and dashed his head against a stone with such violence that he instantly fell dead
 sed Piso Termestinorum dolo caesus habetur$$ It was however believed that Piso was treacherously murdered by the Termestini
 quippe pecunias e publico interceptas acrius quam ut tolerarent barbari cogebat$$ Some public money had been embezzled ,  and he was pressing for its payment too rigorously for the patience of barbarians
 Lentulo Gaetulico Gaius Calvisio consulibus decreta triumphi insignia Poppaeo Sabino contusis Thraecum gentibus , qui montium editis incultu atque eo ferocius agitabant$$ In the consulship of Lentulus Gaetulicus and Caius Calvisius ,  triumphal distinctions were decreed to Poppaeus Sabinus ,  for a crushing defeat of some Thracian tribes ,  whose wild life in the highlands of a mountainous country made them unusually fierce
 causa motus super hominum ingenium , quod pati dilectus et validissimum quemque militiae nostrae dare aspernabantor , ne regibus quidem parere nisi ex libidine soliti , aut si mitterent auxilia , suos ductores praeficere nec nisi adversum accolas belligerare$$ Besides their natural ferocity ,  the rebellion had its origin in their scornful refusal to endure levies and to supply our armies with their bravest men Even native princes they would obey only according to their caprice ,  and if they sent aid ,  they used to appoint their own leaders and fight only against their neighbours
 ac tum rumor incesserat fore ut disiecti aliisque nationibus permixti diversas in terras traherentur$$ A rumour had then spread itself among them that ,  dispersed and mingled with other tribes ,  they were to be dragged away to distant countries
 sed antequam arma inciperent , misere legatos amicitiam obsequiumque memoraturos , et mansura haec si nullo novo onere temptarentur$$ Before however they took up arms ,  they sent envoys with assurances of their friendship and loyalty ,  which ,  they said ,  would continue ,  if they were not tried by any fresh burden
 sin ut victis servitium indiceretur , esse sibi ferrum et iuventutem et promptum libertati aut ad mortem animum$$ But if they were doomed to slavery as a conquered people ,  they had swords and young warriors and a spirit bent on freedom or resigned to death
 simul castella rupibus indita conlatosque illuc parentes et coniuges ostentabant bellumque impeditum arduum cruentum minitabantur$$ As they spoke ,  they pointed to fortresses amid rocks whither they had conveyed their parents and their wives ,  and threatened us with a difficult ,  dangerous and sanguinary war
 At Sabinus , donec exercitus in unum conduceret , datis mitibus responsis , postquam Pomponius Labeo e Moesia cum legione , rex Rhoemetalces cum auxiliis popularium qui fidem non mutaverant , venere , addita praesenti copia ad hostem pergit , compositum iam per angustias saltuum$$ Sabinus meantime ,  while he was concentrating his troops ,  returned gentle answers but on the arrival of Pomponius Labeo with a legion from Moesia and of king Rhoemetalces with some reinforcements from his subjects ,  who had not thrown off their allegiance ,  with these and the force he had on the spot ,  he advanced on the enemy ,  who were drawn up in some wooded defiles
 quidam audentius apertis in collibus visebantur , quos dux Romanus acie suggressus haud aegre pepulit sanguine barbarorum modico ob propinqua suffugia$$ Some ventured to show themselves on the open hills these the Roman general approached in fighting order and easily dislodged them ,  with only a small slaughter of the barbarians ,  who had not far to flee
 mox castris in loco communitis valida manu montem occupat angustum et aequali dorso continuum usque ad proximum castellum quod magna vis armata aut incondita tuebatur$$ In this position he soon established a camp ,  and held with a strong detachment a narrow and unbroken mountain ridge ,  stretching as far as the next fortress ,  which was garrisoned by a large force of armed soldiers along with some irregulars
 simul in ferocissimos , qui ante vallum more gentis cum carminibus et tripudiis persultabant , mittit delectos sagittariorum ii dum eminus grassabantur crebra et inulta vulnera fecere$$ Against the boldest of these ,  who after the manner of their country were disporting themselves with songs and dances in front of the rampart ,  he sent some picked archers ,  who ,  discharging distant volleys ,  inflicted many wounds without loss to themselves
 propius incedentes eruptione subita turbati sunt receptique subsidio Sugambrae cohortis , quam Romanus promptam ad pericula nec minus cantuum et armorum tumultu trucem haud procul instruxerat$$ As they advanced ,  a sudden sortie put them to the rout ,  and they fell back on the support of a Sugambrian cohort ,  drawn up at no great distance by the Roman general ,  ready for any emergency and as terrible as the foe ,  with the noise of their war songs and the clashing of their arms
 Rebusque turbatis malum extremum discordia accessit , his deditionem aliis mortem et mutuos inter se ictus parantibus et erant qui non inultum exitium sed eruptionem suaderent neque ignobiles tantum his diversi sententiis , verum e ducibus Dinis , provectus senecta et longo usu vim atque clementiam Romanam edoctus , ponenda arma , unum adflictis id remedium disserebat , primusque secum coniuge et liberis victori permisit$$ One of their chiefs ,  Dinis ,  an old man who well knew by long experience both the strength and clemency of Rome ,  maintained that they must lay down their arms ,  this being the only remedy for their wretched plight ,  and he was the first to give himself up with his wife and children to the conqueror He was followed by all whom age or sex unfitted for war ,  by all too who had a stronger love of life than of renown
 secuti aetate aut sexu imbecilli et quibus maior vitae quam gloriae cupido$$ The young were divided between Tarsa and Turesis ,  both of whom had resolved to fall together with their freedom
 at iuventus Tarsam inter et Turesim distrahebatur utrique destinatum cum libertate occidere , sed Tarsa properum finem , abrumpendas pariter spes ac metus clamitans , dedit exemplum demisso in pectus ferro$$ Tarsa however kept urging them to speedy death and to the instant breaking off of all hope and fear ,  and ,  by way of example ,  plunged his sword into his heart And there were some who chose the same death
 nec defuere qui eodem modo oppeterent$$ Turesis and his band waited for night ,  not without the knowledge of our general
 Turesis sua cum manu noctem opperitur haud nescio duce nostro$$ Consequently ,  the sentries were strengthened with denser masses of troops
 igitur firmatae stationes densioribus globis et ingruebat nox nimbo atrox , hostisque clamore turbido , modo per vastum silentium , incertos obsessores effecerat , cum Sabinus circumire , hortari , ne ad ambigua sonitus aut simulationem quietis casum insidiantibus aperirent , sed sua quisque munia servarent immoti telisque non in falsum iactis$$ Night was coming on with a fierce storm ,  and the foe ,  one moment with a tumultuous uproar ,  another in awful silence ,  had perplexed the besiegers ,  when Sabinus went round the camp ,  entreating the men not to give a chance to their stealthy assailants by heeding embarrassing noises or being deceived by quiet ,  but to keep ,  every one ,  to his post without moving or discharging their darts on false alarms
 Interea barbari catervis decurrentes nunc in vallum manualia saxa , praeustas sudes , decisa robora iacere , nunc virgultis et cratibus et corporibus exanimis complere fossas , quidam pontis et scalas ante fabricati inferre propugnaculis eaque prensare , detrahere et adversum resistentis comminus niti$$ The barbarians meanwhile rushed down with their bands ,  now hurling at the entrenchments stones such as the hand could grasp ,  stakes with points hardened by fire ,  and boughs lopped from oaks now filling up the fosses with bushes and hurdles and dead bodies ,  while others advanced up to the breastwork with bridges and ladders which they had constructed for the occasion ,  seized it ,  tore it down ,  and came to close quarters with the defenders
 miles contra deturbare telis , pellere umbonibus , muralia pila , congestas lapidum molis provolvere$$ Our soldiers on the other side drove them back with missiles ,  repelled them with their shields ,  and covered them with a storm of long siege-javelins and heaps of stones
 his partae victoriae spes et si cedant insignitius flagitium , illis extrema iam salus et adsistentes plerisque matres et coniuges earumque lamenta addunt animos$$ Success already gained and the more marked disgrace which would follow repulse ,  were a stimulus to the Romans ,  while the courage of the foe was heightened by this last chance of deliverance and the presence of many mothers and wives with mournful cries
 nox aliis in audaciam , aliis ad formidinem opportuna incerti ictus , vulnera improvisa suorum atque hostium ignoratio et montis anfractu repercussae velut a tergo voces adeo cuncta miscuerant ut quaedam munimenta Romani quasi perrupta omiserint$$ Darkness ,  which increased the daring of some and the terror of others ,  random blows ,  wounds not foreseen ,  failure to recognise friend or enemy ,  echoes ,  seemingly in their rear ,  from the winding mountain valleys ,  spread such confusion that the Romans abandoned some of their lines in the belief that they had been stormed
 neque tamen pervasere hostes nisi admodum pauci$$ Only however a very few of the enemy had broken through them
 ceteros , deiecto promptissimo quoque aut saucio , adpetente iam luce trusere in summa castelli ubi tandem coacta deditio$$ the rest ,  after their bravest men had been beaten back or wounded ,  were towards daybreak pushed back to the upper part of the fortress and there at last compelled to surrender

 reliquis quo minus vi aut obsidio subigerentur praematura montis Haemi et saeva hiems subvenit$$ The early and severe winter of Mount Haemus saved the rest of the population from being reduced by assault or blockade

 se imaginem veram , caelesti sanguine ortam , intellegere discrimen , suscipere sordis$$ here is the true image ,  sprung of heavenly blood ,  and she perceives her danger ,  and assumes its mournful emblems
 frustra Pulchram praescribi cui sola exitii causa sit quod Agrippinam stulte prorsus ad cultum delegerit oblita Sosiae ob eadem adflictae$$ Pulchra's name is a mere blind the only reason for her destruction is that she has ,  in utter folly ,  selected Agrippina for her admiration ,  forgetting that Sosia was thereby ruined
 audita haec raram occulti pectoris vocem elicuere , correptamque Graeco versu admonuit non ideo laedi quia non regnaret$$ These words wrung from the emperor one of the rare utterances of that inscrutable breast
 Pulchra et Furnius damnantur$$ he rebuked Agrippina with a Greek verse ,  and reminded her that she was not wronged because she was not a queen
 Afer primoribus oratorum additus , divulgato ingenio et secuta adseveratione Caesaris qua suo iure disertum eum appellavit$$ Pulchra and Furnius were condemned Afer was ranked with the foremost orators ,  for the ability which he displayed ,  and which won strong praise from Tiberius ,  who pronounced him a speaker of natural genius
 mox capessendis accusationibus aut reos tutando prosperiore eloquentiae quam morum fama fuit , nisi quod aetas extrema multum etiam eloquentiae dempsit , dum fessa mente retinet silentii impatientiam$$ Henceforward as a counsel for the defence or the prosecution he enjoyed the fame of eloquence rather than of virtue ,  but old age robbed him of much of his speaking power ,  while ,  with a failing intellect ,  he was still impatient of silence
 At Agrippina pervicax irae et morbo corporis implicata , cum viseret eam Caesar , profusis diu ac per silentium lacrimis , mox invidiam et preces orditur$$ Agrippina in stubborn rage ,  with the grasp of disease yet on her ,  when the emperor came to see her ,  wept long and silently ,  and then began to mingle reproach and supplication
 subveniret solitudini , daret maritum$$ She begged him to relieve her loneliness and provide her with a husband
 habilem adhuc inventam sibi neque aliud probis quam ex matrimonio solacium esse in civitate , * * * Germanici coniugem ac liberos eius recipere dignarentur$$ her youth still fitted her for marriage ,  which was a virtuous woman's only solace ,  and there were citizens in Rome who would not disdain to receive the wife of Germanicus and his children
 sed Caesar non ignarus quantum ex re publica peteretur , ne tamen offensionis aut metus manifestus foret sine responso quamquam instantem reliquit$$ But the emperor ,  who perceived the political aims of her request ,  but did not wish to show displeasure or apprehension ,  left her ,  notwithstanding her urgency ,  without an answer
 id ego , a scriptoribus annalium non traditum , repperi in commentariis Agrippinae filiae quae Neronis principis mater vitam suam et casus suorum posteris memoravit$$ This incident ,  not mentioned by any historian ,  I have found in the memoirs of the younger Agrippina ,  the mother of the emperor Nero ,  who handed down to posterity the story of her life and of the misfortunes of her family
 At Zmymaei repetita vetustate , seu Tantalus Iove ortus illos , sive Theseus divina et ipse stirpe , sive una Amazonum condidisset , transcendere ad ea , quis maxime fidebant , in populum Romanum officiis , missa navali copia non modo externa ad bella sed quae in Italia tolerabantur$$ The envoys from Smyrna ,  after tracing their city's antiquity back to such founders as either Tantalus ,  the son of Jupiter ,  or Theseus ,  also of divine origin ,  or one of the Amazons ,  passed on to that on which they chiefly relied ,  their services to the Roman people ,  whom they had helped with naval armaments ,  not only in wars abroad ,  but in those under which we struggled in Italy
 seque primos templum urbis Romae statuisse , Marcus Porcio consule , magnis quidem iam populi Romani rebus , nondum tamen ad summum elatis , stante adhuc Punica urbe et validis per Asiam regibus$$ They had also been the first ,  they said ,  to build a temple in honour of Rome ,  during the consulship of Marcus Porcius Cato ,  when Rome's power indeed was great ,  but not yet raised to the highest point ,  inasmuch as the Punic capital was still standing and there were mighty kings in Asia
 simul Lucius Sullam testem adferebant , gravissimo in discrimine exercitus ob asperitatem hiemis et penuriam vestis , cum id Zmyrnam in contionem nuntiatum foret , omnis qui adstabant detraxisse corpori tegmina nostrisque legionibus misisse$$ They appealed too to the of Lucius Sulla ,  whose army was once in terrible jeopardy from a severe winter and want of clothing ,  and this having been announced at Smyrna in a public assembly ,  all who were present stript their clothes off their backs and sent them to our legions
 ita rogati sententiam patres Zmyrnaeos praetulere$$ And so the Senate ,  when the question was put ,  gave the preference to Smyrna
 censuitque Vibius Marsus ut M Lepido , cui ea provincia obvenerat , super numerum legaretur qui templi curam susciperet$$ Vibius Marsus moved that Marcus Lepidus ,  to whom the province of Asia had been assigned ,  should have under him a special commissioner to undertake the charge of this temple
 et quia Lepidus ipse deligere per modestiam abnuebat , Valerius Naso e praetoriis sorte missus est$$ As Lepidus himself ,  out of modesty ,  declined to appoint ,  Valerius Naso ,  one of the ex-praetors ,  was chosen by lot and sent out
 Inter quae diu meditato prolatoque saepius consilio tandem Caesar in Campaniam , specie dedicandi templa apud Capuam Iovi , apud Nolam Augusto , sed certus procul urbe degere$$ Meanwhile ,  after long reflection on his purpose and frequent deferment of it ,  the emperor retired into Campania to dedicate ,  as he pretended ,  a temple to Jupiter at Capua and another to Augustus at Nola ,  but really resolved to live at a distance from Rome
 causam abscessus quamquam secutus plurimos auctorum ad Seiani artes rettuli , quia tamen caede eius patrata sex postea annos pari secreto conionxit , plerumque permoveor num ad ipsum referri verius sit , saevitiam ac libidinem cum factis promeret , locis occultantem erant qui crederent in senectute corporis quoque habitum pudori fuisse$$ Although I have followed most historians in attributing the cause of his retirement to the arts of Sejanus ,  still ,  as he passed six consecutive years in the same solitude after that minister's destruction ,  I am often in doubt whether it is not to be more truly ascribed to himself ,  and his wish to hide by the place of his retreat the cruelty and licentiousness which he betrayed by his actions Some thought that in his old age he was ashamed of his personal appearance
 quippe illi praegracilis et incurva proceritas , nudus capillo vertex , ulcerosa facies ac plerumque medicaminibus interstincta$$ He had indeed a tall ,  singularly slender and stooping figure ,  a bald head ,  a face full of eruptions ,  and covered here and there with plasters

 traditur etiam matris impotentia extrusum quam dominationis sociam aspernabatur neque depellere poterat , cum dominationem ipsam donum eius accepisset$$ According to one account his mother's domineering temper drove him away he was weary of having her as his partner in power ,  and he could not thrust her aside ,  because he had received this very power as her gift
 nam dubitaverat Augustus Germanicum , sororis nepotem et cunctis laudatum , rei Romanae imponere , sed precibus usoris evictus Tiberio Germanicum , sibi Tiberium adscivit$$ For Augustus had had thoughts of putting the Roman state under Germanicus ,  his sister's grandson ,  whom all men esteemed ,  but yielding to his wife's entreaties he left Germanicus to be adopted by Tiberius and adopted Tiberius himself
 idque Augusta exprobrabat , reposcebat$$ With this Augusta would taunt her son ,  and claim back what she had given

 ferebant periti caelestium iis motibus siderum excessisse Roma Tiberium ut reditus illi negaretur$$ It was said by men who knew the stars that the motions of the heavenly bodies when Tiberius left Rome were such as to forbid the possibility of his return
 unde exitii causa multis fuit properum finem vitae coniectantibus vulgantibusque$$ This caused ruin for many who conjectured that his end was near and spread the rumour
 neque enim tam incredibilem casum providebant ut undecim per annos libens patria careret$$ for they never foresaw the very improbable contingency of his voluntary exile from his home for eleven years
 mox patuit breve confinium artis et falsi veraque quam obscuris tegerentur$$ Soon afterwards it was clearly seen what a narrow margin there is between such science and delusion and in what obscurity truth is veiled
 nam in urbem non regressurum haud forte dictum$$ That he would not return to Rome was not a mere random assertion
 ceterorum nescii egere , cum propinquo rure aut litore et saepe moenia urbis adsidens extremam senectam compleverit$$ as to the rest ,  they were wholly in the dark ,  seeing that he lived to extreme old age in the country or on the coast near Rome and often close to the very walls of the city
 Ac forte illis diebus oblatum Caesari anceps periculum auxit vana rumoris praebuitque ipsi materiem cur amicitiae constantiaeque Seiani magis fideret$$ It happened at this time that a perilous accident which occurred to the emperor strengthened vague rumours and gave him grounds for trusting more fully in the friendship and fidelity of Sejanus
 vescebantur in villa cui vocabulum Speluncae mare Amunclanum inter et Fundanos montis nativo in specu$$ They were dining in a country house called The Cave ,  between the gulf of Amuclae and the hills of Fundi ,  in a natural grotto
 eius os lapsis repente saxis obruit quosdam ministros$$ The rocks at its entrance suddenly fell in and crushed some of the attendants
 hinc metus in omnis et fuga eorum qui convivium celebrabant$$ there upon panic seized the whole company and there was a general flight of the guests
 Seianus genu voltuque et manibus super Caesarem suspensus opposuit sese incidentibus atque habitu tali repertus est a militibus qui subsidio venerant$$ Sejanus hung over the emperor ,  and with knee ,  face ,  and hand encountered the falling stones and was found in this attitude by the soldiers who came to their rescue
 maior ex eo et quamquam exitiosa suaderet ut non sui anxius cum fide audiebatur$$ After this he was greater than ever ,  and though his counsels were ruinous ,  he was listened to with confidence ,  as a man who had no care for himself
 adsimulabatque iudicis partis adversum Germanici stirpem , subditis qui accusatorum nomina sustinerent maximeque insectarentur Neronem proximum successioni et , quamquam modesta iuventa , plerumque tamen quid in praesentiarum conduceret oblitum , dum a libertis et clientibus , apiscendae potentiae properis , extimulator ut erectum et fidentem animi ostenderet velle id populum Romanum , cupere exercitus , neque ausurum contra Seianum qui nunc patientiam senis et segnitiam iuvenis iuxta insultet$$ He pretended to act as a judge towards the children of Germanicus ,  after having suborned persons to assume the part of prosecutors and to inveigh specially against Nero ,  next in succession to the throne ,  who ,  though he had proper youthful modesty ,  often forgot present expediency ,  while freedmen and clients ,  eager to get power ,  incited him to display vigour and self-confidence This ,  they said ,  was what the Roman people wished ,  what the armies desired ,  and Sejanus would not dare to oppose it ,  though now he insulted alike the tame spirit of the old emperor and the timidity of the young prince
 Haec atque talia audienti nihil quidempravae cogitationis , sed interdum voces procedebant contumaces et inconsultae , quas adpositi custodes exceptas auctasque cum deferrent neque Neroni defendere daretur , diversae insuper sollicitudinum formae oriebantur$$ Nero ,  while he listened to this and like talk ,  was not indeed inspired with any guilty ambition ,  but still occasionally there would break from him wilful and thoughtless expressions which spies about his person caught up and reported with exaggeration ,  and this he had no opportunity of rebutting
 nam alius occursum eius vitare , quidam salutatione reddita statim averti , plerique inceptum sermonem abrumpere , insistentibus contra inridentibusque qui Seiano fautores aderant$$ Then again alarms under various forms were continually arising One man would avoid meeting him another after returning his salutation would instantly turn away many after beginning a conversation would instantly break it off ,  while Sejanus's friends would stand their ground and laugh at him
 enimvero Tiberius torvus aut falsum renidens vultu$$ Tiberius indeed wore an angry frown or a treacherous smile
 seu loqueretur seu taceret iuvenis , crimen ex silentio , ex voce$$ Whether the young prince spoke or held his tongue ,  silence and speech were alike criminal
 ne nox quidem secura , cum uxor vigilias somnos suspiria matri Liviae atque illa Seiano patefaceret$$ Every night had its anxieties ,  for his sleepless hours ,  his dreams and sighs were all made known by his wife to her mother Livia and by Livia to Sejanus
 qui fratrem quoque Neronis Drusum traxit in partis , spe obiecta principis loci si priorem aetate et iam labefactum demovisset$$ Nero's brother Drusus Sejanus actually drew into his scheme by holding out to him the prospect of becoming emperor through the removal of an elder brother ,  already all but fallen
 atrox Drusi ingenium super cupidinem potentiae et solita fratribus odia accendebatur invidia quod mater Agrippina promptior Neroni erat$$ The savage temper of Drusus ,  to say nothing of lust of power and the usual feuds between brothers ,  was inflamed with envy by the partiality of the mother Agrippina towards Nero
 neque tamen Seianus ita Drusum fovabat ut non in eum quoque semina futuri exitii meditaretur , gnarus praeferocem et insidiis magis opportunum$$ And yet Sejanus ,  while he favoured Drusus ,  was not without thoughts of sowing the seeds of his future ruin ,  well knowing how very impetuous he was and therefore the more exposed to treachery
 Fine anni excessere insignes viri Asinius Agrippa , claris maioribus quam vetustis vitaque non degener , et Quintus Haterius , familia senatoria , eloquentiae quoad vixit celebratae monimenta ingeni eius haud perinde retinentur scilicet impetu magis quam cura vigebat$$ Towards the close of the year died two distinguished men ,  Asinius Agrippa and Quintus Haterius Agrippa was of illustrious rather than ancient ancestry ,  which his career did not disgrace Haterius was of a senatorian family and famous for his eloquence while he lived ,  though the monuments which remain of his genius are not admired as of old
 utque aliorum meditatio et labor in posterum valescit , sic Haterii canorum illud et profluens cum ipso simul extinctum est$$ The truth is he succeeded more by vehemence than by finish of style While the research and labours of other authors are valued by an after age ,  the harmonious fluency of Haterius died with him
 Marcus Licinio Lucius Calpurnio consulibus ingentium bellorum cladem aequavit malum improvisum$$ In the year of the consulship of Marcus Licinius and Lucius Calpurnius ,  the losses of a great war were matched by an unexpected disaster ,  no sooner begun than ended
 eius initium simul et finis extitit nam coepto apud Fidenam amphitheatro Atilius quidam libertini generis , quo spectaculum gladiatorum celebraret , neque fundamenta per solidum subdidit neque firmis nexibus ligneam compagem superstruxit , ut qui non abundantia pecuniae nec municipali ambitione sed in sordidam mercedem id negotium quaesivisset$$ One Atilius ,  of the freedman class ,  having undertaken to build an amphitheatre at Fidena for the exhibition of a show of gladiators ,  failed to lay a solid foundation to frame the wooden superstructure with beams of sufficient strength for he had neither an abundance of wealth ,  nor zeal for public popularity ,  but he had simply sought the work for sordid gain Thither flocked all who loved such sights and who during the reign of Tiberius had been wholly debarred from such amusements
 adfluxere avidi talium , imperitante Tiberio procul voluptatibus habiti , virile ac muliebre secus , omnis aetas , ob propinquitatem loci effusius$$ men and women of every age crowding to the place because it was near Rome And so the calamity was all the more fatal
 unde gravior pestis fuit , conferta mole , dein convulsa , dum ruit intus aut in exteriora effunditur immensamque vim mortalium , spectaculo intentos aut qui circum adstabant , praeceps trahit atque operit$$ The building was densely crowded then came a violent shock ,  as it fell inwards or spread outwards ,  precipitating and burying an immense multitude which was intently gazing on the show or standing round
 et illi quidem quos principium stragis in mortem adflixerat , ut tali sorte , cruciatum effugere$$ Those who were crushed to death in the first moment of the accident had at least under such dreadful circumstances the advantage of escaping torture
 miserandi magis quos abrupta parte corporis nondum vita deseruerat qui per diem visu , per noctem ululatibus et gemitu coniuges aut liberos noscebant$$ More to be pitied were they who with limbs torn from them still retained life ,  while they recognised their wives and children by seeing them during the day and by hearing in the night their screams and groans
 iam ceteri fama exciti , hic fratrem , propinquum ille , alius parentes lamentari$$ Soon all the neighbours in their excitement at the report were bewailing brothers ,  kinsmen or parents
 etiam quorum diversa de causa amici aut necessarii aberant , pavere tamen nequedum comperto quos illa vis perculisset , latior ex incerto metus$$ Even those whose friends or relatives were away from home for quite a different reason ,  still trembled for them ,  and as it was not yet known who had been destroyed by the crash ,  suspense made the alarm more widespread
 Nondum ea clades exoleverat cum ignis violentia urbem ultra solitum adfecit , deusto monte Caelio$$ This disaster was not forgotten when a furious conflagration damaged the capital to an unusual extent ,  reducing Mount Caelius to ashes
 feralemque annum ferebant et ominibus adversis susceptum principi consilium absentiae , qui mos vulgo , fortuita ad culpam trahentes , ni Caesar obviam isset tribuendo pecunias ex modo detrimenti$$ It was an ill-starred year ,  people began to say ,  and the emperor's purpose of leaving Rome must have been formed under evil omens They began in vulgar fashion to trace ill-luck to guilt ,  when Tiberius checked them by distributing money in proportion to losses sustained
 actaeque ei grates apud senatum ab inlustribus famaque apud populum , quia sine ambitione aut proximorum precibus ignotos etiam et ultro accitos munificentia iuverat$$ He received a vote of thanks in the Senate from its distinguished members ,  and was applauded by the populace for having assisted with his liberality ,  without partiality or the solicitations of friends ,  strangers whom he had himself sought out
 adduntur sententiae ut mons Caelius in posterum Augustus appellaretur , quando cunctis circum flagrantibus sola Tiberii effigies sita in domo Iunii senatoris inviolata mansisset$$ And proposals were also made that Mount Caelius should for the future be called Mount Augustus ,  inasmuch as when all around was in flames only a single statue of Tiberius in the house of one Junius ,  a senator ,  had remained uninjured
 evenisse id olim Claudiae Quintae eiusque statuam vim ignium bis elapsam maiores apud aedem matris deum consecravisse$$ This ,  it was said ,  had formerly happened to Claudia Quinta her statue ,  which had twice escaped the violence of fire ,  had been dedicated by our ancestors in the temple of the Mother of Gods
 sanctos acceptosque numinibus Claudios et augendam caerimoniam loco in quo tantum in principem honorem di ostenderint$$ hence the Claudii had been accounted sacred and numbered among deities ,  and so additional sanctity ought to be given to a spot where heaven showed such honour to the emperor
 At Caesar dedicatis per Campaniam templis , quamquam edicto monuisset ne quis quietem eius inrumperet , concursusque oppidanorum disposito milite prohiberentur , perosus tamen municipia et colonias omniaque in continenti sita Capreas se in insulam abdidit trium milium freto ab extremis Surrentini promunturii diiunctam$$ Caesar ,  meanwhile ,  after dedicating the temples in Campania ,  warned the public by an edict not to disturb his retirement and posted soldiers here and there to keep off the throngs of townsfolk But he so loathed the towns and colonies and ,  in short ,  every place on the mainland ,  that he buried himself in the island of Capreae which is separated by three miles of strait from the extreme point of the promontory of Sorrentum
 solitudinem eius placuisse maxime crediderim , quoniam importuosum circa mare et vix modicis navigiis pauca subsidia$$ The solitude of the place was ,  I believe ,  its chief attraction ,  for a harbourless sea surrounds it and even for a small vessel it has but few safe retreats ,  nor can any one land unknown to the sentries
 neque adpulerit quisquam nisi gnaro custode$$ Its air in winter is soft ,  as it is screened by a mountain which is a protection against cutting winds
 caeli temperies hieme mitis obiectu montis quo saeva ventorum arcentur$$ In summer it catches the western breezes ,  and the open sea round it renders it most delightful
 aestas in favonium obversa et aperto circum pelago peramoena$$ It commanded too a prospect of the most lovely bay ,  till Vesuvius ,  bursting into flames ,  changed the face of the country
 prospectabatque pulcherrimum sinum , antequam Vesuvius mons ardescens faciem loci verteret$$ Greeks ,  so tradition says ,  occupied those parts and Capreae was inhabited by the Teleboi
 Graecos ea tenuisse Capreasque Telebois habitatas fama tradit$$ Tiberius had by this time filled the island with twelve country houses ,  each with a grand name and a vast structure of its own
 sed tum Tiberius duodecim villarum nominibus et molibus insederat , quanto intentus olim publicas ad curas tanto occultiores in luxus et malum otium resolutus$$ Intent as he had once been on the cares of state ,  he was now for thoroughly unbending himself in secret profligacy and a leisure of malignant schemes
 manebat quippe suspicionum et credendi temeritas quam Seianus augere etiam in urbe suetus acrius turbabat non iam occultis adversum Agrippinam et Neronem insidiis$$ For he still retained that rash proneness to suspect and to believe ,  which even at Rome Sejanus used to foster ,  and which he here excited more keenly ,  no longer concealing his machinations against Agrippina and Nero
 quis additus miles nuntios , introitus , aperta secreta velut in annalis referebat , ultroque struebantur qui monerent perfugere ad Germaniae exercitus vel celeberrimo fori effigiem divi Augusti amplecti populumque ac senatum auxilio vocare$$ Soldiers hung about them ,  and every message ,  every visit ,  their public and their private life were I may say regularly chronicled And persons were actually suborned to advise them to flee to the armies of Germany ,  or when the Forum was most crowded ,  to clasp the statue of statue of the Divine Augustus and appeal to the protection of the people and Senate
 eaque spreta ab illis , velut pararent , obiciebantur$$ These counsels they disdained ,  but they were charged with having had thoughts of acting on them
 Consultant quos memoravi quonam modo ea plurium auditu acciperentur$$ The men whom I have named now consulted how these conversations might fall within the hearing of more persons
 nam loco in quem coibatur servanda solitudinis facies et si pone foris adsisterent , metus visus , sonitus aut forte ortae suspicionis erat$$ It was necessary that the place of meeting should preserve the appearance of secrecy ,  and ,  if witnesses were to stand behind the doors ,  there was a fear of their being seen or heard ,  or of suspicion casually arising
 tectum inter et laquearia tres senatores haud minus turpi latebra quam detestanda fraude sese abstrudunt , foraminibus et rimis aurem admovent$$ Three senators thrust themselves into the space between the roof and ceiling ,  a hiding-place as shameful as the treachery was execrable
 interea Latiaris repertum in publico Sabinum , velut recens cognita narraturus , domum et in cubiculum trahit praeteritaque et instantia , quorum adfatim copia , ac novos terrores cumulat$$ They applied their ears to apertures and crevices Latiaris meanwhile having met Sabinus in the streets ,  drew him to his house and to the room ,  as if he was going to communicate some fresh discoveries
 eadem ille et s diutius , quanto maesta , ubi semel prorupere , difficilius reticentur$$ There he talked much about past and impending troubles ,  a copious topic indeed ,  and about fresh horrors
 properata inde accusatio missisque ad Caesarem litteris ordinem fraudis suumque ipsi dedecus narravere$$ Sabinus spoke as before and at greater length ,  as sorrow ,  when once it has broken into utterance ,  is the harder to restrain
 non alias magis anxia et pavens civitas , tegens adversum proximos$$ Instantly they hastened to accuse him ,  and having despatched a letter to the emperor ,  they informed him of the order of the plot and of their own infamy
 congressus , conloquia , notae ignotaeque aures vitari$$ Never was Rome more distracted and terror-stricken
 etiam muta atque inanima , tectum et parietes circumspectabantur$$ Meetings ,  conversations ,  the ear of friend and stranger were alike shunned
 Sed Caesar sollemnia incipientis anni kalendis Ianuariis epistula precatus vertit in Sabinum , corruptos quosdam libertorum et petitum se arguens , ultionemque haud obscure poscebat$$ The emperor in his letter on the first of January ,  after offering the usual prayers for the new year ,  referred to Sabinus ,  whom he reproached with having corrupted some of his freedmen and having attempted his life ,  and he claimed vengeance in no obscure language
 nec mora quin decerneretur et trahebatur damnatus , quantum obducta veste et adstrictis faucibus niti poterat , clamitans sic inchoari annum , has Seiano victimas cadere$$ It was decreed without hesitation ,  and the condemned man was dragged off ,  exclaiming as loudly as he could ,  with head covered and throat tightly bound ,  that this was inaugurating the year
 quo intendisset oculos , quo verba acciderent , fuga vastitas , deseri itinera fora$$ these were the victims slain to Sejanus Wherever he turned his eyes ,  wherever his words fell ,  there was flight and solitude
 et quidam regrediebantur ostentabantque se rursum id ipsum paventes quod timuissent$$ the streets and public places were forsaken
 quem enim diem vacuum poena ubi inter sacra et vota , quo tempore verbis etiam profanis abstineri mos esset , vincla et laqueus inducantur$$ A few retraced their steps and again showed themselves ,  shuddering at the mere fact that they had betrayed alarm
 non imprudentem Tiberium tantam invidiam adisse quaesitum meditatumque , ne quid impedire credatur quo minus novi magistratus , quo modo delubra et altaria , sic carcerem recludant$$ What day ,  they asked ,  will be without some execution ,  when amid sacrifices and prayers ,  a time when it is usual to refrain even from a profane word ,  the chain and halter are introduced
 secutae insuper litterae grates agentis quod hominem infensum rei publicae punivissent , adiecto trepidam sibi vitam , suspectas inimicorum insidias , nullo nominatim compellato$$ Tiberius has not incurred such odium blindly this is a studied device to make us believe that there is no reason why the new magistrates should not open the dungeons as well as the temple and the altars
 neque tamen dubitabatur in Neronem et Agrippinam intendi$$ Thereupon there came a letter of thanks to them for having punished a bitter foe to the State ,  and the emperor further added that he had an anxious life ,  that he apprehended treachery from enemies ,  but he mentioned no one by name
 Ni mihi destinatum foret suum quaeque in annum referre , avebat animus antire statimque memorare exitus quos Latinus atque Opsius ceterique flagitii eius repertores habuere , non modo postquam Gaius Caesar rerum potitus est sed incolumi Tiberio , qui scelerum ministros ut perverti ab aliis nolebat , ita plerumque satiatus et oblatis in eandem operam recentibus veteres et praegravis adflixit$$ But for my plan of referring each event to its own year ,  I should feel a strong impulse to anticipate matters and at once relate the deaths by which Latinius and Opsius and the other authors of this atrocious deed perished ,  some after Caius became emperor ,  some even while Tiberius yet ruled For although he would not have the instruments of his wickedness destroyed by others ,  he frequently ,  when he was tired of them ,  and fresh ones offered themselves for the same services ,  flung off the old ,  now become a mere incubus
 verum has atque alias sontium poenas in tempore trademus$$ But these and other punishments of guilty men I shall describe in due course
 tum censuit Asinius Gallus , cuius liberorum Agrippina matertera erat , petendum a principe ut metus suos senatui fateretur amoverique sineret$$ Asinius Gallus ,  to whose children Agrippina was aunt ,  then moved that the emperor should be requested to disclose his apprehensions to the Senate and allow their removal
 nullam acque Tiberius , ut rebatur , ex virtutibus suis quam dissimulationem diligebat$$ Of all his virtues ,  as he counted them ,  there was none on which Tiberius so prided himself as his ability to dissemble ,  and he was therefore the more irritated at an attempt to expose what he was hiding
 eo aegrius accepit recludi quae premeret sed mitigavit Seianus , non Galli amore verum ut cunctationes principis opperiretur , gnarus lentum in meditando , ubi prorupisset , tristibus dictis atrocia facta coniungere$$ Sejanus however pacified him ,  not out of love for Gallus ,  but rather to wait the result of the emperor's wavering mood ,  knowing ,  as he did ,  that ,  though slow in forming his purpose ,  yet having once broken through his reserve ,  he would follow up harsh words with terrible deeds
 Per idem tempus Iulia mortem obiit , quam neptem Augustus convictam adulterii damnaverat proieceratque in insulam Trimentm , haud procul Apulis litoribus$$ About the same time Julia died ,  the granddaughter of Augustus He had condemned her on a conviction of adultery and had banished her to the island of Trimerus ,  not far from the shores of Apulia
 illic viginti annis exilium toleravit Augustae ope sustentata , quae florentis privignos cum per occultum subvertisset , misericordiam erga adflictos palam ostentabat$$ There she endured a twenty years' exile ,  in which she was supported by relief from Augusta ,  who having overthrown the prosperity of her step-children by secret machinations ,  made open display of her compassion to the fallen family
 Clarum inde inter Germanos Frisium nomen , dissimulante Tiberio damna ne cui bellum permitteret$$ The Frisian name thus became famous in Germany ,  and Tiberius kept our losses a secret ,  not wishing to entrust any one with the war
 neque senatus in eo cura an imperii extrema dehonestarentur$$ Nor did the Senate care whether dishonour fell on the extreme frontiers of the empire
 pavor internus occupaverat animos cui remedium adulatione quaerebatur$$ Fear at home had filled their hearts ,  and for this they sought relief in sycophancy
 ita quamquam diversis super rebus consulerentur , aram clementiae , aram amicitiae effigiesque circum Caesaris ac Seiani censuere crebrisque precibus efflagitabant visendi sui copiam facerent$$ And so ,  although their advice was asked on totally different subjects ,  they decreed an altar to Clemency ,  an altar to Friendship ,  and statues round them to Caesar and Sejanus ,  both of whom they earnestly begged with repeated entreaties to allow themselves to be seen in public
 non illi tamen in urbem aut propinqua urbi degressi sunt$$ Still ,  neither of them would visit Rome or even the neighbourhood of Rome

 ibi campo aut litore iacentes nullo discrimine noctem ac diem iuxta gratiam aut fastus ianitorum perpetiebantur donec id quoque vetitum et revenere in urbem trepidi quos non sermone , non visu dignatus erat , quidam male alacres quibus infaustae amicitiae gravis exitus imminebat$$ but there ,  as they lounged in promiscuous crowds in the fields or on the shore ,  they had to bear day and night alike the patronising smiles and the supercilious insolence of hall-porters ,  till even this was forbidden them ,  and those whom Sejanus had not deigned to accost or to look on ,  returned to the capital in alarm ,  while some felt an evil joy ,  though there hung over them the dreadful doom of that ill-starred friendship

 sic ipsam maluisse quin et parte eiusdem epistulae increpuit amicitias muliebris , Fufium consulem oblique perstringens$$ In a part of the same letter he sneered at female friendships ,  with an indirect censure on the consul Fufius ,  who had risen to distinction through Augusta's partiality
 is gratia Augustae floruerat , aptus adliciendis feminarum animis , dicax idem et Tiberium acerbis facetiis inridere solitus quarum apud praepotentis in longum memoria est$$ Fufius was indeed a man well fitted to win the affection of a woman he was witty too ,  and accustomed to ridicule Tiberius with those bitter jests which the powerful remember so long
 Fuit in senatu Iunius Rusticus , componendis patrum actis delectus a Caesare eoque meditationes eius introspicere creditus$$ There was in the Senate one Junius Rusticus ,  who having been appointed by the emperor to register its debates was therefore supposed to have an insight into his secret purposes

 ita nihil triste illo die patratum$$ And so that day passed without any dreadful result
 ferebantur etiam sub nominibus consularium fictae in Seianum sententiae , exercentibus plerisque per occultum atque eo procacius libidinem ingeniorum$$ Fictitious speeches too against Sejanus were published under the names of ex-consuls ,  for several persons indulged ,  all the more recklessly because anonymously ,  the caprice of their imaginations

 miserius sit ob amicitiam accusari an amicum accusare haud discreverim$$ Which is the most pitiable ,  to be accused for friendship's sake or to have to accuse a friend ,  I cannot decide

 Placitum posthac ut in reliquos Seiani liberos adverteretur , vanescente quamquam plebis ira ac plerisque per priora supplicia lenitis$$ It was next decided to punish the remaining children of Sejanus ,  though the fury of the populace was subsiding ,  and people generally had been appeased by the previous executions
 igitur portantur in carcerem , filius imminentium intellegens , puella adeo nescia ut crebro interrogaret quod ob delictum et quo traheretur neque facturam ultra et posse se puerili verbere moneri$$ Accordingly they were carried off to prison ,  the boy ,  aware of his impending doom ,  and the little girl ,  who was so unconscious that she continually asked what was her offence ,  and whither she was being dragged ,  saying that she would do so no more ,  and a childish chastisement was enough for her correction
 tradunt temporis eius auctores , quia triumvirali supplicio adfici virginem inauditum habebatur , a carnifice laqueum iuxta compressam$$ Historians of the time tell us that ,  as there was no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin ,  she was violated by the executioner ,  with the rope on her neck

 per dolumque comitantibus adliciebantur ignari fama nominis et promptis Graecorum animis ad nova et mira$$ The renown of the name attracted the ignorant ,  and the Greek mind eagerly fastens on what is new and marvellous
 quippe elapsum custodiae pergere ad paternos exercitus , Aegyptum aut Syriam invasurum , fingebant simul credebantque$$ The story indeed ,  which they no sooner invented than believed ,  was that Drusus had escaped from custody ,  and was on his way to the armies of his father ,  with the design of invading Egypt or Syria
 iam iuventutis concursu , iam publicis studiis frequentabatur , laetus praesentibus et inanium spe , cum auditum id Poppaeo Sabino$$ And he was now drawing to himself a multitude of young men and much popular enthusiasm ,  enjoying the present and cherishing idle hopes of the future ,  when Poppaeus Sabinus heard of the affair
 is Macedoniae tum intentus Achaiam quoque curabat$$ At the time he was chiefly occupied with Macedonia ,  but he also had the charge of Achaia
 igitur quo vera seu falsa antiret Toronaeum Thermaeumque sinum praefestinans , mox Euboeam Aegaei maris insulam et Piraeum Atticae orae , dein Corinthiense litus angustiasque Isthmi evadit marique alio Nicopolim Romanam coloniam ingressus , ibi demum cognoscit sollertius interrogatum quisnam foret dixisse Marcus Silano genitum et multis sectatorum dilapsis ascendisse navem tamquam Italiam peteret$$ So ,  to forestall the danger ,  let the story be true or false ,  he hurried by the bays of Torone and Thermae ,  then passed on to Euboea ,  an island of the Aegaean ,  to Piraeus ,  on the coast of Attica ,  thence to the shores of Corinth and the narrow Isthmus ,  and having arrived by the other sea at Nicopolis ,  a Roman colony ,  he there at last ascertained that the man ,  when skilfully questioned ,  had said that he was the son of Marcus Silanus ,  and that ,  after the dispersion of a number of his followers' he had embarked on a vessel ,  intending ,  it seemed ,  to go to Italy
 scripsitque haec Tiberio neque nos originem finemve eius rei ultra comperimus$$ Sabinus sent this account to Tiberius ,  and of the origin and issue of the affair nothing more is known to me
 Exim Cotta Messalinus , saevissimae cuiusque sen tentiae auctor eoque inveterata invidia , ubi primum facultas data arguitur pleraque Gaius Caesarem quasi incestae virilitatis , et cum die natali Augustae inter sacerdotes epularetur , novendialem eam cenam dixisse$$ Several charges were next brought ,  as soon as the opportunity offered ,  against Cotta Messalinus ,  the author of every unusually cruel proposal ,  and consequently ,  regarded with inveterate hatred He had spoken ,  it was said ,  of Caius Caesar ,  as if it were a question whether he was a man ,  and of an entertainment at which he was present on Augusta's birthday with the priests ,  as a funeral banquet
 querensque de potentia M Lepidi ac Lucius Arruntii , cum quibus ob rem pecuniariam disceptabat , addidisse$$ In remonstrating too against the influence of Marcus Lepidus and Lucius Arruntius ,  with whom he had disputes on many matters ,  he had added the remark ,  They will have the Senate's support
 illos quidem senatus , me autem tuebitur Tiberiolus meus$$ I shall have that of my darling Tiberius
 quae cuncta a primoribus civitatis revincebatur iisque instantibus ad imperatorem provocavit$$ But the leading men of the State failed to convict him on all the charges When they pressed the case ,  he appealed to the emperor
 nec multo post litterae adferuntur quibus in modum defensionis , repetito inter se atque Cottam amicitiae principio crebrisque eius officiis commemoratis , ne verba prave detorta neu convivalium fabularum simplicitas in crimen duceretur postulavit$$ Soon afterwards ,  a letter arrived ,  in which Tiberius traced the origin of the friendship between himself and Cotta ,  enumerated his frequent services ,  and then requested that words perversely misrepresented and the freedom of table talk might not be construed into a crime
 Insigne visum est earum Caesaris litterarum initium$$ The beginning of the emperor's letter seemed very striking
 nam his verbis exorsus est$$ It opened thus 
 quid scribam vobis , patres conscripti , aut quo modo scribam aut quid omnino non scribam hoc tempore , di me deaeque peius perdant quam perire me cotidie sentio , si scio$$  May all the gods and goddesses destroy me more miserably than I feel myself to be daily perishing ,  if I know at know at this moment what to write to you ,  Senators ,  how to write it ,  or what ,  in short ,  not to write
 adeo facinora atque flagitia sua ipsi quoque in supplicium verterant$$ So completely had his crimes and infamies recoiled ,  as a penalty ,  on himself
 neque frustra praestantissimus sapientiae firmare solitus est , si recludantur tyrannorum mentes , posse aspici laniatus et ictus , quando ut corpora verberibus , ita saevitia , libidine , malis consultis animus dilaceretur$$ With profound meaning was it often affirmed by the greatest teacher of philosophy that ,  could the minds of tyrants be laid bare ,  there would be seen gashes and wounds for ,  as the body is lacerated by scourging ,  so is the spirit by brutality ,  by lust and by evil thoughts
 quippe Tiberium non fortuna , non solitudines protegebant quin tormenta pectoris suasque ipse poenas fateretur$$ Assuredly Tiberius was not saved by his elevation or his solitude from having to confess the anguish of his heart and his self-inflicted punishment
 Tum facta patribus potestate statuendi de Caeciliano senatore qui plurima adversum Cottam prompserat , placitum eandem poenam inrogari quam in Aruseium et Sanquinium , accusatores Lucius Arruntii$$ Authority was then given to the Senate to decide the case of Caecilianus ,  one of its members ,  the chief witness against Cotta ,  and it was agreed that the same penalty should be inflicted as on Aruseius and Sanquinius ,  the accusers of Lucius Arruntius
 quo non aliud honorificentius Cottae evenit , qui nobilis quidem set egens ob luxum , per flagitia infamis , sanctissimis Arruntii artibus dignitate ultionis aequabatur$$ Nothing ever happened to Cotta more to his distinction Of noble birth ,  but beggared by extravagance and infamous for his excesses ,  he was now by dignity of his revenge ,  raised to a level with the stainless virtues of Arruntius
 Quintus Servaeus posthac et Minucius Thermus inducti , Servaeus praetura functus et quondam Germanici comes , Minucius equestri loco , modeste habita Seiani amicitia$$ Quintus Servaeus and Minucius Thermus were next arraigned Servaeus was an ex-praetor ,  and had formerly been a companion of Germanicus
 unde illis maior miseratio$$ Minucius was of equestrian rank ,  and both had enjoyed ,  though discreetly ,  the friendship of Sejanus
 contra Tiberius praecipuos ad scelera increpans admonuit Gaius Cestium patrem dicere senatui quae sibi scripisset , suscepitque Cestius accusationem$$ Hence they were the more pitied Tiberius ,  on the contrary ,  denounced them as foremost in crime ,  and bade Caius Cestius ,  the elder ,  tell the Senate what he had communicated to the emperor by letter
 quod maxime exitiabile tulere illa tempora , cum primores senatus infimas etiam delationes exercerent , alii propalam , multi per occultum$$ Cestius undertook the prosecution And this was the most dreadful feature of the age ,  that leading members of the Senate ,  some openly ,  some secretly employed themselves in the very lowest work of the informer
 neque discerneres alienos a coniunctis , amicos ab ignotis , quid repens aut vetustate obscurum$$ One could not distinguish between aliens and kinsfolk ,  between friends and strangers ,  or say what was quite recent ,  or what half-forgotten from lapse of time
 perinde in foro , in convivio , quaqua de re locuti incusabantur , ut quis praevenire et reum destinare properat , pars ad subsidium sui , plures infecti quasi valetudine et contactu$$ People were incriminated for some casual remark in the forum or at the dinner-table ,  for every one was impatient to be the first to mark his victim ,  some to screen themselves ,  most from being ,  as it were ,  infected with the contagion of the malady
 sed Minu cius et Servaeus damnati indicibus accessere$$ Minucius and Servaeus ,  on being condemned ,  went over to the prosecution ,  and then Julius Africanus with Seius Quadratus were dragged into the same ruin
 tractique sunt in casum eundem Iulius Africanus e Santonis Gallica civitate , Seius Quadratus$$ Africanus was from the Santones ,  one of the states of Gaul
 originem non repperi$$ the origin of Quadratus I have not ascertained
 neque sum ignarus a plerisque scriptoribus omissa multorum pericula et poenas , dum copia fatiscunt aut quae ipsis nimia et maesta fuerant ne pari taedio lecturos adficerent verentur$$ Many authors ,  I am well aware ,  have passed over the perils and punishments of a host of persons ,  sickened by the multiplicity of them ,  or fearing that what they had themselves found wearisome and saddening would be equally fatiguing to their readers
 nobis pleraque digna cognitu obvenere , quamquam ab aliis incelebrata$$ For myself ,  I have lighted on many facts worth knowing ,  though other writers have not recorded them
 Nam ea tempestate qua Seiani amicitiam ceteri falso exuerant ausus est eques Romanus Marcus Terentius , ob id reus , amplecti , ad hunc modum apud senatum ordiendo$$ A Roman knight ,  Marcus Terentius ,  at the crisis when all others had hypocritically repudiated the friendship of Sejanus ,  dared ,  when impeached on that ground ,  to cling to it by the following avowal to the Senate 
 fortunae quidem meae fortasse minus expediat adgnoscere crimen quam abnuere$$  In my position it is perhaps less to my advantage to acknowledge than to deny the charge
 sed utcumque casura res est , fatebor et fuisse me Seiano amicum et ut essem expetisse et postquam adeptus eram laetatum$$ Still ,  whatever is to be the issue of the matter ,  I shall admit that I was the friend of Sejanus ,  that I anxiously sought to be such ,  and was delighted when I was successful
 videram collegam patris regendis praetoriis cohortibus , mox urbis et militiae munis simul obeuntem$$ I had seen him his father's colleague in the command of the praetorian cohorts ,  and subsequently combining the duties of civil and military life
 illius propinqui et adfines honoribus augebantur$$ His kinsfolk and connections were loaded with honours
 ut quisque Seiano intimus ita ad Caesaris amicitiam validus$$ intimacy with Sejanus was in every case a powerful recommendation to the emperor's friendship
 contra quibus infensus esset , metu ac sordibus conflictabantur$$ Those ,  on the contrary ,  whom he hated ,  had to struggle with danger and humiliation
 nec quemquam exemplo adsumo$$ I take no individual as an instance
 cunctos qui novissimi consilii expertes fuimus meo unius discrimine defendam$$ All of us who had no part in his last design ,  I mean to defend at the peril of myself alone
 non enim Seianum Vulsiniensem set Claudiae et Iuliae domus partem , quas adfinitate occu paverat , tuum , Caesar , generum , tui consulatus socium , tua officia in re publica capessentem colebamus$$ It was really not Sejanus of Vulsinii ,  it was a member of the Claudian and Julian houses ,  in which he had taken a position by his marriage-alliance ,  it was your son-in-law ,  Caesar ,  your partner in the consulship ,  the man who administered your political functions ,  whom we courted
 non est nostrum aestimare quem supra ceteros et quibus de causis extollas$$ It is not for us to criticise one whom you may raise above all others ,  or your motives for so doing
 tibi summum rerum iudicium di dedere , nobis obsequii gloria relicta est$$ Heaven has intrusted you with the supreme decision of affairs ,  and for us is left the glory of obedience
 spectamus porro quae coram habentur , cui ex te opes honores , quis plurima iuvandi nocendive potentia , quae Seiano fuisse nemo negaverit$$ And ,  again ,  we see what takes place before our eyes ,  who it is on whom you bestow riches and honours ,  who are the most powerful to help or to injure
 abditos principis sensus et si quid occultius parat exquirere inlicitum , anceps$$ That Sejanus was such ,  no one will deny
 nec ideo adsequare ne , patres conscripti , ultimum Seiani diem sed sedecim annos cogi taveritis$$ To explore the prince's secret thoughts ,  or any of his hidden plans ,  is a forbidden ,  a dangerous thing ,  nor does it follow that one could reach them
 etiam Satrium atque Pomponium venerabamur$$ Do not ,  Senators ,  think only of Sejanus's last day ,  but of his sixteen years of power
 libertis quoque ac ianitoribus eius notescere pro magnifico accipiebatur$$ We actually adored a Satrius and a Pomponius
 quid ergo$$ To be known even to his freedmen and hall-porters was thought something very grand
 indistincta haec defensio et promisca dabitur$$ What then is my meaning
 immo iustis terminis dividatur$$ Is this apology meant to be offered for all without difference and discrimination
 insidiae in rem publicam , consilia caedis adversum imperatorem puniantur$$ No
 de amicitia et officiis idem finis et te , Caesar , et nos absolverit$$ it is to be restricted within proper limits
 Constantia orationis et quia repertus erat qui efferret quae omnes animo agitabant eo usque potuere ut accusatores eius , additis quae ante deliquerant , exilio aut morte multarentur$$ The courage of this speech and the fact that there had been found a man to speak out what was in all people's thoughts ,  had such an effect that the accusers of Terentius were sentenced to banishment or death ,  their previous offences being taken into account
 Secutae dehinc Tiberii litterae in Sex Vistilium praetorium , quem Druso fratri percarum in cohortem suam transtulerat$$ Then came a letter from Tiberius against Sextus Vestilius ,  an ex-praetor ,  whom ,  as a special favourite of his brother Drusus ,  the emperor had admitted into his own select circle
 causa offensionis Vistilio fuit , seu composuerat quaedam in Gaium Caesarem ut impudicum , sive ficto habita fides$$ His reason for being displeased with Vestilius was that he had either written an attack on Caius Caesar as a profligate ,  or that Tiberius believed a false charge
 atque ob id convictu principis prohibitus cum senili manu ferrum temptavisset , obligat venas$$ For this Vestilius was excluded from the prince's table
 precatus que per codicillos , immiti rescripto venas resolvit acervatim ex eo Annius Pollio , Appius Silanus Scauro Mamerco simul ac Sabino Calvisio maiestatis postulantur , et Vinicianus Pollioni patri adiciebatur , clari genus et quidam summis honoribus contremuerantque patres (nam quotus quisque adfinitatis aut amicitiae tot inlustrium virorum expers erat$$ He then tried the knife with his aged hand ,  but again bound up his veins ,  opening them once more however on having begged for pardon by letter and received a pitiless answer After him a host of persons were charged with treason ,  Annius Pollio ,  Appius Silanus ,  Scaurus Mamercus ,  Sabinus Calvisius ,  Vinicianus too ,  coupled with Pollio ,  his father ,  men all of illustrious descent ,  some too of the highest political distinction
) , ni Celsus urbanae cohortis tribunus , tum inter indices , Appium et Calvisium discrimini exemisset Caesar Pollionis ac Viniciani Scaurique causam ut ipse cum senatu nosceret distulit , datis quibusdam in Scaurum tristibus notis$$ The senators were panic-stricken ,  for how few of their number were not connected by alliance or by friendship with this multitude of men of rank!

 Marino participe Seianus Curtium Atticum oppresserat$$ Vescularius was his agent in the plot against Libo ,  and it was with the co-operation of Marinus that Sejanus had ruined Curtius Atticus
 quo laetius acceptum sua exempla in consultores recidisse$$ Hence there was all the more joy at the recoil of these precedents on their authors
 Per idem tempus Lucius Piso pontifex , rarum in tanta claritudine , fato obiit , nullius servilis sententiae sponte auctor et quoties necessitas ingrueret sapienter moderans$$ About the same time Lucius Piso ,  the pontiff ,  died a natural death ,  a rare incident in so high a rank Never had he by choice proposed a servile motion ,  and ,  whenever necessity was too strong for him ,  he would suggest judicious compromises
 patrem ei censorium fuisse memoravi$$ His father ,  as I have related ,  had been a censor
 aetas ad octogesimum annum processit$$ He lived to the advanced age of eighty ,  and had won in Thrace the honour of a triumph
 decus triumphale in Thraecia meruerat sed praecipua ex eo gloria quod praefectus urbi recens continuam potestatem et insolentia parendi graviorem mire temperavit$$ But his chief glory rested on the wonderful tact with which as city-prefect he handled an authority ,  recently made perpetual and all the more galling to men unaccustomed to obey it
 Isdem consulibus gravitate annonae iuxta seditionem ventum multaque et pluris per dies in theatro licentius efflagitata quam solitum adversum imperatorem$$ During the same consulship a high price of corn almost brought on an insurrection For several days there were many clamorous demands made in the theatre with an unusual freedom of language towards the emperor
 quis commotus incusavit magistratus patresque quod non publica auctoritate populum coercuissent addiditque quibus ex provinciis et quanto maiorem quam Augustus rei frumentariae copiam advectaret$$ This provoked him to censure the magistrates and the Senate for not having used the authority of the State to put down the people He named too the corn-supplying provinces ,  and dwelt on the far larger amount of grain imported by himself than by Augustus
 ita castigandae plebi compositum senatus consultum prisca severitate neque segnius consules edixere$$ So the Senate drew up a decree in the severe spirit of antiquity ,  and the consuls issued a not less stringent proclamation
 silentium ipsius non civile , ut crediderat , sed in superbiam accipiebatur$$ The emperor's silence was not ,  as he had hoped ,  taken as a proof of patriotism ,  but of pride
 Ser Galba Lucius Sulla consulibus diu quaesito quos neptibus suis maritos destinaret Caesar , postquam instabat virginum aetas , Lucius Cassium , Marcus Vinicium legit$$ In the consulship of Servius Galba and Lucius Sulla ,  the emperor ,  after having long considered whom he was to choose to be husbands for his granddaughters ,  now that the maidens were of marriageable age ,  selected Lucius Cassius and Marcus Vinicius

 Cassius plebeii Romae generis , verum antiqui honoratique , et severa patris disciplina eductus facilitate saepius quam industria commendabatur$$ He was a man of amiable temper and of cultivated eloquence Cassius was of an ancient and honourable ,  though plebeian house ,  at Rome Though he was brought up by his father under a severe training ,  he won esteem more frequently by his good-nature than by his diligence
 huic Drusillam , Vinicio Iuliam Germanico genitas coniungit superque ea re senatui scribit levi cum honore iuvenum$$ To him and to Vinicius the emperor married respectively Drusilla and Julia ,  Germanicus's daughters ,  and addressed a letter on the subject to the Senate ,  with a slightly complimentary mention of the young men
 dein redditis absentiae causis admodum vagis flexit ad graviora et offensiones ob rem publicam coeptas , utque Macro praefectus tribunorumque et centurionum pauci secum introirent quoties curiam ingrederetur petivit$$ He next assigned some very vague reasons for his absence ,  then passed to more important matters ,  the ill-will against him originating in his state policy ,  and requested that Macro ,  who commanded the praetorians ,  with a few tribunes and centurions ,  might accompany him whenever he entered the Senate-house
 factoque large et sine praescriptione generis aut numeri senatus consulto ne tecta quidem urbis , adeo publicum consilium numquam adiit , deviis plerumque itineribus ambiens patriam et declinans$$ But though a decree was voted by the Senate on a liberal scale and without any restrictions as to rank or numbers ,  he never so much as went near the walls of Rome ,  much less the State-council ,  for he would often go round and avoid his native city by circuitous routes
 Interea magna vis accusatorum in eos inrupit qui pecunias faenore auctitabant adversum legem dictatoris Caesaris qua de modo credendi possidendique intra Italiam caventur , omissam olim , quia privato usui bonum publicum postponitur$$ Meanwhile a powerful host of accusers fell with sudden fury on the class which systematically increased its wealth by usury in defiance of a law passed by Caesar the Dictator defining the terms of lending money and of holding estates in Italy ,  a law long obsolete because the public good is sacrificed to private interest
 sane vetus urbi faenebre malum et seditionum discordiarumque creberrima causa eoque cohibebatur antiquis quoque et minus corruptis moribus$$ The curse of usury was indeed of old standing in Rome and a most frequent cause of sedition and discord ,  and it was therefore repressed even in the early days of a less corrupt morality
 nam primo duodecim tabulis sanctum ne quis unciario faenore amplius exerceret , cum antea ex libidine locupletium agitaretur$$ First ,  the Twelve Tables prohibited any one from exacting more than 10 per cent ,  when ,  previously ,  the rate had depended on the caprice of the wealthy
 dein rogatione tribunicia ad semuncias redactum , postremo vetita versura$$ Subsequently ,  by a bill brought in by the tribunes ,  interest was reduced to half that amount ,  and finally compound interest was wholly forbidden
 multisque plebi scitis obviam itum fraudibus quae toties repressae miras per artes rursum oriebantur$$ A check too was put by several enactments of the people on evasions which ,  though continually put down ,  still ,  through strange artifices ,  reappeared
 sed tum Gracchus praetor , cui ea quaestio evenerat , multitudine periclitantium subactus rettulit ad senatum , trepidique patres (neque enim quisquam tali culpa vacuus) veniam a principe petivere$$ On this occasion ,  however ,  Gracchus ,  the praetor ,  to whose jurisdiction the inquiry had fallen ,  felt himself compelled by the number of persons endangered to refer the matter to the Senate In their dismay the senators ,  not one of whom was free from similar guilt ,  threw themselves on the emperor's indulgence
 et concedente annus in posterum sexque menses dati quis secundum iussa legis rationes familiaris quisque componerent$$ He yielded ,  and a year and six months were granted ,  within which every one was to settle his private accounts conformably to the requirements of the law
 Hinc inopia rei nummariae , commoto simul omnium aere alieno , et quia tot damnatis bonisque eorum divenditis signatum argentum fisco vel aerario attinebatur$$ Hence followed a scarcity of money ,  a great shock being given to all credit ,  the current coin too ,  in consequence of the conviction of so many persons and the sale of their property ,  being locked up in the imperial treasury or the public exchequer
 ad hoc senatus praescripserat , duas quisque faenoris partis in agris per Italiam conlocaret$$ To meet this ,  the Senate had directed that every creditor should have two-thirds his capital secured on estates in Italy
 sed creditores in solidum appellabant nec decorum appellatis minuere fidem$$ Creditors however were suing for payment in full ,  and it was not respectable for persons when sued to break faith
 ita primo concursatio et preces , dein strepere praetoris tribunal , eaque quae remedio quaesita , venditio et emptio , in contrarium mutari quia faeneratores omnem pecuniam mercandis agris condiderant$$ So ,  at first ,  there were clamorous meetings and importunate entreaties then noisy applications to the praetor's court And the very device intended as a remedy ,  the sale and purchase of estates ,  proved the contrary ,  as the usurers had hoarded up all their money for buying land
 copiam vendendi secuta vilitate , quanto quis obaeratior , aegrius distrahebant , multique fortunis provolvebantur$$ The facilities for selling were followed by a fall of prices ,  and the deeper a man was in debt ,  the more reluctantly did he part with his property ,  and many were utterly ruined
 eversio rei familiaris dignitatem ac famam praeceps dabat , donec tulit opem Caesar disposito per mensas milies sestertio factaque mutuandi copia sine usuris per triennium , si debitor populo in duplum praediis cavisset$$ The destruction of private wealth precipitated the fall of rank and reputation ,  till at last the emperor interposed his aid by distributing throughout the banks a hundred million sesterces ,  and allowing freedom to borrow without interest for three years ,  provided the borrower gave security to the State in land to double the amount
 sic refecta fides et paulatim privati quoque creditores reperti$$ Credit was thus restored ,  and gradually private lenders were found
 neque emptio agrorum exercita ad formam senatus consulti , acribus , ut ferme talia , initiis , incurioso fine$$ The purchase too of estates was not carried out according to the letter of the Senate's decree ,  rigour at the outset ,  as usual with such matters ,  becoming negligence in the end
 Dein redeunt priores metus postulato maiestatis Considio Proculo$$ Former alarms then returned ,  as there was a charge of treason against Considius Proculus
 qui nullo pavore diem natalem celebrans raptus in curiam pariterque damnatus interfectusque , et sorori eius Sanciae aqua atque igni interdictum accusante Quintus Pomponio is moribus inquies haec et huiusce modi a se factitari praetendebat ut parta apud principem gratia periculis Pomponii Secundi fratris mederetur$$ While he was celebrating his birthday without a fear ,  he was hurried before the Senate ,  condemned and instantly put to death His sister Sancia was outlawed ,  on the accusation of Quintus Pomponius ,  a restless spirit ,  who pretended that he employed himself in this and like practices to win favour with the sovereign ,  and thereby alleviate the perils hanging over his brother Pomponius Secundus
 etiam in Pompeiam Macrinam exilium statuitur cuius maritum Argolicum socerum Laconem e primoribus Achaeorum Caesar adflixerat$$ Pompeia Macrina too was sentenced to banishment Her husband Argolicus and her father-in-law Laco ,  leading men of Achaia ,  had been ruined by the emperor
 pater quoque inlustris eques Romanus ac frater praetorius , cum damnatio instaret , se ipsi interfecere$$ Her father likewise ,  an illustrious Roman knight ,  and her brother ,  an ex-praetor ,  seeing their doom was near ,  destroyed themselves
 datum erat crimini quod Theophanen Mytilenaeum proavum eorum Gnaeus Magnus inter intimos habuisset , quodque defuncto Theophani caelestis honores Graeca adulatio tribuerat$$ It was imputed to them as a crime that their great-grandfather Theophanes of Mitylene had been one of the intimate friends of Pompey the Great ,  and that after his death Greek flattery had paid him divine honours
 Sub idem tempus G Caesar , discedenti Capreas avo comes , Claudiam , Marcus Silani filiam , coniugio accepit , immanem animum subdola modestia tegens , non damnatione matris , non exitio fratrum rupta voce$$ About this time Caius Caesar ,  who became his grandfather's companion on his retirement to Capreae ,  married Claudia ,  daughter of Marcus Silanus He was a man who masked a savage temper under an artful guise of self-restraint ,  and neither his mother's doom nor the banishment of his brothers extorted from him a single utterance
 qualem diem Tiberius induisset , pari habitu , haud multum distantibus verbis$$ Whatever the humour of the day with Tiberius ,  he would assume the like ,  and his language differed as little
 unde mox scitum Passieni oratoris dictum percrebuit neque meliorem umquam servum neque deteriorem dominum fuisse$$ Hence the fame of a clever remark from the orator Passienus ,  that there never was a better slave or a worse master
 Non omiserim praesagium Tiberii de Servio Galba tum consule$$ I must not pass over a prognostication of Tiberius respecting Servius Galba ,  then consul
 quem accitum et diversis sermonibus pertemptatum postremo Graecis verbis in hanc sententiam adlocutus et tu , Galba , quandoque degustabis imperium , seram ac brevem potentiam significans , scientia Chaldaeorum artis , cuius apiscendae otium apud Rhodum , magistrum Thrasullum habuit , peritiam eius hoc modo expertus$$ Having sent for him and sounded him on various topics ,  he at last addressed him in Greek to this effect   You too ,  Galba ,  will some day have a taste of empire He thus hinted at a brief span of power late in life ,  on the strength of his acquaintance with the art of astrologers ,  leisure for acquiring which he had had at Rhodes ,  with Thrasyllus for instructor This man's skill he tested in the following manner
 Quotiens super tali negotio consultaret , edita domus parte ac liberti unius conscientia utebatur$$ Whenever he sought counsel on such matters ,  he would make use of the top of the house and of the confidence of one freedman ,  quite illiterate and of great physical strength
 is litterarum ignarus , corpore valido , per avia ac derupta (nam saxis domus imminet) praeibat eum cuius artem experiri Tiberius statuisset et regredientem , si vanitatis aut fraudum suspicio incesserat , in subiectum mare praecipitabat ne index arcani existeret$$ The man always walked in front of the person whose science Tiberius had determined to test ,  through an unfrequented and precipitous path (for the house stood on rocks) ,  and then ,  if any suspicion had arisen of imposture or of trickery ,  he hurled the astrologer ,  as he returned ,  into the sea beneath ,  that no one might live to betray the secret
 igitur Thrasullus isdem rupibus inductus postquam percontantem commoverat , imperium ipsi et futura sollerter patefaciens , interrogatur an suam quoque genitalem horam comperisset , quem tum annum , qualem diem haberet$$ Thrasyllus accordingly was led up the same cliffs ,  and when he had deeply impressed his questioner by cleverly revealing his imperial destiny and future career ,  he was asked whether he had also thoroughly ascertained his own horoscope ,  and the character of that particular year and day
 ille positus siderum ac spatia dimensus haerere primo , dein pavescere , et quantum introspiceret magis ac magis trepidus admirationis et metus , postremo exclamat ambiguum sibi ac prope ultimum discrimen instare$$ After surveying the positions and relative distances of the stars ,  he first paused ,  then trembled ,  and the longer he gazed ,  the more was he agitated by amazement and terror ,  till at last he exclaimed that a perilous and well-nigh fatal crisis impended over him
 tum complexus eum Tiberius praescium periculorum et incolumem fore gratatur , quaeque dixerat oracli vice accipiens inter intimos amicorum tenet$$ Tiberius then embraced him and congratulated him on foreseeing his dangers and on being quite safe Taking what he had said as an oracle ,  he retained him in the number of his intimate friends
 Isdem consulibus Asinii Galli mors vulgatur , quem egestate cibi peremptum haud dubium , sponte vel necessitate incertum habebatur$$ That same year the death of Asinius Gallus became known That he died of starvation ,  there was not a doubt whether of his own choice or by compulsion ,  was a question
 consultusque Caesar an sepeliri sineret , non erubuit permittere ultroque incusare casus qui reum abstulissent antequam coram convinceretur$$ The emperor was asked whether he would allow him to be buried ,  and he blushed not to grant the favour ,  and actually blamed the accident which had proved fatal to the accused before he could be convicted in his presence
 scilicet medio triennio defuerat tempus subeundi iudicium consulari seni , tot consularium parenti$$ Just as if in a three years' interval an opportunity was wanting for the trial of an old ex-consul and the father of a number of ex-consuls
 Drusus deinde extinguitur , cum se miserandis alimentis , mandendo e cubili tomento , nonum ad diem detinuisset$$ Next Drusus perished ,  after having prolonged life for eight days on the most wretched of food ,  even chewing the stuffing ,  his bed
 tradidere quidam praescriptum fuisse Macroni , si arma ab Seiano temptarentur , extractum custodiae iuvenem (nam in Palatio attinebatur) ducem populo imponere$$ According to some writers ,  Macro had been instructed that ,  in case of Sejanus attempting an armed revolt ,  he was to hurry the young prince out of the confinement in which he was detained in the Palace and put him at the head of the people
 mox , quia rumor incedebat fore ut nuru ac nepoti conciliaretur Caesar , saevitiam quam paenitentiam maluit$$ Subsequently the emperor ,  as a rumour was gaining ground that he was on the point of a reconciliation with his daughter-in-law and his grandson ,  chose to be merciless rather than to relent
 Quin et invectus in defunctum probra corporis , exitiabilem in suos , infensum rei publicae animum obiecit recitarique factorum dictorumque eius descripta per dies iussit , quo non aliud atrocius visum$$ He even bitterly reviled him after his death ,  taunting him with nameless abominations and with a spirit bent on his family's ruin and hostile to the State And ,  what seemed most horrible of all ,  he ordered a daily journal of all that he said and did to be read in public
 adstitisse tot per annos , qui vultum , gemitus , occultum etiam murmur exciperent , et potuisse avum audire , legeret , in publicum promere vix fides , nisi quod Attii centurionis et Didymi liberti epistulae servorum nomina praeferebant , ut quis egredientem cubiculo Drusum pulsaverat , exterruerat$$ That there had been spies by his side for so many years ,  to note his looks ,  his sighs ,  and even his whispered thoughts ,  and that his grandfather could have heard read ,  and published all ,  was scarce credible But letters of Attius ,  a centurion ,  and Didymus ,  a freedman ,  openly exhibited the names of slave after slave who had respectively struck or scared Drusus as he was quitting his chamber
 etiam sua verba centurio saevitiae plena , tamquam egregium , vocesque deficientis adiecerat , quis primo alienationem mentis simulans quasi per dementiam funesta Tiberio , mox , ubi exspes vitae fuit , meditatas compositasque diras imprecabatur , ut , quem ad modum nurum filiumque fratris et nepotes domumque omnem caedibus complevisset , ita poenas nomini generique maiorum et posteris exolveret$$ The centurion had actually added ,  as something highly meritorious ,  his own language in all its brutality ,  and some utterances of the dying man in which ,  at first feigning loss of reason ,  he imprecated in seeming madness fearful things on Tiberius ,  and then ,  when hope of life was gone ,  denounced him with a studied and elaborate curse As he had slain a daughter-in-law ,  a brother's son ,  and son's sons ,  and filled his whole house with bloodshed ,  so might he pay the full penalty due to the name and race of his ancestors as well as to future generations
 obturbabant quidem patres specie detestandi sed penetrabat pavor et admiratio , callidum olim et tegendis sceleribus obscurum huc confidentiae venisse ut tamquam dimotis parietibus ostenderet nepotem sub verbere centurionis , inter servorum ictus extrema vitae alimenta frustra orantem$$ The Senate clamorously interrupted ,  with an affectation of horror ,  but they were penetrated by alarm and amazement at seeing that a hitherto cunning prince ,  who had shrouded his wickedness in mystery ,  had waxed so bold as to remove ,  so to speak ,  the walls of his house and display his grandson under a centurion's lash ,  amid the buffetings of slaves ,  craving in vain the last sustenance of life
 Nondum is dolor exoleverat , cum de Agrippina auditum , quam interfecto Seiano spe sustentatam provixisse reor , et postquam nihil de saevitia remittebatur , voluntate extinctam , nisi si negatis alimentis adsimulatus est finis qui videretur sponte sumptus$$ Men's grief at all this had not died away when news was heard of Agrippina She had lived on ,  sustained by hope ,  I suppose ,  after the destruction of Sejanus ,  and ,  when she found no abatement of horrors ,  had voluntarily perished ,  though possibly nourishment was refused her and a fiction concocted of a death that might seem self-chosen
 enimvero Tiberius foedissimis criminationibus exarsit , impudicitiam arguens et Asinium Gallum adulterum , eiusque morte ad taedium vitae compulsam$$ Tiberius ,  it is certain ,  vented his wrath in the foulest charges He reproached her with unchastity ,  with having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence
 sed Agrippina aequi impatiens , dominandi avida , virilibus curis feminarum vitia exuerat$$ But Agrippina ,  who could not endure equality and loved to domineer ,  was with her masculine aspirations far removed from the frailties of women
 eodem die defunctam , quo biennio ante Seianus poenas luisset , memoriaeque id prodendum addidit Caesar iactavitque quod non laqueo strangulata neque in Gemonias proiecta foret$$ The emperor further observed that she died on the same day on which Sejanus had paid the penalty of his crime two years before ,  a fact ,  he said ,  to be recorded and he made it a boast that she had not been strangled by the halter and flung down the Gemonian steps
 actae ob id grates decretumque ut quintum decimum kal Novembris , utriusque necis die , per omnis annos donum Iovi sacraretur$$ He received a vote of thanks ,  and it was decreed that on the seventeenth of October ,  the day on which both perished ,  through all future years ,  an offering should be consecrated to Jupiter
 At Romae caede continua Pomponius Labeo , quem praefuisse Moesiae rettuli , per abruptas venas sanguinem effudit$$ Rome meanwhile being a scene of ceaseless bloodshed ,  Pomponius Labeo ,  who was ,  as I have related ,  governor of Moesia ,  severed his veins and let his life ebb from him
 aemulataque est coniunx Paxaea$$ His wife ,  Paxaea ,  emulated her husband
 nam promptas eius modi mortes metus carnificis faciebat , et quia damnati publicatis bonis sepultura prohibebantur , eorum qui de se statuebant humabantur corpora , manebant testamenta , pretium festinandi$$ What made such deaths eagerly sought was dread of the executioner ,  and the fact too that the condemned ,  besides forfeiture of their property ,  were deprived of burial ,  while those who decided their fate themselves ,  had their bodies interred ,  and their wills remained valid ,  a recompense this for their despatch
 sed Caesar missis ad senatum litteris disseruit morem fuisse maioribus , quoties dirimerent amicitias , interdicere domo eumque finem gratiae ponere$$ The emperor ,  however ,  argued in a letter to the Senate that it had been the practice of our ancestors ,  whenever they broke off an intimacy ,  to forbid the person their house ,  and so put an end to friendship
 id se repetivisse in Labeone , atque illum , quia male administratae provinciae aliorumque criminum urgebatur , culpam invidia velavisse , frustra conterrita uxore , quam etsi nocentem periculi tamen expertem fuisse$$ This usage he had himself revived in Labeo's case ,  but Labeo ,  being pressed by charges of maladministration in his province and other crimes ,  had screened his guilt by bringing odium on another ,  and had groundlessly alarmed his wife ,  who ,  though criminal ,  was still free from danger
 Mamercus dein Scaurus rursum postulatur , insignis nobilitate et orandis causis , vita probrosus$$ Mamercus Scaurus was then for the second time impeached ,  a man of distinguished rank and ability as an advocate ,  but of infamous life
 nihil hunc amicitia Seiani , sed labefecit haud minus validum ad exitia Macronis odium , qui easdem artes occultius exercebat detuleratque argumentum tragoediae a Scauro scriptae , additis versibus qui in Tiberium flecterentur$$ He fell ,  not through the friendship of Sejanus ,  but through what was no less powerful to destroy ,  the enmity of Macro ,  who practised the same arts more secretly Macro's information was grounded on the subject of a tragedy written by Scaurus ,  from which he cited some verses which might be twisted into allusions to Tiberius
 verum ab Servilio et Cornelio accusatoribus adulterium Liviae , magorum sacra obiectabantur$$ But Servilius and Cornelius ,  his accusers ,  alleged adultery with Livia and the practice of magical rites
 Scaurus , ut dignum veteribus Aemiliis , damnationem antiit , hortante Sextia uxore , quae incitamentum mortis et particeps fuit$$ Scaurus ,  as befitted the old house of the Aemilii ,  forestalled the fatal sentence at the persuasion of his wife Sextia ,  who urged him to die and shared his death
 Ac tamen accusatores , si facultas incideret , poenis adficiebantur , ut Servilius Corneliusque perdito Scauro famosi , quia pecuniam a Vario Ligure omittendae delationis ceperant , in insulas interdicto igni atque aqua demoti sunt$$ Still the informers were punished when ever an opportunity occurred Servilius and Cornelius ,  for example ,  whom the destruction of Scaurus had made notorious ,  were outlawed and transported to some islands for having taken money from Varius Ligur for dropping a prosecution
 et Abudius Ruso functus aedilitate , dum Lentulo Gaetulico , sub quo legioni praefuerat , periculum facessit quod is Seiani filium generum destinasset , ultro damnatur atque urbe exigitur$$ Abudius Ruso too ,  who had been an aedile ,  in seeking to imperil Lentulus Gaetulicus ,  under whom he had commanded a legion ,  by alleging that he had fixed on a son of Sejanus for his son-in-law ,  was himself actually condemned and banished from Rome
 Gaetulicus ea tempestate superioris Germaniae legiones curabat mirumque amorem adsecutus erat , effusae clementiae , modicus severitate et proximo quoque exercitui per Lucius Apronium socerum non ingratus$$ Gaetulicus at this time was in charge of the legions of Upper Germany ,  and had won from them singular affection ,  as a man of unbounded kindliness ,  moderate in his strictness ,  and popular even with the neighbouring army through his father-in-law ,  Lucius Apronius
 unde fama constans ausum mittere ad Caesarem litteras , adfinitatem sibi cum Seiano haud sponte sed consilio Tiberii coeptam$$ Hence rumour persistently affirmed that he had ventured to send the emperor a letter ,  reminding him that his alliance with Sejanus had not originated in his own choice ,  but in the advice of Tiberius
 perinde se quam Tiberium falli potuisse , neque errorem eundem illi sine fraude , aliis exitio habendum$$ that he was himself as liable to be deceived as Tiberius ,  and that the same mistake ought not to be held innocent in the prince and be a source of ruin to others
 sibi fidem integram et , si nullis insidiis peteretur , mansuram$$ His loyalty was still untainted and would so remain ,  if he was not assaIled by any plot
 successorem non aliter quam indicium mortis accepturum$$ A successor he should accept as an announcement of his doom
 firmarent velut foedus , quo princeps ceterarum rerum poteretur , ipse provinciam retineret$$ A compact ,  so to say ,  ought to be sealed between them ,  by which he should retain his province ,  and the emperor be master of all else
 haec , mira quamquam , fidem ex eo trahebant quod unus omnium Seiani adfinium incolumis multaque gratia mansit , reputante Tiberio publicum sibi odium , extremam aetatem magisque fama quam vi stare res suas$$ Strange as this story was ,  it derived credibility from the fact that Gaetulicus alone of all connected with Sejanus lived in safety and in high favour ,  Tiberius bearing in mind the people's hatred ,  his own extreme age how his government rested more on prestige than on power
 Gaius Cestio Marcus Servilio consulibus nobiles Parthi in urbem venere , ignaro rege Artabano$$ In the consulship of Caius Cestius and Marcus Servilius ,  some Parthian nobles came to Rome without the knowledge of their king Artabanus
 is metu Germanici fidus Romanis , aequabilis in suos , mox superbiam in nos , saevitiam in popularis sumpsit , fretus bellis quae secunda adversum circumiectas nationes exercuerat , et senectutem Tiberii ut inermem despiciens avidusque Armeniae , cui defuncto rege Artaxia Arsacen liberorum suorum veterrimum imposuit , addita contumelia et missis qui gazam a Vonone relictam in Syria Ciliciaque reposcerent$$ Dread of Germanicus had made that prince faithful to the Romans and just to his people ,  but he subsequently changed this behaviour for insolence towards us and tyranny to his subjects He was elated by the wars which he had successfully waged against the surrounding nations ,  while he disdained the aged and ,  as he thought ,  unwarlike Tiberius ,  eagerly coveting Armenia ,  over which ,  on the death of Artaxias ,  he placed Arsaces ,  his eldest son He further added insult ,  and sent envoys to reclaim the treasures left by Vonones in Syria and Cilicia
 simul veteres Persarum ac Macedonum terminos seque invasurum possessa Cyro et post Alexandro per vaniloquentiam ac minas iaciebat$$ Then too he insisted on the ancient boundaries of Persia and Macedonia ,  and intimated ,  with a vainglorious threat ,  that he meant to seize on the country possessed by Cyrus and afterwards by Alexander
 sed Parthis mittendi secretos nuntios validissimus auctor fuit Sinnaces , insigni familia ac perinde opibus , et proximus huic Abdus ademptae virilitatis$$ The chief adviser of the Parthians in sending the secret embassy was Sinnaces ,  a man of distinguished family and corresponding wealth Next in influence was Abdus ,  an eunuch ,  a class which ,  far from being despised among barbarians ,  actually possesses power
 non despectum id apud barbaros ultroque potentiam habet ii adscitis et aliis primoribus , quia neminem gentis Arsacidarum summae rei imponere poterant , interfectis ab Artabano plerisque aut nondum adultis , Phraaten regis Phraatis filium Roma poscebant$$ These ,  with some other nobles whom they admitted to their counsels ,  as there was not a single Arsacid whom they could put on the throne ,  most of the family having been murdered by Artabanus or being under age ,  demanded that Phraates ,  son of king Phraates ,  should be sent from Rome
 nomine tantum et auctore opus ut sponte Caesaris ut genus Arsacis ripam apud Euphratis cerneretur$$ Only a name ,  they said ,  and an authority were wanted only ,  in fact ,  that ,  with Caesar's consent ,  a scion of the house of Arsaces should show himself on the banks of the Euphrates
 Cupitum id Tiberio$$ This suited the wishes of Tiberius
 ornat Phraaten accingitque paternum ad fastigium , destinata retinens , consiliis et astu res externas moliri , arma procul habere$$ He provided Phraates with what he needed for assuming his father's sovereignty ,  while he clung to his purpose of regulating foreign affairs by a crafty policy and keeping war at a distance
 interea cognitis insidiis Artabanus tardari metu , modo cupidine vindictae inardescere$$ Artabanus meanwhile ,  hearing of the treacherous arrangement ,  was one moment perplexed by apprehension ,  the next fired with a longing for revenge
 et barbaris cunctatio servilis , statim exequi regium videtur$$ With barbarians ,  indecision is a slave's weakness
 valuit tamen utilitas , ut Abdum specie amicitiae vocatum ad epulas lento veneno inligaret , Sinnacen dissimulatione ac donis , simul per negotia moraretur$$ prompt action king-like But now expediency prevailed ,  and he invited Abdus ,  under the guise of friendship ,  to a banquet ,  and disabled him by a lingering poison
 et Phraates apud Syriam dum omisso cultu Romano , cui per tot annos insueverat , instituta Parthorum sumit , patriis moribus impar morbo absumptus est sed non Tiberius omisit incepta$$ Sinnaces he put off by pretexts and presents ,  and also by various employments Phraates meanwhile ,  on arriving in Syria ,  where he threw off the Roman fashions to which for so many years he had been accustomed ,  and adapted himself to Parthian habits ,  unable to endure the customs of his country ,  was carried off by an illness
 Tiridaten sanguinis eiusdem aemulum Artabano reciperandaeque Armeniae Hiberum Mithridaten deligit conciliatque fratri Pharasmani , qui gentile imperium obtinebat$$ Still ,  Tiberius did not relinquish his purpose He chose Tiridates ,  of the same stock as Artabanus ,  to be his rival ,  and the Iberian Mithridates to be the instrument of recovering Armenia ,  having reconciled him to his brother Pharasmanes ,  who held the throne of that country
 et cunctis quae apud Orientem parabantur Lucius Vitellium praefecit$$ He then intrusted the whole of his eastern policy to Lucius Vitellius
 eo de homine haud sum ignarus sinistram in urbe famam , pleraque foeda memorari$$ The man ,  I am aware ,  had a bad name at Rome ,  and many a foul story was told of him
 ceterum regendis provinciis prisca virtute egit$$ But in the government of provinces he acted with the virtue of ancient times
 unde regressus et formidine G Caesaris , familiaritate Claudii turpe in servitium mutatus exemplar apud posteros adulatorii dedecoris habetur , cesseruntque prima postremis , et bona iuventae senectus flagitiosa oblitteravit$$ He returned ,  and then ,  through fear of Caius Caesar and intimacy with Claudius ,  he degenerated into a servility so base that he is regarded by an after-generation as the type of the most degrading adulation The beginning of his career was forgotten in its end ,  and an old age of infamy effaced the virtues of youth
 Enimvero apud Sarmatas non una vox ducis$$ Among the Sarmatae the general's voice was not alone to be heard
 se quisque stimulant ne pugnam per sagittas sinerent$$ They encouraged one another not to begin the battle with volleys of arrows
 impetu et comminus praeveniendum$$ they must ,  they said ,  anticipate attack by a hand to hand charge
 variae hinc bellantium species , cum Parthus sequi vel fugere pari arte suetus distraheret turmas , spatium ictibus quaereret , Sarmatae omisso arcu , quo brevius valent , contis gladiisque ruerent$$ Then followed every variety of conflict The Parthians ,  accustomed to pursue or fly with equal science ,  deployed their squadrons ,  and sought scope for their missiles The Sarmatae ,  throwing aside their bows ,  which at a shorter range are effective ,  rushed on with pikes and swords
 modo equestris proelii more frontis et tergi vices , aliquando ut conserta acies corporibus et pulsu armorum pellerent pellerentur$$ Sometimes ,  as in a cavalry-action ,  there would be alternate advances and retreats ,  then ,  again ,  close fighting ,  in which ,  breast to breast ,  with the clash of arms ,  they repulsed the foe or were themselves repulsed
 iamque et Albani Hiberique prensare , detrudere , ancipitem pugnam hostibus facere , quos super eques et propioribus vulneribus pedites adflictabant$$ And now the Albanians and Iberians seized ,  and hurled the Parthians from their steeds ,  and embarrassed their enemy with a double attack ,  pressed as they were by the cavalry on the heights and by the nearer blows of the infantry
 inter quae Pharasmanes Orodesque , dum strenuis adsunt aut dubitantibus subveniunt , conspicui eoque gnari , clamore telis equis concurrunt , instantius Pharasmanes$$ Meanwhile Pharasmanes and Orodes ,  who ,  as they cheered on the brave and supported the wavering ,  were conspicuous to all ,  and so recognised each other ,  rushed to the combat with a shout ,  with javelins ,  and galloping chargers ,  Pharasmanes with the greater impetuosity ,  for he pierced his enemy's helmet at a stroke

 quidam callidius interpretabantur initia conatus secunda neque diuturna , quia eorum quae terra caelove portenderentur certior fides , fluminum instabilis natura simul ostenderet omina raperetque$$ Some explained it with more subtlety ,  of a successful commencement to the enterprise ,  which ,  however ,  would not be lasting ,  on the ground ,  that though a confident trust might be placed in prognostics given in the earth or in the heavens ,  the fluctuating character of rivers exhibited omens which vanished the same moment
 sed ponte navibus effecto tramissoque exercitu primus Ornospades multis equitum milibus in castra venit , exul quondam et Tiberio , cum Delmaticum bellum conficeret , haud inglorius auxiliator eoque civitate Romana donatus , mox repetita amicitia regis multo apud eum honore , praefectus campis qui Euphrate et Tigre inclutis amnibus circumflui Mesopotamiae nomen acceperunt$$ A bridge of boats having been constructed and the army having crossed ,  the first to enter the camp was Ornospades ,  with several thousand cavalry Formerly an exile ,  he had rendered conspicuous aid to Tiberius in the completion of the Dalmatic war ,  and had for this been rewarded with Roman citizenship Subsequently ,  he had again sought the friendship of his king ,  by whom he had been raised to high honour ,  and appointed governor of the plains ,  which ,  being surrounded by the waters of those famous rivers ,  the Euphrates and Tigris ,  have received the name of Mesopotamia

 quae ab heredibus occultata recitari Tiberius iussit , patientiam libertatis alienae ostentans et contemptor suae infamiae , an scelerum Seiani diu nescius mox quoquo modo dicta vulgari malebat veritatisque , cui adulatio officit , per probra saltem gnarus fieri$$ Tiberius ordered these insults ,  which Trio's heirs had suppressed ,  to be publicly read ,  thus showing his tolerance of free speech in others and despising his own shame ,  or ,  possibly ,  because he had long been ignorant of the villanies of Sejanus ,  and now wished any remarks ,  however reckless ,  to published ,  and so to ascertain ,  through invective ,  if it must be so ,  the truth ,  which flattery obscures

 Per idem tempus Clitarum natio Cappadoci Archelao subiecta , quia nostrum in modum deferre census , pati tributa adigebatur , in iuga Tauri montis abscessit locorumque ingenio sese contra imbellis regis copias tutabatur , donec Marcus Trebellius legatus , a Vitellio praeside Syriae cum quattuor milibus legionariorum et delectis auxiliis missus , duos collis quos barbari insederant (minori Cadra , alteri Davara nomen est) operibus circumdedit et erumpere ausos ferro , ceteros siti ad deditionem coegit$$ At this same time the Clitae ,  a tribe subject to the Cappadocian Archelaus ,  retreated to the heights of Mount Taurus ,  because they were compelled in Roman fashion to render an account of their revenue and submit to tribute There they defended themselves by means of the nature of the country against the king's unwarlike troops ,  till Marcus Trebellius ,  whom Vitellius ,  the governor of Syria ,  sent as his lieutenant with four thousand legionaries and some picked auxiliaries ,  surrounded with his lines two hills occupied by the barbarians ,  the lesser of which was named Cadra ,  the other Davara Those who dared to sally out ,  he reduced to surrender by the sword ,  the rest by drought

 et motos senatu excusatosque simul propositurum ut iudicium censorum ac pudor sponte cedentium permixta ignominiam mollirent$$ He would publish in the same list those who had been expelled and those who had been allowed to retire ,  that by this confounding together of the decision of the censors and the modesty of voluntary resignation the disgrace might be softened

 rursus ipsa facilitas imperatoris fiduciam dabat , si atrocitate criminis praevaluissent , posse opprimi damnatam ante quam ream$$ On the other hand ,  the very good nature of the emperor inspired confident hope that if they could overpower him by the enormity of the charge ,  she might be condemned and crushed before she was accused

 Exim Calpurnia (id paelici nomen) , ubi datum secretum , genibus Caesaris provoluta nupsisse Messalinam Silio exclamat$$ On this ,  Calpurnia (that was the woman's name) ,  as soon as she was allowed a private interview ,  threw herself at the emperor's knees ,  crying out that Messalina was married to Silius

 Crebra post haec fama fuit , inter diversas principis voces , cum modo incusaret flagitia uxoris , aliquando ad memoriam coniugii et infantiam liberorum revolveretur , non aliud prolocutum Vitellium quam ïo facinus! o scelus! instabat quidem Narcissus aperire ambages et veri copiam facere sed non ideo pervicit quin suspensa et quo ducerentur inclinatura responderet exemploque eius Largus Caecina uteretur$$ It was currently reported in after times that while the emperor broke into contradictory exclamations ,  now inveighing against the infamies of his wife ,  and now ,  returning in thought to the remembrance of his love and of his infant children ,  Vitellius said nothing but ,  What audacity! what wickedness!

 at Agrippina ne malis tantum facinoribus notesceret veniam exilii pro Annaeo Seneca , simul praeturam impetrat , laetum in publicum rata ob claritudinem studiorum eius , utque Domitii pueritia tali magistro adolesceret et consiliis eiusdem ad spem dominationis uterentur , quia Seneca fidus in Agrippinam memoria beneficii et infensus Claudio dolore iniuriae credebatur$$ Agrippina ,  that she might not be conspicuous only by her evil deeds ,  procured for Annaeus Seneca a remission of his exile ,  and with it the praetorship She thought this would be universally welcome ,  from the celebrity of his attainments ,  and it was her wish too for the boyhood of Domitius to be trained under so excellent an instructor ,  and for them to have the benefit of his counsels in their designs on the throne For Seneca ,  it was believed ,  was devoted to Agrippina from a remembrance of her kindness ,  and an enemy to Claudius from a bitter sense of wrong
 Placitum dehinc non ultra cunctari , sed designatum consulem Mammium Pollionem ingentibus promissis inducunt sententiam expromere , qua oraretur Claudius despondere Octaviam Domitio , quod aetati utriusque non absurdum et maiora patefacturum erat$$ It was then resolved to delay no longer Memmius Pollio ,  the consul-elect ,  was induced by great promises to deliver a speech ,  praying Claudius to betroth Octavia to Domitius The match was not unsuitable to the age of either ,  and was likely to develop still more important results Pollio introduced the motion in much the same language as Vitellius had lately used
 Pollio haud disparibus verbis ac nuper Vitellius censet despondeturque Octavia , ac super priorem necessitudinem sponsus iam et gener Domitius aequari Britannico studiis matris , arte eorum quis ob accusatam Messalinam ultio ex filio timebatur$$ So Octavia was betrothed ,  and Domitius ,  besides his previous relationship ,  became now the emperor's affianced son-in-law ,  and an equal of Britannicus ,  through the exertions of his mother and the cunning of those who had been the accusers of Messalina ,  and feared the vengeance of her son
 Per idem tempus legati Parthorum ad expetendum , ut rettuli , Meherdaten missi senatum ingrediuntur mandataque in hunc modum incipiunt$$ About the same time an embassy from the Parthians ,  which had been sent ,  as I have stated ,  to solicit the return of Meherdates ,  was introduced into the Senate ,  and delivered a message to the following effect 
 non se foederis ignaros nec defectione a familia Arsacidarum venire , set filium Vononis , nepotem Pharaatis accersere adversus dominationem Gotarzis nobilitati plebique iuxta intolerandam$$ They were not ,  they said ,  unaware of the treaty of alliance ,  nor did their coming imply any revolt from the family of the Arsacids indeed ,  even the son of Vonones ,  Phraates's grandson ,  was with them in their resistance to the despotism of Gotarzes ,  which was alike intolerable to the nobility and to the people
 iam fratres , iam propinquos , iam longius sitos caedibus exhaustos$$ Already brothers ,  relatives ,  and distant kin had been swept off by murder after murder
 adici coniuges gravidas , liberos parvos , dum socors domi , bellis infaustus ignaviam saevitia tegat$$ wives actually pregnant ,  and tender children were added to Gotarzes' victims ,  while ,  slothful at home and unsuccessful in war ,  he made cruelty a screen for his feebleness
 veterem sibi ac publice coeptam nobiscum amicitiam , et subveniendum sociis virium aemulis cedentibusque per reverentiam$$ Between the Parthians and ourselves there was an ancient friendship ,  founded on a state alliance ,  and we ought to support allies who were our rivals in strength ,  and yet yielded to us out of respect
 ideo regum obsides liberos dari ut , si domestici imperii taedeat , sit regressus ad principem patresque , quorum moribus adsuefactus rex melior adscisceretur$$ Kings' sons were given as hostages ,  in order that when Parthia was tired of home rule ,  it might fall back on the emperor and the Senate ,  and receive from them a better sovereign ,  familiar with Roman habits
 Vbi haec atque talia dissertavere , incipit orationem Caesar de fastigio Romano Parthorumque obsequiis , seque divo Augusto adaequabat , petitum ab eo regem referens omissa Tiberii memoria , quamquam is quoque miserat$$ In answer to these and like arguments Claudius began to speak of the grandeur of Rome and the submissive attitude of the Parthians He compared himself to the Divine Augustus ,  from whom ,  he reminded them ,  they had sought a king ,  but omitted to mention Tiberius ,  though he too had sent them sovereigns
 addidit praecepta (etenim aderat Meherdates) , ut non dominationem et servos , sed rectorem et civis cogitaret , clementiamque ac iustitiam , quanto ignota barbaris , tanto laetiora capesseret$$ He added some advice for Meherdates ,  who was present ,  and told him not to be thinking of a despot and his slaves ,  but rather of a ruler among fellow citizens ,  and to practise clemency and justice which barbarians would like the more for being unused to them
 hinc versus ad legatos extollit laudibus alumnum urbis , spectatae ad id modestiae$$ Then he turned to the envoys and bestowed high praise on the young foster-son of Rome ,  as one whose self-control had hitherto been exemplary

 Ea tempestate Cassius ceteros praeminebat peritia legum$$ Cassius was at that time pre-eminent for legal learning
 nam militares artes per otium ignotae , industriosque aut ignavos pax in aequo tenet$$ The profession of the soldier is forgotten in a quiet period ,  and peace reduces the enterprising and indolent to an equality
 ac tamen quantum sine bello dabatur , revocare priscum morem , exercitare legiones , cura provisu perinde agere ac si hostis ingrueret$$ But Cassius ,  as far as it was possible without war ,  revived ancient discipline ,  kept exercising the legions ,  in short ,  used as much diligence and precaution as if an enemy were threatening him
 ita dignum maioribus suis et familia Cassia per illas quoque gentis celebrata$$ This conduct he counted worthy of his ancestors and of the Cassian family which had won renown even in those countries
 igitur excitis quorum de sententia petitus rex , positisque castris apud Zeugma , unde maxime pervius amnis , postquam inlustres Parthi rexque Arabum Acbarus advenerat , monet Meherdaten barbarorum impetus acris cunctatione languescere aut in perfidiam mutari$$ He then summoned those at whose suggestion a king had been sought from Rome ,  and having encamped at Zeugma where the river was most easily fordable and awaited the arrival of the chief men of Parthia and of Acbarus ,  king of the Arabs ,  he reminded Meherdates that the impulsive enthusiasm of barbarians soon flags from delay or even changes into treachery ,  and that therefore he should urge on his enterprise
 ita urgeret coepta quod spretum fraude Acbari , qui iuvenem ignarum et summam fortunam in luxu ratum multos per dies attinuit apud oppidum Edessam$$ The advice was disregarded through the perfidy Acbarus ,  by whom the foolish young prince ,  who thought that the highest position merely meant self-indulgence ,  was detained for several days in the town of Edessa

 sic pulsus hostis , ventumque Sozam , oppidum Dandaricae , quod desertum a Mithridate ob ambiguos popularium animos obtineri relicto ibi praesidio visum$$ Thus the enemy was defeated ,  and they reached Soza ,  a town in Dandarica ,  which Mithridates had abandoned ,  where it was thought expedient to leave a garrison ,  as the temper of the people was uncertain
 exim in Siracos pergunt , et transgressi amnem Pandam circumveniunt urbem Vspen , editam loco et moenibus ac fossis munitam , nisi quod moenia non saxo sed cratibus et vimentis ac media humo adversum inrumpentis invalida erant$$ Next they marched on the Siraci ,  and after crossing the river Panda besieged the city of Uspe ,  which stood on high ground ,  and had the defence of wall and fosses only the walls ,  not being of stone ,  but of hurdles and wicker-work with earth between ,  were too weak to resist an assault

 Gaius Antistio Marcus Suillio consulibus adoptio in Domitium auctoritate Pallantis festinatur , qui obstrictus Agrippinae ut conciliator nuptiarum et mox stupro eius inligatus , stimulabat Claudium consuleret rei publicae , Britannici pueritiam robore circumdaret sic apud divum Augustum , quamquam nepotibus subnixum , viguisse privignos$$ In the consulship of Caius Antistius and Marcus Suilius ,  the adoption of Domitius was hastened on by the influence of Pallas Bound to Agrippina ,  first as the promoter of her marriage ,  then as her paramour ,  he still urged Claudius to think of the interests of the State ,  and to provide some support for the tender years of Britannicus So ,  he said ,  it had been with the Divine Augustus ,  whose stepsons ,  though he had grandsons to be his stay ,  had been promoted

 Prima novo principatu mors Iunii Silani proconsulis Asiae ignaro Nerone per dolum Agrippinae paratur , non quia ingenii violentia exitium inritaverat , segnis et dominationibus aliis fastiditus , adeo ut Gaius Caesar pecudem auream eum appellare solitus sit$$ THE first death under the new emperor ,  that of Junius Silanus ,  proconsul of Asia ,  was ,  without Nero's knowledge ,  planned by the treachery of Agrippina Not that Silanus had provoked destruction by any violence of temper ,  apathetic as he was ,  and so utterly despised under former despotisms ,  that Caius Caesar used to call him the golden sheep
 verum Agrippina fratri eius Lucius Silano necem molita ultorem metuebat , crebra vulgi fama anteponendum esse vixdum pueritiam egresso Neroni et imperium per scelus adepto virum aetate composita insontem , nobilem et , quod tunc spectaretur , e Caesarum posteris$$ The truth was that Agrippina ,  having contrived the murder of his brother Lucius Silanus ,  dreaded his vengeance for it was the incessant popular talk that preference ought to be given over Nero ,  who was scarcely out of his boyhood and had gained the empire by crime ,  to a man of mature age ,  of blameless life ,  of noble birth ,  and ,  as a point then much regarded ,  of the line of the Caesars
 quippe et Silanus divi Augusti abnepos erat$$ Silanus in fact was the son of a great-grandson of Augustus
 haec causa necis$$ This was the cause of his destruction

 Ibaturque in caedes , nisi Afranius Burrus et Annaeus Seneca obviam issent$$ And now they had proceeded to further murders but for the opposition of Afranius Burrus and Annaeus Seneca
 hi rectores imperatoriae iuventae et , rarum in societate potentiae , concordes , diversa arte ex aequo pollebant , Burrus militaribus curis et severitate morum , Seneca praeceptis eloquentiae et comitate honesta , iuvantes in vicem , quo facilius lubricam principis aetatem , si virtutem aspernaretur , voluptatibus concessis retinerent$$ These two men guided the emperor's youth with an unity of purpose seldom found where authority is shared ,  and though their accomplishments were wholly different ,  they had equal influence Burrus ,  with his soldier's discipline and severe manners ,  Seneca ,  with lessons of eloquence and a dignified courtesy ,  strove alike to confine the frailty of the prince's youth ,  should he loathe virtue ,  within allowable indulgences
 certamen utrique unum erat contra ferociam Agrippinae , quae cunctis malae dominationis cupidinibus flagrans habebat in partibus Pallantem , quo auctore Claudius nuptiis incestis et adoptione exitiosa semet perverterat$$ They had both alike to struggle against the domineering spirit of Agrippina ,  who inflamed with all the passions of an evil ascendency had Pallas on her side ,  at whose suggestion Claudius had ruined himself by an incestuous marriage and a fatal adoption of a son
 sed neque Neroni infra servos ingenium , et Pallas tristi adrogantia modum liberti egressus taedium sui moverat$$ Nero's temper however was not one to submit to slaves ,  and Pallas ,  by a surly arrogance quite beyond a freedman ,  had provoked disgust
 propalam tamen omnes in eam honores cumulabantur , signumque more militiae petenti tribuno dedit optimae matris$$ Still every honour was openly heaped on Agrippina ,  and to a tribune who according to military custom asked the watchword ,  Nero gave the best of mothers
 decreti et a senatu duo lictores , flamonium Claudiale , simul Claudio censorium funus et mox consecratio$$ The Senate also decreed her two lictors ,  with the office of priestess to Claudius ,  and voted to the late emperor a censor's funeral ,  which was soon followed by deification

 postquam ad providentiam sapientiamque flexit , nemo risui temperare , quamquam oratio a Seneca composita multum cultus praeferret , ut fuit illi viro ingenium amoenum et temporis eius auribus accommodatum$$ When the speaker passed on to his foresight and wisdom ,  no one could refrain from laughter ,  though the speech ,  which was composed by Seneca ,  exhibited much elegance ,  as indeed that famous man had an attractive genius which suited the popular ear of the time
 adnotabant seniores quibus otiosum est vetera et praesentia contendere , primum ex iis , qui rerum potiti essent , Neronem alienae facundiae eguisse$$ Elderly men who amuse their leisure with comparing the past and the present ,  observed that Nero was the first emperor who needed another man's eloquence

 tum formam futuri principis praescripsit , ea maxime declinans , quorum recens flagrabat invidia$$ He then sketched the plan of his future government ,  carefully avoiding anything which had kindled recent odium
 non enim se negotiorum omnium iudicem fore , ut clausis unam intra domum accusatoribus et reis paucorum potentia grassaretur$$ He would not ,  he said ,  be judge in all cases ,  or ,  by confining the accuser and the accused within the same walls ,  let the power of a few favourites grow dangerously formidable

 quod quidem adversante Agrippina , tamquam acta Claudii subverterentur , obtinuere patres , qui in Palatium ob id vocabantur , ut adstaret additis a tergo foribus velo discreta , quod visum arceret , auditus non adimeret$$ This was opposed by Agrippina ,  as a reversal of the legislation of Claudius ,  but it was carried by the senators who used to be summoned to the palace ,  in order that she might stand close to a hidden door behind them ,  screened by a curtain which was enough to shut her out of sight ,  but not out of hearing
 quin et legatis Armeniorum causam gentis apud Neronem orantibus escendere suggestum imperatoris et praesidere simul parabat , nisi ceteris pavore defixis Seneca admonuisset , venienti matri occurrere$$ When envoys from Armenia were pleading their nation's cause before Nero ,  she actually was on the point of mounting the emperor's tribunal and of presiding with him but Seneca ,  when every one else was paralysed with alarm ,  motioned to the prince to go and meet his mother
 ita specie pietatis obviam itum dedecori$$ Thus ,  by an apparently dutiful act ,  a scandalous scene was prevented
 Sed apud senatum omnia in maius celebrata sunt sententiis eorum , qui supplicationes et diebus supplicationum vestem principi triumphalem , utque ovans urbem iniret , effigiemque eius pari magnitudine ac Martis Ultoris eodem in templo censuere , praeter suetam adulationem laeti , quod Domitium Corbulonem retinendae Armeniae praeposuerat videbaturque locus virtutibus patefactus$$ All this however was described with exaggeration to the Senate ,  in the speeches of those members who proposed a public thanksgiving ,  and that on the days of the thanksgiving the prince should wear the triumphal robe and enter Rome in ovation ,  lastly ,  that he should have statues on the same scale as those of Mars the Avenger ,  and in the same temple To their habitual flattery was added a real joy at his having appointed Domitius Corbulo to secure Armenia ,  thus opening ,  as it seemed ,  a field to merit
 copiae Orientis ita dividuntur , ut pars auxiliarium cum duabus legionibus apud provinciam Syriam et legatum eius Quadratum Ummidium remaneret , par civium sociorumque numerus Corbuloni esset , additis cohortibus alisque , quae in Cappadocia hiemabant$$ The armies of the East were so divided that half the auxiliaries and two legions were to remain in the province of Syria under its governor ,  Quadratus Ummidius while Corbulo was to have an equal number of citizen and allied troops ,  together with the auxiliary infantry and cavalry which were in winter quarters in Cappadocia
 socii reges , prout bello conduceret , parere iussi$$ The confederate kings were instructed to obey orders ,  just as the war might require
 sed studia eorum in Corbulonem promptiora erant$$ But they had a specially strong liking for Corbulo
 qui ut instaret famae , quae in novis coeptis validissima est , itinere propere confecto apud Aegeas civitatem Ciliciae obvium Quadratum habuit , illuc progressum , ne , accipiendas copias Syriam intravisset Corbulo , omnium ora in se verteret , corpore ingens , verbis magnificis et super experientiam sapientiamque etiam specie inanium validus$$ That general ,  with a view to the prestige which in a new enterprise is supremely powerful ,  speedily accomplished his march ,  and at Aegeae ,  a city of Cilicia ,  met Quadratus who had advanced to the place under an apprehension that ,  should Corbulo once enter Armenia to take command of the army ,  he would draw all eyes on himself ,  by his noble stature ,  his imposing eloquence ,  and the impression he would make ,  not only by his wisdom and experience ,  but also by the mere display of showy attributes
 Eodem anno Caesar effigiem Gnaeus Domitio patri et consularia insignia Asconio Labeoni , quo tutore usus erat , petivit a senatu$$ The emperor in the same year asked the Senate for a statue to his father Domitius ,  and also that the consular decorations might be conferred on Asconius Labeo ,  who had been his guardian
 sibique statuas argento vel auro solidas adversus offerentes prohibuit et quamquam censuissent patres , ut principium anni mense Decembri , quo ortus erat Nero , veterem religionem kalendarum Ianuariarum inchoando anno retinuit$$ Statues to himself of solid gold and silver he forbade ,  in opposition to offers made ,  and although the Senate passed a vote that the year should begin with the month of December ,  in which he was born ,  he retained for its commencement ,  the old sacred associations of the first of January
 neque recepti sunt inter reos Carrinas Celer senator servo accusante , aut Iulius Densus equester Romanus , cui favor in Britannicum crimini dabatur$$ Nor would he allow the prosecution of Carinas Celer ,  a senator ,  whom a slave accused ,  or of Julius Densus ,  a knight ,  whose partiality for Britannicus was construed into a crime
 Ceterum infracta paulatim potentia matris delapso Nerone in amorem libertae , cui vocabulum Acte fuit , simul adsumptis in conscientiam Marcus Othone et Claudio Senecione , adulescentulis decoris , quorum Otho familia consulari , Senecio liberto Caesaris patre genitus$$ Meanwhile the mother's influence was gradually weakened ,  as Nero fell in love with a freedwoman ,  Acte by name ,  and took into his confidence Otho and Claudius Senecio ,  two young men of fashion ,  the first of whom was descended from a family of consular rank ,  while Senecio's father was one of the emperor's freedmen
 ignara matre , dein frustra obnitente , penitus inrepserat per luxum et ambigua secreta , ne senioribus quidem principis amicis adversantibus , muliercula nulla cuiusquam iniuria cupidines principis explente , quando uxore ab Octavia , nobili quidem et probitatis spectatae , fato quodam , an quia praevalent inlicita , abhorrebat , metuebaturque , ne in stupra feminarum inlustrium prorumperet , si illa libidine prohiberetur$$ Without the mother's knowledge ,  then in spite of her opposition ,  they had crept into his favour by debaucheries and equivocal secrets ,  and even the prince's older friends did not thwart him ,  for here was a girl who without harm to any one gratified his desires ,  when he loathed his wife Octavia ,  high born as she was ,  and of approved virtue ,  either from some fatality ,  or because vice is overpoweringly attractive It was feared too that he might rush into outrages on noble ladies ,  were he debarred from this indulgence
 Sed Agrippina libertam aemulam , nurum ancillam aliaque eundem in modum muliebriter fremere , neque paenitentiam filii aut satietatem opperiri , quantoque foediora exprobrabat , acrius accendere , donec vi amoris subactus exueret obsequium in matrem seque Senecae permitteret , ex cuius familiaribus Annaeus Serenus simulatione amoris adversus eandem libertam primas adulescentis cupidines velaverat praebueratque nomen , ut quae princeps furtim mulierculae tribuebat , ille palam largiretur$$ Agrippina ,  however ,  raved with a woman's fury about having a freedwoman for a rival ,  a slave girl for a daughter-in-law ,  with like expressions Nor would she wait till her son repented or wearied of his passion The fouler her reproaches ,  the more powerfully did they inflame him ,  till completely mastered by the strength of his desire ,  he threw off all respect for his mother ,  and put himself under the guidance of Seneca ,  one of whose friends ,  Annaeus Serenus ,  had veiled the young prince's intrigue in its beginning by pretending to be in love with the same woman ,  and had lent his name as the ostensible giver of the presents secretly sent by the emperor to the girl
 tum Agrippina versis artibus per blandimenta iuvenem adgredi , suum potius cubiculum ac sinum offerre contegendis quae prima aetas et summa fortuna expeterent$$ Then Agrippina ,  changing her tactics ,  plied the lad with various blandishments ,  and even offered the seclusion of her chamber for the concealment of indulgences which youth and the highest rank might claim
 quin et fatebatur intempestivam severitatem et suarum opum , quae haud procul imperatoriis aberant , copias tradebat , ut nimia nuper coercendo filio , ita rursum intemperanter demissa$$ She went further she pleaded guilty to an ill-timed strictness ,  and handed over to him the abundance of her wealth ,  which nearly approached the imperial treasures ,  and from having been of late extreme in her restraint of her son ,  became now ,  on the other hand ,  lax to excess
 quae mutatio neque Neronem fefellit , et proximi amicorum metuebant orabantque cavere insidias mulieris semper atrocis , tum et falsae$$ The change did not escape Nero his most intimate friends dreaded it ,  and begged him to beware of the arts of a woman ,  was always daring and was now false
 forte illis diebus Caesar inspecto ornatu , quo principium coniuges ac parentes effulserant , deligit vestem et gemmas misitque donum matri , nulla parsimonia , cum praecipua et cupita aliis prior deferret$$ It happened at this time that the emperor after inspecting the apparel in which wives and mothers of the imperial house had been seen to glitter ,  selected a jewelled robe and sent it as a gift to his mother ,  with the unsparing liberality of one who was bestowing by preference on her a choice and much coveted present
 sed Agrippina non his instrui cultus suos , sed ceteris arceri proclamat et dividere filium , quae cuncta ex ipsa haberet$$ Agrippina ,  however ,  publicly declared that so far from her wardrobe being furnished by these gifts ,  she was really kept out of the remainder ,  and that her son was merely dividing with her what he derived wholly from herself
 Turbatus his Nero et propinquo die , quo quartum decimum aetatis annum Britannicus explebat , volutare secum modo matris violentiam , modo ipsius indolem , levi quidem experimento nuper cognitam , quo tamen favorem late quaesivisset$$ Nero was confounded at this ,  and as the day was near on which Britannicus would complete his fourteenth year ,  he reflected ,  now on the domineering temper of his mother ,  and now again on the character of the young prince ,  which a trifling circumstance had lately tested ,  sufficient however to gain for him wide popularity
 festis Saturno diebus inter alia aequalium ludicra regnum lusu sortientium evenerat ea sors Neroni igitur ceteris diversa nec ruborem adlatura$$ During the feast of Saturn ,  amid other pastimes of his playmates ,  at a game of lot drawing for king ,  the lot fell to Nero ,  upon which he gave all his other companions different orders ,  and such as would not put them to the blush
 ubi Britannico iussit exsurgeret progressusque in medium cantum aliquem inciperet , inrisum ex eo sperans pueri sobrios quoque convictus , nedum temulentos ignorantis , ille constanter exorsus est carmen , quo evolutum eum sede patria rebusque summis significabatur$$ but when he told Britannicus to step forward and begin a song ,  hoping for a laugh at the expense of a boy who knew nothing of sober ,  much less of riotous society ,  the lad with perfect coolness commenced some verses which hinted at his expulsion from his father's house and from supreme power
 unde orta miseratio , manifestior quia dissimulationem nox et lascivia exemerat$$ This procured him pity ,  which was the more conspicuous ,  as night with its merriment had stript off all disguise
 Nero intellecta invidia odium intendit$$ Nero saw the reproach and redoubled his hate
 urgentibusque Agrippinae minis , quia nullum crimen neque iubere caedem fratris palam audebat , occulta molitur pararique venenum iubet , ministro Pollione Iulio praetoriae cohortis tribuno , cuius cura attinebatur damnata veneficii nomine Locusta , multa scelerum fama$$ Pressed by Agrippina's menaces ,  having no charge against his brother and not daring openly to order his murder ,  he meditated a secret device and directed poison to be prepared through the agency of Julius Pollio ,  tribune of one of the praetorian cohorts ,  who had in his custody a woman under sentence for poisoning ,  Locusta by name ,  with a vast reputation for crime
 nam ut proximus quisque Britannico neque fas neque fidem pensi haberet , olim provisum erat$$ That every one about the person of Britannicus should care nothing for right or honour ,  had long ago been provided for
 primum venenum ab ipsis educatoribus accepit , tramisitque exsoluta alvo parum validum , sive temperamentum inerat , ne statim saeviret$$ He actually received his first dose of poison from his tutors and passed it off his bowels ,  as it was rather weak or so qualified as not at once to prove deadly
 sed Nero lenti sceleris impatiens minitari tribuno , iubere supplicium veneficae , quod , dum rumorem respiciunt , dum parant defensiones , securitatem morarentur$$ But Nero ,  impatient at such slow progress in crime ,  threatened the tribune and ordered the poisoner to execution for prolonging his anxiety while they were thinking of the popular talk and planning their own defence
 promittentibus dein tam praecipitem necem , quam si ferro urgeretur , cubiculum Caesaris iuxta decoquitur virus cognitis antea venenis rapidum$$ Then they promised that death should be as sudden as if it were the hurried work of the dagger ,  and a rapid poison of previously tested ingredients was prepared close to the emperor's chamber
 Mos habebatur principum liberos cum ceteris idem aetatis nobilibus sedentes vesci in adspectu propinquorum propria et parciore mensa$$ It was customary for the imperial princes to sit during their meals with other nobles of the same age ,  in the sight of their kinsfolk ,  at a table of their own ,  furnished somewhat frugally
 illic epulante Britannico , quia cibos potusque eius delectus ex ministris gustu explorabat , ne omitteretur institutum aut utriusque morte proderetur scelus , talis dolus repertus est$$ There Britannicus was dining ,  and as what he ate and drank was always tested by the taste of a select attendant ,  the following device was contrived ,  that the usage might not be dropped or the crime betrayed by the death of both prince and attendant
 innoxia adhuc ac praecalida et libata gustu potio traditur Britannico$$ A cup as yet harmless ,  but extremely hot and already tasted ,  was handed to Britannicus
 dein , postquam fervore aspernabatur , frigida in aqua adfunditur venenum , quod ita cunctos eius artus pervasit , ut vox pariter et spiritus eius raperentur$$ then ,  on his refusing it because of its warmth ,  poison was poured in with some cold water ,  and this so penetrated his entire frame that he lost alike voice and breath
 trepidatur a circumsedentibus , diffugiunt imprudentes$$ There was a stir among the company
 at quibus altior intellectus , resistunt defixi et Neronem intuentes ille ut erat reclinis et nescio similis , solitum ita ait per comitialem morbum , quo prima ab infantia adflictaretur Britannicus , et redituros paulatim visus sensusque at Agrippinae is pavor , ea consternatio mentis , quamvis vultu premeretur , emicuit , ut perinde ignaram fuisse quam Octaviam sororem Britannici constiterit quippe sibi supremum auxilium ereptum et parricidii exemplum intellegebat$$ some ,  taken by surprise ,  ran hither and thither ,  while those whose discernment was keener ,  remained motionless ,  with their eyes fixed on Nero ,  who ,  as he still reclined in seeming unconsciousness ,  said that this was a common occurrence ,  from a periodical epilepsy ,  with which Britannicus had been afflicted from his earliest infancy ,  and that his sight and senses would gradually return As for Agrippina ,  her terror and confusion ,  though her countenance struggled to hide it ,  so visibly appeared ,  that she was clearly just as ignorant as was Octavia ,  Britannicus's own sister
 Octavia quoque , quamvis rudibus annis , dolorem caritatem omnes adfectus abscondere didicerat$$ She saw ,  in fact ,  that she was robbed of her only remaining refuge ,  and that here was a precedent for parricide
 ita post breve silentium repetita convivii laetitia$$ Even Octavia ,  notwithstanding her youthful inexperience ,  had learnt to hide her grief ,  her affection ,  and indeed every emotion
 Nox eadem necem Britannici et rogum coniunxit , proviso ante funebri paratu , qui modicus fuit in campo tamen Martis sepultus est , adeo turbidis imbribus , ut vulgus iram deum portendi crediderit adversus facinus , cui plerique etiam hominum ignoscebant , antiquas fratrum discordias et insociabile regnum aestimantes$$ And so after a brief pause the company resumed its mirth One and the same night witnessed Britannicus's death and funeral ,  preparations having been already made for his obsequies ,  which were on a humble scale He was however buried in the Campus Martius ,  amid storms so violent ,  that in the popular belief they portended the wrath of heaven against a crime which many were even inclined to forgive when they remembered the immemorial feuds of brothers and the impossibility of a divided throne
 tradunt plerique eorum temporum scriptores crebris ante exitium diebus inlusum isse pueritiae Britannici Neronem , ut iam non praematura neque saeva mors videri queat , quamvis inter sacra mensae , ne tempore quidem ad complexum sororum dato , ante oculos inimici properata sit in illum supremum Claudiorum sanguinem stupro prius quam veneno pollutum$$ It is related by several writers of the period that many days before the murder ,  Nero had offered the worst insult to the boyhood of Britannicus so that his death could no longer seem a premature or dreadful event ,  though it happened at the sacred board ,  without even a moment for the embraces of his sisters ,  hurried on too ,  as it was ,  under the eyes of an enemy ,  on the sole surviving offspring of the Claudii ,  the victim first of dishonour ,  then of poison
 festinationem exsequiarum edicto Caesar defendit , id a maioribus institutum referens , subtrahere oculis acerba funera neque laudationibus aut pompa detinere$$ The emperor apologised for the hasty funeral by reminding people that it was the practice of our ancestors to withdraw from view any grievously untimely death ,  and not to dwell on it with panegyrics or display
 ceterum et sibi amisso fratris auxilio reliquas spes in re publica sitas , et tanto magis fovendum patribus populoque principem , qui unus superesset e familia summum ad fastigium genita$$ For himself ,  he said ,  that as he had now lost a brother's help ,  his remaining hopes centred in the State ,  and all the more tenderness ought to be shown by the Senate and people towards a prince who was the only survivor of a family born to the highest greatness
 Exim largitione potissimos amicorum auxit$$ He then enriched his most powerful friends with liberal presents
 nec defuere qui arguerent viros gravitatem adseverantes , quod domos villas id temporis quasi praedam divisissent$$ Some there were who reproached men of austere professions with having on such an occasion divided houses and estates among themselves ,  like so much spoil
 alii necessitatem adhibitam credebant a principe , sceleris sibi conscio et veniam sperante , si largitionibus validissimum quemque obstrinxisset$$ It was the belief of others that a pressure had been put on them by the emperor ,  who ,  conscious as he was of guilt ,  hoped for merciful consideration if he could secure the most important men by wholesale bribery
 At matris ira nulla munificentia leniri , sed amplecti Octaviam , crebra cum amicis secreta habere , super ingenitam avaritiam undique pecunias quasi in subsidium corripiens , tribunos et centuriones comiter excipere , nomina et virtutes nobilium , qui etiam tum supererant , in honore habere , quasi quaereret ducem et partes$$ But his mother's rage no lavish bounty could allay She would clasp Octavia to her arms ,  and have many a secret interview with her friends with more than her natural rapacity ,  she clutched at money everywhere ,  seemingly for a reserve ,  and courteously received tribunes and centurions She honoured the names and virtues of the nobles who still were left ,  seeking apparently a party and a leader
 cognitum id Neroni , excubiasque militares , quae ut coniugi imperatoris olim , tum ut matri servabantur , et Germanos nuper eundem in honorem custodes additos digredi iubet$$ Of this Nero became aware ,  and he ordered the departure of the military guard now kept for the emperor's mother ,  as it had formerly been for the imperial consort ,  along with some German troops ,  added as a further honour
 ac ne coetu salutantium frequentaretur , separat domum matremque transfert in eam , quae Antoniae fuerat , quotiens ipse illuc ventitaret , saeptus turba centurionum et post breve osculum digrediens$$ He also gave her a separate establishment ,  that throngs of visitors might no longer wait on her ,  and removed her to what had been Antonia's house and whenever he went there himself ,  he was surrounded by a crowd of centurions ,  and used to leave her after a hurried kiss
 Nihil rerum mortalium tam instabile ac fluxum est quam fama potentiae non sua vi nixae$$ Of all things human the most precarious and transitory is a reputation for power which has no strong support of its own
 statim relictum Agrippinae limen$$ In a moment Agrippina's doors were deserted
 nemo solari , nemo adire praeter paucas feminas , amore an odio incertas$$ there was no one to comfort or to go near her ,  except a few ladies ,  whether out of love or malice was doubtful
 ex quibus erat Iunia Silana , quam matrimonio Gaius Sili a Messalina depulsam supra rettuli , insignis genere forma lascivia , et Agrippinae diu percara , mox occultis inter eas offensionibus , quia Sextium Africanum nobilem iuvenem a nuptiis Silanae deterruerat Agrippina , impudicam et vergentem annis dictitans , non ut Africanum sibi seponeret , sed ne opibus et orbitate Silanae maritus poteretur$$ One of these was Junia Silana ,  whom Messalina had driven from her husband ,  Caius Silius ,  as I have already related Conspicuous for her birth ,  her beauty ,  and her wantonness ,  she had long been a special favourite of Agrippina ,  till after a while there were secret mutual dislikes ,  because Sextius Africanus ,  a noble youth ,  had been deterred from marrying Silana by Agrippina ,  who repeatedly spoke of her as an immodest woman in the decline of life ,  not to secure Africanus for herself ,  but to keep the childless and wealthy widow out of a husband's control
 illa spe ultionis oblata parat accusatores ex clientibus suis Iturium et Calvisium , non vetera et saepius iam audita deferens , quod Britannici mortem lugeret aut Octaviae iniurias evulgaret , sed destinavisse eam Rubellium Plautum , per maternam originem pari ac Nero gradu a divo Augusto , ad res novas extollere coniugioque eius et imperio rem publicam rursus invadere$$ Silana having now a prospect of vengeance ,  suborned as accusers two of her creatures ,  Iturius and Calvisius ,  not with the old and often-repeated charges about Agrippina's mourning the death of Britannicus or publishing the wrongs of Octavia ,  but with a hint that it was her purpose to encourage in revolutionary designs Rubellius Plautus ,  who his mother's side was as nearly connected as Nero with the Divine Augustus
 haec Iturius et Calvisius Atimeto , Domitiae Neronis amitae liberto , aperiunt$$ and then ,  by marrying him and making him emperor ,  again seize the control of the State
 qui laetus oblatis (quippe inter Agrippinam et Domitiam infensa aemulatio exercebatur) Paridem histrionem , libertum et ipsum Domitiae , impulit ire propere crimenque atrociter deferre$$ All this Iturius and Calvisius divulged to Atimetus ,  a freedman of Domitia ,  Nero's aunt Exulting in the opportunity ,  for Agrippina and Domitia were in bitter rivalry ,  Atimetus urged Paris ,  who was himself also a freedman of Domitia ,  to go at once and put the charge in the most dreadful form
 Praefectura annonae Faenio Rufo , cura ludorum , qui a Caesare parabantur , Arruntio Stellae , Aegyptus Claudio Balbillo permittuntur Syria Publius Anteio destinata$$ The superintendence of the corn supply was given to Faenius Rufus ,  the direction of the games which the emperor was preparing ,  to Arruntius Stella ,  and the province of Egypt to Caius Balbillus
 sed variis mox artibus elusus , ad postremum in urbe retentus est at Silana in exilium acta$$ Syria was to be assigned to Publius Anteius ,  but he was soon put off by various artifices and finally detained at Rome
 Calvisius quoque et Iturius relegantur$$ Silana was banished Calvisius and Iturius exiled for a time
 de Atimeto supplicium sumptum , validiore apud libidines principis Paride , quam ut poena adficeretur$$ Atimetus was capitally punished ,  while Paris was too serviceable to the emperor's profligacy to allow of his suffering any penalty
 Plautus ad praesens silentio transmissus est$$ Plautus for the present was silently passed over
 Quintus Volusio Publius Scipione consulibus otium foris , foeda domi lascivia , qua Nero itinera urbis et lupanaria et deverticula veste servili in dissimulationem sui compositus pererrabat , comitantibus qui raperent venditioni exposita et obviis vulnera inferrent , adversus ignaros adeo , ut ipse quoque exciperet ictus et ore praeferret$$ In the consulship of Quintus Volusius and Publius Scipio ,  there was peace abroad ,  but a disgusting licentiousness at home on the part of Nero ,  who in a slave's disguise ,  so as to be unrecognized ,  would wander through the streets of Rome ,  to brothels and taverns ,  with comrades ,  who seized on goods exposed for sale and inflicted wounds on any whom they encountered ,  some of these last knowing him so little that he even received blows himself ,  and showed the marks of them in his face
 deinde ubi Caesarem esse , qui grassaretur , pernotuit augebanturque iniuriae adversus viros feminasque insignes , et quidam permissa semel licentia sub nomine Neronis inulti propriis cum globis eadem exercebant , in modum captivitatis nox agebatur$$ When it was notorious that the emperor was the assailant ,  and the insults on men and women of distinction were multiplied ,  other persons too on the strength of a licence once granted under Nero's name ,  ventured with impunity on the same practices ,  and had gangs of their own ,  till night presented the scenes of a captured city
 Iuliusque Montanus senatorii ordinis , sed qui nondum honorem capessisset , congressus forte per tenebras cum principe , quia vim temptantem acriter reppulerat , deinde adgnitum oraverat , quasi exprobrasset mori adactus est$$ Julius Montanus ,  a senator ,  but one who had not yet held any office ,  happened to encounter the prince in the darkness ,  and because he fiercely repulsed his attack and then on recognizing him begged for mercy ,  as though this was a reproach ,  forced to destroy himself
 Nero autem metuentior in posterum milites sibi et plerosque gladiatores circumdedit , qui rixarum initia modica et quasi privata sinerent$$ Nero was for the future more timid ,  and surrounded himself with soldiers and a number of gladiators ,  who ,  when a fray began on a small scale and seemed a private affair ,  were to let it alone ,  but ,  if the injured persons resisted stoutly ,  they rushed in with their swords
 si a laesis validius ageretur , arma inferebant ludicram quoque licentiam et fautores histrionum velut in proelia convertit impunitate et praemiis atque ipse occultus et plerumque coram prospectans , donec discordi populo et gravioris motus terrore non aliud remedium repertum est quam ut histriones Italia pellerentur milesque theatro rursum adsideret$$ He also turned the licence of the games and the enthusiasm for the actors into something like a battle by the impunity he allowed ,  and the rewards he offered ,  and especially by looking on himself ,  sometimes concealed ,  but often in public view ,  till ,  with the people at strife and the fear of a worse commotion ,  the only remedy which could be devised was the expulsion of the offending actors from Italy ,  and the presence once more of the soldiery in the theatre
 Per idem tempus actum in senatu de fraudibus libertorum , efflagitatumque ut adversus male meritos revocandae libertatis patronis daretur$$ During the same time there was a discussion in the Senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class ,  and a strong demand was made that ,  as a check on the undeserving ,  patrons should have the right of revoking freedom
 nec deerant qui censerent , sed consules , relationem incipere non ausi ignaro principe , perscripsere tamen consensum senatus ille an auctor constitutionis fieret ,    ut inter paucos et sententiae diversos , quibusdam coalitam libertate inreverentiam eo prorupisse frementibus , ut vine an aequo cum patronis iure agerent sententiam eorum consultarent ac verberibus manus ultro intenderent , impudenter vel poenam suam ipsi suadentes$$ There were several who supported this But the consuls did not venture to put the motion without the emperor's knowledge ,  though they recorded the Senate's general opinion ,  to see whether he would sanction the arrangement ,  considering that only a few were opposed to it ,  while some loudly complained that the irreverent spirit which freedom had fostered ,  had broken into such excess ,  that freedmen would ask their patrons' advice as to whether they should treat them with violence ,  or ,  as legally ,  their equals ,  and would actually threaten them with blows ,  at the same time recommending them not to punish
 quid enim aliud laeso patrono concessum , quam ut centesimum ultra lapidem in oram Campaniae libertum releget$$ What right ,  it was asked ,  was conceded to an injured patron but that of temporarily banishing the freedman a hundred miles off to the shores of Campania
 ceteras actiones promiscas et pares esse$$ In everything else ,  legal proceedings were equal and the same for both
 tribuendum aliquod telum , quod sperni nequeat$$ Some weapon ought to be given to the patrons which could not be despised
 nec grave manu missis per idem obsequium retinendi libertatem , per quod adsecuti sint$$ It would be no grievance for the enfranchised to have to keep their freedom by the same respectful behaviour which had procured it for them
 at criminum manifestos merito ad servitutem retrahi , ut metu coerceantur , quos beneficia non mutavissent$$ But ,  as for notorious offenders ,  they deserved to be dragged back into slavery ,  that fear might be a restraint where kindness had had no effect
 Disserebatur contra paucorum culpam ipsis exitiosam esse debere , nihil universorum iuri derogandum$$ It was argued in reply that ,  though the guilt of a few ought to be the ruin of the men themselves ,  there should be no diminution of the rights of the entire class
 quippe late fusum id corpus$$ For it was ,  they contended ,  a widely diffused body
 hinc plerumque tribus decurias , ministeria magistratibus et sacerdotibus , cohortes etiam in urbe conscriptas$$ from it ,  the city tribes ,  the various public functionaries ,  the establishments of the magistrates and priests were for the most part supplied ,  as well as the cohorts of the city-guard
 et plurimis equitum , plerisque senatoribus non aliunde originem trahi$$ very many too of the knights and several of the senators derived their origin from no other source
 si separarentur libertini , manifestam fore penuriam ingenuorum$$ If freedmen were to be a separate class ,  the paucity of the freeborn would be conspicuously apparent
 non frustra maiores , cum dignitatem ordinum dividerent , libertatem in communi posuisse$$ Not without good reason had our ancestors ,  in distinguishing the position of the different orders ,  thrown freedom open to all
 quin et manu mittendi duas species institutas , ut relinqueretur paenitentiae aut novo beneficio locus$$ Again ,  two kinds of enfranchisement had been instituted ,  so as to leave room for retracting the boon ,  or for a fresh act of grace
 quos vindicta patronus non liberaverit , velut vinclo servitutis attineri$$ Those whom the patron had not emancipated with the freedom-giving rod ,  were still held ,  as it were ,  by the bonds of slavery
 dispiceret quisque merita tardeque concederet , quod datum non adimeretur$$ Every master should carefully consider the merits of each case ,  and be slow to grant what once given could not be taken away
 haec sententia valuit , scripsitque Caesar senatui , privatim expenderent causam libertorum , quotiens a patronis arguerentur$$ This view prevailed ,  and the emperor replied to the Senate that ,  whenever freedmen were accused by their patrons ,  they were to investigate each case separately and not to annul any right to their common injury
 in commune nihil derogarent nec multo post ereptus amitae libertus Paris quasi iure civili , non sine infamia principis , cuius iussu perpetratum ingenuitatis iudicium erat$$ Soon afterwards ,  his aunt Domitia had her freedman Paris taken from her ,  avowedly by civil law ,  much to the emperor's disgrace ,  by whose direction a decision that he was freeborn was obtained
 Varie habita ac saepe mutata eius rei forma$$ The arrangement of this business had been variously and frequently altered
 nam Augustus senatui permisit deligere praefectos$$ Augustus allowed the Senate to appoint commissioners
 deinde ambitu suffragiorum suspecto , sorte ducebantur ex numero praetorum qui praeessent$$ then ,  when corrupt practices were suspected in the voting ,  men were chosen by lot for the office out of the whole number of praetors
 neque id diu mansit , quia sors deerrabat ad parum idoneos$$ This did not last long ,  as the lot strayed away to unfit persons
 tum Claudius quaestores rursum imposuit , iisque , ne metu offensionum segnius consulerent , extra ordinem honores promisit$$ Claudius then again appointed quaestors ,  and that they might not be too lax in their duties from fear of offending ,  he promised them promotion out of the usual course
 sed deerat robur aetatis eum primum magistratum capessentibus igitur Nero praetura perfunctos et experientia probatos delegit$$ But what they lacked was the firmness of mature age ,  entering ,  as they did ,  on this office as their first step ,  and so Nero appointed ex-praetors of approved competency

 at Lucius Volusius egregia fama concessit , cui tres et nonaginta anni spatium vivendi praecipuaeque opes bonis artibus , inoffensa tot imperatorum amicitia fuit$$ Lucius Volusius on the other hand died with a glorious name There was his long life of ninety-three years ,  his conspicuous wealth ,  honourably acquired ,  and his wise avoidance of the malignity of so many emperors
 Nerone iterum Lucius Pisone consulibus pauca memoria digna evenere , nisi cui libeat laudandis fundamentis et trabibus , quis molem amphitheatri apud campum Martis Caesar exstruxerat , volumina implere , cum ex dignitate populi Romani repertum sit res inlustres annalibus , talia diurnis urbis actis mandare$$ During Nero's second consulship with Lucius Piso for his colleague ,  little occurred deserving mention ,  unless one were to take pleasure in filling volumes with the praise of the foundations and timber work on which the emperor piled the immense amphitheatre in the Field of Mars But we have learnt that it suits the dignity of the Roman people to reserve history for great achievements ,  and to leave such details to the city's daily register

 Eius anni principio mollibus adhuc initiis prolatatum inter Parthos Romanosque de obtinenda Armenia bellum acriter sumitur , quia nec Vologaeses sinebat fratrem Tiridaten dati a se regni expertem esse aut alienae id potentiae donum habere , et Corbulo dignum magnitudine populi Romani rebatur parta olim a Lucullo Pompeioque recipere$$ Early in this year a war between Parthia and Rome about the possession of Armenia ,  which ,  feebly begun ,  had hitherto dragged on ,  was vigorously resumed For Vologeses would not allow his brother Tiridates to be deprived of a kingdom which he had himself given him ,  or to hold it as a gift from a foreign power ,  and Corbulo too thought it due to the grandeur of Rome that he should recover what Lucullus and Pompeius had formerly won
 ad hoc Armenii ambigua fide utraque arma invitabant , situ terrarum , similitudine morum Parthis propiores conubiisque permixti ac libertate ignota illuc magis ad servitium inclinantes$$ Besides ,  the Armenians in the fluctuations of their allegiance sought the armed protection of both empires ,  though by their country's position ,  by resemblance of manners ,  and by the ties of intermarriage ,  they were more connected with the Parthians ,  to whose subjection ,  in their ignorance of freedom ,  they rather inclined

 igitur Corbulo , quaesito diu proelio frustra habitus et exemplo hostium circumferre bellum coactus , dispertit vires , ut legati praefectique diversos locos pariter invaderent$$ So Corbulo ,  frustrated in his prolonged efforts to bring on an engagement and compelled ,  like the enemy ,  to carry hostilities everywhere ,  divided his army ,  so that his generals and officers might attack several points simultaneously
 simul regem Antiochum monet proximas sibi praefecturas petere nam Pharasmanes interfecto filio Radamisto quasi proditore , quo fidem in nos testaretur , vetus adversus Armenios odium promptius exercebat$$ He at the same time instructed king Antiochus to hasten to the provinces on his frontier ,  as Pharasmanes ,  after having slain his son Rhadamistus as a traitor to prove his loyalty to us ,  was following up more keenly than ever his old feud with the Armenians
 tuncque primum inlecti Moschi , gens ante alias socia Romanis , avia Armeniae incursavit$$ Then ,  for the first time ,  we won the friendship of the Moschi ,  a nation which became pre-eminently attached to Rome ,  and they overran the wilds of Armenia
 ita consilia Tiridati in contrarium vertebant , mittebatque oratores , qui suo Parthorumque nomine expostularent , cur datis nuper obsidibus redintegrataque amicitia quae novis quoque beneficiis locum aperiret , vetere Armeniae possessione depelleretur$$ Thus the intended plans of Tiridates were wholly reversed ,  and he sent envoys to ask on behalf of himself and of the Parthians ,  why ,  when hostages had lately been given and a friendship renewed which might open up a way to further acts of good will ,  he was thus driven from Armenia ,  his ancient possession
 ideo nondum ipsum Volgaesen commotum , quia causa quam vi agere mallent$$ As yet ,  he said ,  Vologeses had not bestirred himself ,  simply because they preferred negotiation to violence
 sin perstaretur in bello , non defore Arsacidis virtutem fortunamque saepius iam clade Romana expertam$$ Should however war be persisted in ,  the Arsacids would not want the courage and good fortune which had already been proved more than once by disaster to Rome
 ad ea Corbulo , satis comperto Volgaesen defectione Hyrcaniae attineri , suadet Tiridati precibus Caesarem adgredi posse illi regnum stabile et res incruentas contingere , si omissa spe longinqua et sera praesentem potioremque sequeretur$$ Corbulo in reply ,  when he was certain that Vologeses was detained by the revolt of Hyrcania ,  advised Tiridates to address a petition to the emperor ,  assuring him that he might reign securely and without bloodshed by relinquishing a prospect in the remote future for the sake of one more solid within his reach
 Placitum dehinc , qui commeantibus in vicem nuntiis nihil in summam pacis proficiebatur , colloquio ipsorum tempus locumque destinari$$ As no progress was made towards a final settlement of peace by the interchange of messages ,  it was at last decided to fix a time and a place for an interview between the leaders
 mille equitum praesidium Tiridates adfore sibi dicebat$$ A thousand troopers ,  Tiridates said ,  would be his escort

 cuicumque mortalium , nedum veteri et provido duci , barbarae astutiae patuissent ideo artum inde numerum finiri et hinc maiorem offerri , ut dolus pararetur$$ Any human being ,  to say nothing of an old and wary general ,  would have seen through the barbarian's cunning ,  which assigned a limited number on one side and offered a larger on the other ,  expressly with a treacherous intent
 nam equiti sagittarum usu exercito si detecta corpora obicerentur , nihil profuturam multitudinem$$ for ,  were they to be exposed to a cavalry trained in the use of arrows ,  with the person undefended ,  numbers would be unavailing
 dissimulato tamen intellectu rectius de iis , quae in publicum consulerentur , totis exercitibus coram dissertaturos respondit locumque delegit , cuius pars altera colles erant clementer adsurgentes accipiendis peditum ordinibus , pars in planitiem porrigebatur ad explicandas equitum turmas$$ Corbulo however ,  pretending not to understand this ,  replied that they would do better to discuss matters requiring consideration for their common good ,  in the presence of the entire armies ,  and he selected a place partly consisting of gently sloping hills ,  suited for ranks of infantry ,  partly ,  of a spreading plain where troops of cavalry could manoeuvre
 dieque pacto prior Corbulo socias cohortes et auxilia regum pro cornibus , medio sextam legionem constituit , cui accita per noctem aliis ex castris tria milia tertianorum permiscuerat , una cum aquila , quasi eadem legio spectaretur$$ On the appointed day ,  arriving first ,  he posted his allied infantry with the king's auxiliaries on the wings ,  the sixth legion in the centre ,  with which he had united three thousand men of the third ,  brought up in the night from another camp ,  with one eagle ,  so as to look like a single legion
 Tiridates vergente iam die procul adstitit , unde videri magis quam audiri posset$$ Tiridates towards evening showed himself at some distance whence he could be seen rather than heard
 ita sine congressu dux Romanus abscedere militem sua quemque in castra iubet$$ And so the Roman general ,  without any conference ,  ordered his troops to retire to their respective camps
 Rex sive fraudem suspectans , quia plura simul in loca ibatur , sive ut commeatus nostros Pontico mari et Trapezunte oppido adventantes interciperet , propere discedit$$ The king either suspecting a stratagem from these simultaneous movements in different directions ,  or intending to cut off our supplies as they were coming up from the sea of Pontus and the town of Trapezus ,  hastily withdrew
 sed neque commeatibus vim facere potuit , quia per montes ducebantur praesidiis nostris insessos , et Corbulo , ne inritum bellum traheretur utque Armenios ad sua defendenda cogeret , exscindere parat castella , sibique quod validissimum in ea praefectura , cognomento Volandum , sumit$$ He could not however make any attack on the supplies ,  as they were brought over mountains in the occupation of our forces Corbulo ,  that war might not be uselessly protracted ,  and also to compel the Armenians to defend their possessions ,  prepared to destroy their fortresses ,  himself undertaking the assault on the strongest of all in that province named Volandum
 minora Cornelio Flacco legato et Insteio Capitoni castrorum praefecto mandat$$ The weaker he assigned to Cornelius Flaccus ,  his lieutenant ,  and to Insteius Capito ,  his camp-prefect
 tum , circumspectis munimentis et quae expugnationi idonea provisis , hortatur milites , ut hostem vagum neque paci aut proelio paratum , sed perfidiam et ignaviam fuga confitentem exuerent sedibus gloriaeque pariter et praedae consulerent$$ Having then surveyed the defences and provided everything suitable for storming them ,  he exhorted his soldiers to strip of his home this vagabond foe who was preparing neither for peace nor for war ,  but who confessed his treachery and cowardice by flight ,  and so to secure alike glory and spoil
 tum quadripertito exercitu hos in testudinem conglobatos subruendo vallo inducit , alios scalas moenibus admovere , multos tormentis faces et hastas incutere iubet$$ Then forming his army into four divisions ,  he led one in the dense array of the testudo close up to the rampart ,  to undermine it ,  while others were ordered to apply scaling ladders to the walls ,  and many more were to discharge brands and javelins from engines
 libritoribus funditoribusque attributus locus , unde eminus glandes torquerent , ne qua pars subsidium laborantibus ferret pari undique metu$$ The slingers and artillerymen had a position assigned them from which to hurl their missiles at a distance ,  so that ,  with equal tumult everywhere ,  no support might be given from any point to such as were pressed
 tantus inde ardor certantis exercitus fuit , ut intra tertiam diei partem nudati propugnatoribus muri , obices portarum subversi , capta escensu munimenta omnesque puberes trucidati sint , nullo milite amisso , paucis admodum vulneratis$$ So impetuous were the efforts of the army that within a third part of one day the walls were stripped of their defenders ,  the barriers of the gates overthrown ,  the fortifications scaled and captured ,  and all the adult inhabitants massacred ,  without the loss of a soldier and with but very few wounded
 et imbelle vulgus sub corona venundatum , reliqua praeda victoribus cessit$$ The nonmilitary population were sold by auction
 pari fortuna legatus ac praefectus usi sunt , tribusque una die castellis expugnatis cetera terrore et alia sponte incolarum in deditionem veniebant$$ the rest of the booty fell to the conquerors Corbulo's lieutenant and camp-prefect met with similar success
 unde orta fiducia caput gentis Artaxata adgrediendi$$ three forts were stormed by them in one day ,  and the remainder ,  some from panic ,  others by the consent of the occupants ,  capitulated
 nec tamen proximo itinere ductae legiones , qua si amnem Araxen , qui moenia adluit , ponte transgrederentur , sub ictum dabantur$$ This inspired them with confidence to attack the capital of the country ,  Artaxata
 procul et latioribus vadis transiere$$ The legions however were not marched by the nearest route ,  for should they cross the river Avaxes which washes the city's walls by a bridge ,  they would be within missile-range
 Et Corbulo castra in loco metatus , an expeditis legionibus nocte Artaxata pergeret obsidioque circumdaret agitavit , concessisse illuc Tiridaten ratus$$ Corbulo then encamped on the spot ,  and considered whether he should push on his legions without their baggage to Artaxata and blockade the city ,  on which ,  he supposed ,  Tiridates had fallen back
 dein postquam exploratores attulere longinquum regis iter et Medi an Albani peterentur incertum , lucem opperitur , praemissaque levis armatura , quae muros interim ambiret oppugnationemque eminus inciperet$$ When his scouts reported that the king had undertaken a long march ,  and that it was doubtful whether Media or Albania was its destination ,  he waited for daylight ,  and then sent on his light-armed troops ,  which were meanwhile to hover round the walls and begin the attack from a distance
 sed oppidani portis sponte patefactis se suaque Romanis permisere$$ The inhabitants however opened the gates of their own accord ,  and surrendered themselves and their property to the Romans
 quod salutem ipsis tulit$$ This saved their lives
 Artaxatis ignis immissus deletaque et solo aequata sunt , qui nec teneri poterant sine valido praesidio ob magnitudinem moenium , nec id nobis virium erat , quod firmando praesidio et capessendo bello divideretur , vel , si integra et incustodita relinquerentur , nulla in eo utilitas aut gloria , quod capta essent$$ the city was fired ,  demolished and levelled to the ground ,  as it could not be held without a strong garrison from the extent of the walls ,  and we had not sufficient force to be divided between adequately garrisoning it and carrying on the war If again the place were left untouched and unguarded ,  no advantage or glory would accrue from its capture
 adicitur miraculum velut numine oblatum$$ Then too there was a wonderful occurrence ,  almost a divine interposition
 nam cuncta extra tectis hactenus sole inlustria fuere repente quod moenibus cingebatur ita atra nube coopertum fulgoribusque discretum est , ut quasi infensantibus deis exitio tradi crederetur$$ While the whole space outside the town ,  up to its buildings ,  was bright with sunlight ,  the enclosure within the walls was suddenly shrouded in a black cloud ,  seamed with lightning-flashes ,  and thus the city was thought to be given up to destruction ,  as if heaven was wroth against it
 Ob haec consalutatus imperator Nero , et senatus consulto supplicationes habitae , statuaeque et arcus et continui consulatus principi , utque inter festos referretur dies , quo patrata victoria , quo nuntiata , quo relatum de ea esset , aliaque in eandem formam decernuntur , adeo modum egressa , ut Gaius Cassius de ceteris honoribus adsensus , si pro benignitate fortunae dis grates agerentur , ne totum quidem annum supplicationibus sufficere disseruerit , eoque oportere dividi sacros et negotiosos dies , quis divina colerent et humana non impedirent$$ For all this Nero was unanimously saluted emperor ,  and by the Senate's decree a thanksgiving was held statues also ,  arches and successive consulships were voted to him ,  and among the holy days were to be included the day on which the victory was won ,  that on which it was announced ,  and that on which the motion was brought forward Other proposals too of a like kind were carried ,  on a scale so extravagant ,  that Caius Cassius ,  after having assented to the rest of the honours ,  argued that if the gods were to be thanked for the bountiful favours of fortune ,  even a whole year would not suffice for thanksgivings ,  and therefore there ought to be a classification of sacred and business-days ,  that so they might observe divine ordinances and yet not interfer with human affairs
 Variis deinde casibus iactatus et multorum odia meritus reus , haud tamen sine invidia Senecae damnatur$$ A man who had struggled with various calamities and earned the hate of many ,  was then impeached and condemned ,  but not without angry feelings towards Seneca
 is fuit Publius Suillius , imperitante Claudio terribilis ac venalis et mutatione temporum non quantum inimici cuperent demissus quique se nocentem videri quam supplicem mallet$$ This was Publius Suilius He had been terrible and venal ,  while Claudius reigned ,  and when times were changed ,  he was not so much humbled as his enemies wished ,  and was one who would rather seem a criminal than a suppliant
 eius opprimendi gratia repetitum credebatur senatus consultum poenaque Cinciae legis adversum eos , qui pretio causas oravissent$$ With the intent of crushing him ,  so men believed ,  a decree of the Senate was revived ,  along with the penalty of the Cincian law against persons who had pleaded for hire
 nec Suillius questu aut exprobratione abstinebat , praeter ferociam animi extrema senecta liber et Senecam increpans infensum amicis Claudii , sub quo iustissimum exilium pertulisset$$ Suilius spared not complaint or indignant remonstrance freespoken because of his extreme age as well as from his insolent temper ,  he taunted Seneca with his savage enmity against the friends of Claudius ,  under whose reign he had endured a most righteously deserved exile
 simul studiis inertibus et iuvenum imperitiae suetum livere iis , qui vividam et incorruptam eloquentiam tuendis civibus exercerent$$ The man ,  he said ,  familiar as he was only with profitless studies ,  and with the ignorance of boyhood ,  envied those who employed a lively and genuine eloquence in the defence of their fellow-citizens
 se quaestorem Germanici , illum domus eius adulterum fuisse$$ He had been Germanicus's quaestor ,  while Seneca had been a paramour in his house
 an gravius aestimandum sponte litigatoris praemium honestae operae adsequi quam corrumpere cubicula principum feminarum$$ Was it to be thought a worse offence to obtain a reward for honest service with the litigant's consent ,  than to pollute the chambers of the imperial ladies
 qua sapientia , quibus philosophorum praeceptis intra quadriennium regiae amicitiae ter milies sestertium paravisset$$ By what kind of wisdom or maxims of philosophy had Seneca within four years of royal favour amassed three hundred million sesterces
 Romae testamenta et orbos velut indagine eius capi , Italiam et provincias immenso faenore hauriri$$ At Rome the wills of the childless were ,  so to say ,  caught in his snare while Italy and the provinces were drained by a boundless usury
 at sibi labore quaesitam et modicam pecuniam esse$$ His own money ,  on the other hand ,  had been acquired by industry and was not excessive
 crimen , periculum , omnia potius toleraturum , quam veterem ac domi partam dignationem subitae felicitati submitteret$$ He would suffer prosecutions ,  perils ,  anything indeed rather than make an old and self-learned position of honour to bow before an upstart prosperity
 Nec deerant qui haec isdem verbis aut versa in deterius Senecae deferrent$$ Persons were not wanting to report all this to Seneca ,  in the exact words ,  or with a worse sense put on it
 repertique accusatores direptos socios , cum Suillius provinciam Asiam regeret , ac publicae pecuniae peculatum detulerunt$$ Accusers were also found who alleged that our allies had been plundered ,  when Suilius governed the province of Asia ,  and that there had been embezzlement of public monies
 mox , quia inquisitionem annuam impetraverant , brevius visum sub urbana crimina incipi , quorum obvii testes erant$$ Then ,  as an entire year had been granted to them for inquiries ,  it seemed a shorter plan to begin with his crimes at Rome ,  the witnesses of which were on the spot
 ii acerbitate accusationis Quintus Pomponium ad necessitatem belli civilis detrusum , Iuliam Drusi filiam Sabinamque Poppaeam ad mortem actas et Valerium Asiaticum , Lusium Saturninum , Cornelium Lupum circumventos , iam equitum Romanorum agmina damnata omnemque Claudii saevitiam Suillio obiectabant$$ These men charged Suilius with having driven Quintus Pomponius by a relentless prosecution into the extremity of civil war ,  with having forced Julia ,  Drusus's daughter ,  and Sabina Poppaea to suicide ,  with having treacherously ruined Valerius Asiaticus ,  Lusius Saturninus and Cornelius Lupus ,  in fact ,  with the wholesale conviction of troops of Roman knights ,  and with all the cruelty of Claudius
 ille nihil ex his sponte susceptum , sed principi paruisse defendebat , donec eam orationem Caesar cohibuit , compertum sibi referens ex commentariis patris sui nullam cuiusquam accusationem ab eo coactam$$ His defence was that of all this he had done nothing on his own responsibility but had simply obeyed the emperor ,  till Nero stopped such pleadings ,  by stating that he had ascertained from his father's notebooks that he had never compelled the prosecution of a single person
 tum iussa Messalinae praetendi et labare defensio$$ Suilius then sheltered himself under Messalina's orders ,  and the defence began to collapse
 cur enim neminem alium delectum , qui saevienti impudicae vocem praeberet$$ Why ,  it was asked ,  was no one else chosen to put his tongue at the service of that savage harlot
 puniendos rerum atrocium ministros , ubi pretia scelerum adepti scelera ipsa aliis delegent$$ We must punish the instruments of atrocious acts ,  when ,  having gained the rewards of wickedness ,  they impute the wickedness to others
 igitur adempta bonorum parte (nam filio et nepti pars concedebatur eximebanturque etiam quae testamento matris aut aviae acceperant) in insulas Baleares pellitur , non in ipso discrimine , non post damnationem fractus animo$$ And so ,  with the loss of half his property ,  his son and granddaughter being allowed to retain the other half ,  and what they had inherited under their mother's or grandmother's will being also exempted from confiscation ,  Suilius was banished to the Balearic isles
 ferebaturque copiosa et molli vita secretum illud toleravisse$$ Neither in the crisis of his peril nor after his condemnation did he quail in spirit
 filium eius Nerullinum adgressis accusatoribus per invidiam patris et crimina repetundarum , intercessit princeps tamquam satis expleta ultione$$ Rumour said that he supported that lonely exile by a life of ease and plenty When the accusers attacked his son Nerullinus on the strength of men's hatred of the father and of some charges of extortion ,  the emperor interposed ,  as if implying that vengeange was fully satisfied
 Per idem tempus Octavius Sagitta plebei tribunus , Pontiae mulieris nuptae amore vaecors , ingentibus donis adulterium et mox , ut omitteret maritum , emercatur , suum matrimonium promittens ac nuptias eius pactus$$ About the same time Octavius Sagitta ,  a tribune of the people ,  who was enamoured to frenzy of Pontia ,  a married woman ,  bribed her by most costly presents into an intrigue and then into abandoning her husband
 sed ubi mulier vacua fuit , nectere moras , adversam patris voluntatem causari repertaque spe ditioris coniugis promissa exuere$$ He had offered her marriage and had won her consent But as soon as she was free ,  she devised delays ,  pretended that her father's wishes were against it ,  and having secured the prospect of a richer husband ,  she repudiated her promises
 Octavius contra modo conqueri , modo minitari , famam perditam , pecuniam exhaustam obtestans , denique salutem , quae sola reliqua esset , arbitrio eius permittens$$ Octavius ,  on the other hand ,  now remonstrated ,  now threatened his good name ,  he protested ,  was lost ,  his means exhausted ,  and as for his life ,  which was all that was left to him ,  he surrendered it to her mercy
 ac postquam spernebatur , noctem unam ad solacium poscit , qua delenitus modum in posterum adhiberet$$ When she spurned him ,  he asked the solace of one night ,  with which to soothe his passion ,  that he might set bounds to it for the future

 ille uno cum liberto ferrum veste occultum infert$$ Octavius attended by one freedman entered with a dagger concealed under his dress
 tum , ut adsolet in amore et ira , iurgia preces , exprobratio satisfactio , et pars tenebrarum libidini seposita$$ Then ,  as usual in lovers' quarrels ,  there were chidings ,  entreaties ,  reproaches ,  excuses ,  and some period of the darkness was given up to passion
 ea quasi incensus nihil metuentem ferro transverberat et adcurrentem ancillam vulnere absterret cubiculoque prorumpit$$ then ,  when seemingly about to go ,  and she was fearing nothing ,  he stabbed her with the steel ,  and having wounded and scared away the slave girl who was hurrying to her ,  rushed out of the chamber
 postera die manifesta caedes , haud ambiguus percussor$$ Next day the murder was notorious ,  and there was no question as to the murderer ,  for it was proved that he had passed some time with her
 quippe mansitasse una convincebatur$$ The freedman ,  however ,  declared the deed was his ,  that he had ,  in fact ,  avenged his patron's wrongs
 sed libertus suum illud facinus profiteri , se patroni iniurias ultum esse$$ He had made some impression by the nobleness of his example ,  when the slave girl recovered and revealed the truth
 commoveratque quosdam magnitudine exempli , donec ancilla ex vulnere refecta verum aperuit$$ Octavius ,  when he ceased to be tribune ,  was prosecuted before the consuls by the father of the murdered woman ,  and was condemned by the sentence of the Senate under the law concerning assassins
 Non minus insignis eo anno impudicitia magnorum rei publicae malorum initium fecit$$ A profligacy equally notorious in that same year proved the beginning of great evils to the State
 erat in civitate Sabina Poppaea , Titus Ollio patre genita , sed nomen avi materni sumpserat , inlustri memoria Poppaei Sabini consularis et triumphali decore praefulgentis$$ There was at Rome one Sabina Poppaea her father was Titus Ollius ,  but she had assumed the name of her maternal grandfather Poppaeus Sabinus ,  a man of illustrious memory and pre-eminently distinguished by the honours of a consulship and a triumph
 nam Ollium honoribus nondum functum amicitia Seiani pervertit$$ As for Ollius ,  before he attained promotion ,  the friendship of Sejanus was his ruin
 huic mulieri cuncta alia fuere praeter honestum animum$$ This Poppaea had everything but a right mind
 quippe mater eius , aetatis suae feminas pulchritudine supergressa , gloriam pariter et formam dederat$$ Her mother ,  who surpassed in personal attractions all the ladies of her day ,  had bequeathed to her alike fame and beauty
 opes claritudine generis sufficiebant$$ Her fortune adequately corresponded to the nobility of her descent
 sermo comis nec absurdum ingenium$$ Her conversation was charming and her wit anything but dull

 famae numquam pepercit , maritos et adulteros non distinguens neque adfectui suo aut alieno obnoxia , unde utilitas ostenderetur , illuc libidinem transferebat$$ Her character she never spared ,  making no distinction between a husband and a paramour ,  while she was never a slave to her own passion or to that of her lover
 igitur agentem eam in matrimonio Rufri Crispini equitis Romani , ex quo filium genuerat , Otho pellexit iuventa ac luxu et quia flagrantissimus in amicitia Neronis habebatur nec mora quin adulterio matrimonium iungeretur$$ Wherever there was a prospect of advantage ,  there she transferred her favours And so while she was living as the wife of Rufius Crispinus ,  a Roman knight ,  by whom she had a son ,  she was attracted by the youth and fashionable elegance of Otho ,  and by the fact too that he was reputed to have Nero's most ardent friendship
 Otho sive amore incautus laudare formam elegantiamque uxoris apud principem , sive ut accenderet ac , si eadem femina potirentur , id quoque vinculum potentiam ei adiceret$$ Otho now began to praise his wife's beauty and accomplishments to the emperor ,  either from a lover's thoughtlessness or to inflame Nero's passion ,  in the hope of adding to his own influence by the further tie which would arise out of possession of the same woman
 saepe auditus est consurgens e convivio Caesaris seque ire ad illam , sibi concessam dictitans nobilitatem pulchritudinem , vota omnium et gaudia felicium$$ Often ,  as he rose from the emperor's table ,  was he heard repeatedly to say that he was going to her ,  to the high birth and beauty which had fallen to his lot ,  to that which all men pray for ,  the joy of the fortunate
 his atque talibus inritamentis non longa cunctatio interponitur , sed accepto aditu Poppaea primum per blandimenta et artes valescere , imparem cupidini et forma Neronis captam simulans$$ These and like incitements allowed but of brief delay Once having gained admission ,  Poppaea won her way by artful blandishments ,  pretending that she could not resist her passion and that she was captivated by Nero's person
 mox acri iam principis amore ad superbiam vertens , si ultra unam alteramque noctem attineretur , nuptam esse se dictitans , nec posse matrimonium omittere , devinctam Othoni per genus vitae , quod nemo adaequaret$$ Soon ,  as the emperor's love grew ardent ,  she would change and be supercilious ,  and ,  if she were detained more than one or two nights ,  would say again and again that she was a married woman and could not give up her husband attached as she was to Otho by a manner of life ,  which no one equalled
 illum animo et cultu magnificum$$ His ideas and his style were grand

 at Neronem , paelice ancilla et adsuetudine Actes devinctum , nihil e contubernio servili nisi abiectum et sordidum traxisse$$ Nero ,  on the contrary ,  with his slave girl mistress ,  tied down by his attachment to Acte ,  had derived nothing from his slavish associations but what was low and degrading
 deicitur familiaritate sueta , post congressu et comitatu Otho , et ad postremum , ne in urbe aemulatus ageret , provinciae Lusitaniae praeficitur$$ Otho was now cut off from Nero's usual familiar intercourse ,  and then even from interviews and from the royal suite ,  and at last was appointed governor of the province of Lusitania ,  that he might not be the emperor's rival at Rome
 ubi usque ad civilia arma non ex priore infamia , sed integre sancteque egit , procax otii et potestatis temperantior$$ There he lived up to the time of the civil wars ,  not in the fashion of his disgraceful past ,  but uprightly and virtuously ,  a pleasure-loving man when idle ,  and self-restrained when in power
 Isdem consulibus auditae Puteolanorum legationes , quas diversas ordo plebs ad senatum miserant , illi vim multitudinis , hi magistratuum et primi cuiusque avaritiam increpantes$$ During the same consulship a hearing was given to two conflicting deputations from Puteoli ,  sent to the Senate by the town council and by the populace The first spoke bitterly of the violence of the multitude the second ,  of the rapacity of the magistrates and of all the chief citizens

 quia severitatem eius non tolerabant , precante ipso ad Scribonios fratres ea cura transfertur , data cohorte praetoria , cuius terrore et paucorum supplicio rediit oppidanis concordia$$ As they would not endure his rigour ,  the charge of the affair was at his own request transferred to the brothers Scribonii ,  to whom was given a praetorian cohort ,  the terror of which ,  coupled with the execution of a few persons ,  restored peace to the townspeople
 Non referrem vulgarissimum senatus consultum , quo civitati Syracusanorum egredi numerum edendis gladiatoribus finitum permittebatur , nisi Paetus Thrasea contra dixisset praebuissetque materiem obtrectatoribus arguendae sententiae$$ I should not mention a very trivial decree of the Senate which allowed the city of Syracuse to exceed the prescribed number in their gladiatorial shows ,  had not Paetus Thrasea spoken against it and furnished his traducers with a ground for censuring his motion
 cur enim , si rem publicam egere libertate senatoria crederet , tam levia consectaretur$$ Why ,  it was asked ,  if he thought that the public welfare required freedom of speech in the Senate ,  did he pursue such trifling abuses
 quin de bello aut pace , de vectigalibus et legibus , quibusque aliis res Romana continetur , suaderet dissuaderetve$$ Why should he not speak for or against peace and war ,  or on the taxes and laws and other matters involving Roman interests
 licere patribus , quotiens ius dicendae sententiae accepissent , quae vellent expromere relationemque in ea postulare$$ The senators ,  as often as they received the privilege of stating an opinion ,  were at liberty to say out what they pleased ,  and to claim that it should be put to the vote
 an solum emendatione dignum , ne Syracusis spectacula largius ederentur$$ Was it the only worthy object of reform to provide that the Syracusans should not give shows on a larger scale
 cetera per omnes imperii partes perinde egregia quam si non Nero , sed Thrasea regimen eorum teneret$$ Were all other matters in every department of the empire as admirable as if Thrasea and not Nero had the direction of them
 quod si summa dissimulatione transmitterentur , quanto magis inanibus abstinendum! Thrasea contra , rationem poscentibus amicis , non praesentium ignarum respondebat eius modi consulta corrigere , sed patrum honori dare , ut manifestum fieret magnarum rerum curam non dissimulaturos , qui animum etiam levissimis adverterent$$ But if the highest affairs were passed by and ignored ,  how much more ought there to be no meddling with things wholly insignificant Thrasea in reply ,  when his friends asked an explanation ,  said that it was not in ignorance of Rome's actual condition that he sought to correct such decrees ,  but that he was giving what was due to the honour of the senators ,  in making it evident that those who attended even to the merest trifles ,  would not disguise their responsibility for important affairs
 Eodem anno crebris populi flagitationibus , immodestiam publicanorum arguentis , dubitavit Nero , an cuncta vectigalia omitti iuberet idque pulcherrimum donum generi mortalium daret$$ That same year ,  repeated demands on the part of the people ,  who denounced the excessive greed of the revenue collectors ,  made Nero doubt whether he should not order the repeal of all indirect taxes ,  and so confer a most splendid boon on the human race
 sed impetum eius , multum prius laudata magnitudine animi , attinuere seniores , dissolutionem imperii docendo , si fructus , quibus res publica sustineretur , deminuerentur$$ But this sudden impulse was checked by the senators ,  who ,  having first heartily praised the grandeur of his conception ,  pointed out that the dissolution of the empire must ensue if the revenues which supported the State were to be diminished
 quippe sublatis portoriis sequens , ut tributorum abolitio expostularetur$$ for as soon as the customs were swept away ,  there would follow a demand for the abolition of the direct taxes
 plerasque vectigalium societates a consulibus et tribunis plebis constitutas acri etiam tum populi Romani libertate reliqua mox ita provisa , ut ratio quaestuum et necessitas erogationum inter se congruerent$$ Many companies for the collection of the indirect taxes had been formed by consuls and tribunes ,  when the freedom of the Roman people was still in its vigour ,  and arrangements were subsequently made to insure an exact correspondence between the amount of income and the necessary disbursements
 temperandas plane publicanorum cupidines , ne per tot annos sine querela tolerata novis acerbitatibus ad invidiam verterent$$ Certainly some restraint ,  they admitted ,  must be put on the cupidity of the revenue collectors ,  that they might not by new oppressions bring into odium what for so many years had been endured without a complaint
 Ergo edixit princeps , ut leges cuiusque publici , occultae ad id tempus , proscriberentur$$ Accordingly the emperor issued an edict that the regulations about every branch of the public revenue ,  which had hitherto been kept secret ,  should be published
 omissas petitiones non ultra annum resumerent$$ that claims which had been dropped should not be revived after a year
 Romae praetor , per provincias qui pro praetore aut consule essent iura adversus publicanos extra ordinem redderent$$ that the praetor at Rome ,  the propraetor or proconsul in the provinces ,  should give judicial precedence to all cases against the collectors
 militibus immunitas servaretur , nisi in iis , quae veno exercerent aliaque admodum aequa , quae brevi servata , dein frustra habita sunt$$ that the soldiers should retain their immunities except when they traded for profit ,  with other very equitable arrangements ,  which for a short time were maintained and were subsequently disregarded
 manet tamen abolitio quadragesimae quinquagesimaeque et quae alia exactionibus inlicitis nomina publicani invenerant$$ However ,  the repeal of the two per cent and two-and-a-half per cent taxes remains in force ,  as well as that of others bearing names invented by the collectors to cover their illegal exactions
 temperata apud transmarinas provincias frumenti subvectio , et , ne censibus negotiatorum naves adscriberentur tributumque pro illis penderent , constitutum$$ In our transmarine provinces the conveyance of corn was rendered less costly ,  and it was decided that merchant ships should not be assessed with their owner's property ,  and that no tax should be paid on them
 Quietae ad id tempus res in Germania fuerant , ingenio ducum , qui pervulgatis triumphi insignibus maius ex eo decus sperabant , si pacem continuavissent$$ Up to this time everything had been quiet in Germany ,  from the temper of the generals ,  who ,  now that triumphal decorations had been vulgarised ,  hoped for greater glory by the maintenance of peace
 Paulinus Pompeius et Lucius Vetus ea tempestate exercitui praeerant$$ Paulinus Pompeius and Lucius Vetus were then in command of the army
 ne tamen segnem militem attinerent , ille inchoatum ante tres et sexaginta annos a Druso aggerem coercendo Rheno absolvit , Vetus Mosellam atque Ararim facta inter utrumque fossa conectere parabat , ut copiae per mare , dein Rhodano et Arare subvectae per eam fossam , mox fluvio Mosella in Rhenum , exim Oceanum decurrerent , sublatisque itineris difficultatibus navigabilia inter se Occidentis Septentrionisque litora fierent$$ Still ,  to avoid keeping the soldiers in idleness ,  the first completed the embankment begun sixty-three years before by Drusus to confine the waters of the Rhine ,  while Vetus prepared to connect the Moselle and the Arar by a canal ,  so that troops crossing the sea and then conveyed on the Rhone and Arar might sail by this canal into the Moselle and the Rhine ,  and thence to the ocean Thus the difficulties of the route being removed ,  there would be communication for ships between the shores of the west and of the north
 invidit operi Aelius Gracilis Belgicae legatus , deterrendo Veterem , ne legiones alienae provinciae inferret studiaque Galliarum adfectaret , formidolosum id imperatori dictitans , quo plerumque prohibentur conatus honesti$$ Aelius Gracilis ,  the governor of Belgica ,  discouraged the work by seeking to deter Vetus from bringing his legions into another man's province ,  and so drawing to himself the attachment of Gaul This result he repeatedly said would excite the fears of the emperor ,  an assertion by which meritorious undertakings are often hindered
 Ceterum continuo exercituum otio fama incessit ereptum ius legatis ducendi in hostem$$ Meantime ,  from the continued inaction of our armies ,  a rumour prevailed that the commanders had been deprived of the right of leading them against the enemy
 eoque Frisii iuventutem saltibus aut paludibus , imbellem aetatem per lacus admovere ripae agrosque vacuos et militum usui sepositos insedere , auctore Verrito et Malorige , qui nationem eam regebant , in quantum Germani regnantur$$ Thereupon the Frisii moved up their youth to the forests and swamps ,  and their non-fighting population ,  over the lakes ,  to the river-bank ,  and established themselves in unoccupied lands ,  reserved for the use of our soldiers ,  under the leadership of Verritus and Malorix ,  the kings of the tribe ,  as far as Germans are under kings
 iamque fixerant domos , semina arvis intulerant utque patrium solum exercebant , cum Dubius Avitus , accepta a Paulino provincia , minitando vim Romanam , nisi abscederent Frisii veteres in locos aut novam sedem a Caesare impetrarent , perpulit Verritum et Malorigem preces suscipere$$ Already they had settled themselves in houses ,  had sown the fields ,  and were cultivating the soil as if it had been their ancestors' ,  when Dubius Avitus ,  who had succeeded Paulinus in the province ,  by threatening them with a Roman attack if they did not retire into their old country or obtain a new territory from the emperor ,  constrained Verritus and Malorix to become suppliants
 profectique Romam , dum aliis curis intentum Neronem opperiuntur , inter ea , quae barbaris ostentantur , intravere Pompei theatrum , quo magnitudinem populi viserent$$ They went to Rome ,  and while they waited for Nero ,  who was intent on other engagements ,  among the sights shown to the barbarians they were admitted into Pompey's theatre ,  where they might behold the vastness of the Roman people
 illic per otium (neque enim ludicris ignari oblectabantur) dum consessum caveae , discrimina ordinum , quis eques , ubi senatus , percunctantur , advertere quosdam cultu externo in sedibus senatorum$$ There at their leisure (for in the entertainment ,  ignorant as they were ,  they found no amusement) they asked questions about the crowd on the benches ,  about the distinctions of classes ,  who were the knights ,  where was the Senate ,  till they observed some persons in a foreign dress on the seats of the senators
 et quinam forent rogitantes , postquam audiverant earum gentium legatis id honoris datum , quae virtute et amicitia Romana praecellerent , nullos mortalium armis aut fide ante Germanos esse exclamant degrediunturque et inter patres considunt$$ Having asked who they were ,  when they were told that this honour was granted to envoys from those nations which were distinguished for their bravery and their friendship to Rome ,  they exclaimed that no men on earth surpassed the Germans in arms or in loyalty
 quod comiter a visentibus exceptum , quasi impetus antiqui et bona aemulatione$$ Then they went down and took their seat among the senators
 Nero civitate Romana ambos donavit , Frisios decedere agris iussit$$ The spectators hailed the act goodnaturedly ,  as due to the impulsiveness of a primitive people and to an honourable rivalry
 atque illis aspernantibus auxiliaris eques repente immissus necessitatem attulit , captis caesisve qui pervicacius restiterant$$ Nero gave both of them the Roman franchise ,  and ordered the Frisii to withdraw from the territory in question
 Eosdem agros Ampsivarii occupavere , validior gens non modo sua copia , sed adiacentium populorum miseratione , qui pulsi a Chaucis et sedis inopes tutum exilium orabant$$ Of this same territory ,  the Ampsivarii now possessed themselves ,  a tribe more powerful not only from their numbers ,  but from having the sympathy of the neighbouring peoples ,  as they had been expelled by the Chauci and had to beg ,  as homeless outcasts ,  a secure exile
 aderatque iis clarus per illas gentes et nobis quoque fidus nomine Boiocalus , vinctum se rebellione Cherusca iussu Arminii referens , mox Tiberio et Germanico ducibus stipendia meruisse , et quinquaginta annorum obsequio id quoque adiungere , quod gentem suam dicioni nostrae subiceret$$ Their cause was pleaded by a man ,  famous among those nations and loyal to Rome ,  Boiocalus by name ,  who reminded us that on the Cheruscan revolt he had been imprisoned by the order of Arminius ,  that afterwards he had served under the leadership of Tiberius and of Germanicus ,  and that to a fifty years' obedience he was adding the merit of subjecting his tribe to our dominion
 quotam partem campi iacere , in quam pecora et armenta militum aliquando transmitterentur! servarent sane receptus gregibus inter hominum famem , modo ne vastitatem et solitudinem mallent quam amicos populos$$ What an extent of plain ,  he would say ,  lies open into which the flocks and herds of the Roman soldiers may some day be sent! Let them by all means keep retreats for their cattle ,  while men are starving only let them not prefer a waste and a solitude to friendly nations
 Chamavorum quondam ea arva , mox Tubantum et post Usiporum fuisse$$ Once these fields belonged to the Chamavi
 sicuti caelum deis , ita terras generi mortalium datas$$ then to the Tubantes
 quaeque vacuae , eas publicas esse$$ after them to the Usipii
 solum inde suspiciens et cetera sidera vocans quasi coram interrogabat , vellentne contueri inane solum$$ As heaven is for the gods ,  so the earth has been given to mankind ,  and lands uninhabited are common to all
 potius mare superfunderent adversus terrarum ereptores$$ Then looking up to the sun and invoking the other heavenly bodies ,  he asked them ,  as though standing in their presence ,  whether they wished to behold an empty soil
 Et commotus his Avitus$$ Avitus was impressed by this language and said that people must submit to the rule of their betters
 patienda meliorum imperia id dis , quos implorarent , placitum , ut arbitrium penes Romanos maneret , quid darent quid adimerent , neque alios iudices quam se ipsos paterentur$$ that the gods to whom they appealed ,  had willed that the decision as to what should be given or taken from them ,  was to rest with the Romans ,  who would allow none but themselves to be judges
 haec an in publicum Ampsivariis respondit , ipsi Boiocalo ob memoriam amicitiae daturum agros$$ This was his public answer to the Ampsivarii to Boiocalus his reply was that in remembrance of past friendship he would cede the lands in question
 quod ille ut proditionis pretium aspernatus addidit deesse nobis terra ubi vivamus , in qua moriamur , non potest$$ Boiocalus spurned the offer as the price of treason ,  adding ,  We may lack a land to live in
 atque ita infensis utrimque animis discessum$$ we cannot lack one to die in
 illi Bructeros , Tencteros , ulteriores etiam nationes socias bello vocabant$$ And so they parted with mutual exasperation
 Avitus scripto ad Curtilium Manciam superioris exercitum legatum , ut Rhenum transgressus arma a tergo ostenderet , ipse legiones in agrum Tencterum induxit , excidium minitans , ni causam suam dissociarent igitur absistentibus his pari metu exterriti Bructeri$$ The Ampsivarii now called on the Bructeri ,  the Tencteri ,  and yet more distant tribes to be their allies in war Avitus ,  having written to Curtilius Mancia ,  commander of the Upper army ,  asking him to cross the Rhine and display his troops in the enemy's rear ,  himself led his legions into the territory of the Tencteri ,  and threatened them with extermination unless they dissociated themselves from the cause
 et ceteris quoque aliena pericula deserentibus sola Ampsivariorum gens retro ad Usipos et Tubantes concessit$$ When upon this the Tencteri stood aloof ,  the Bructeri were cowed by a like terror
 quorum terris exacti cum Chattos , dein Cheruscos petissent , errore longo hospites , egeni , hostes in alieno quod iuventutis erat caeduntur , imbellis aetas in praedam divisa est$$ And so ,  as the rest too were for averting perils which did not concern them ,  the Ampsivarian tribe in its isolation retreated to the Usipii and Tubantes Driven out of these countries ,  they sought refuge with the Chatti and then with the Cherusci ,  and after long wanderings ,  as destitute outcasts ,  received now as friends now as foes ,  their entire youth were slain in a strange land ,  and all who could not fight ,  were apportioned as booty
 Eadem aestate inter Hermunduros Chattosque certatum magno proelio , dum flumen gignendo sale fecundum et conterminum vi trahunt , super libidinem cuncta armis agendi religione insita , eos maxime locos propinquare caelo precesque mortalium a deis nusquam propius audiri$$ The same summer a great battle was fought between the Hermunduri and the Chatti ,  both forcibly claiming a river which produced salt in plenty ,  and bounded their territories They had not only a passion for settling every question by arms ,  but also a deep-rooted superstition that such localities are specially near to heaven ,  and that mortal prayers are nowhere more attentively heard by the gods
 inde indulgentia numinum illo in amne illisque silvis salem provenire , non ut alias apud gentes eluvie maris arescente , sed unda super ardentem arborum struem fusa ex contrariis inter se elementis , igne atque aquis , concretum$$ It is ,  they think ,  through the bounty of divine power ,  that in that river and in those forests salt is produced ,  not ,  as in other countries ,  by the drying up of an overflow of the sea ,  but by the combination of two opposite elements ,  fire and water ,  when the latter had been poured over a burning pile of wood
 sed bellum hermunduris prosperum , Chattis exitiosius fuit , quia victores diversam aciem marti ac Mercurio sacravere , quo voto equi viri , cuncta viva occidioni dantur$$ The war was a success for the Hermunduri ,  and the more disastrous to the Chatti because they had devoted ,  in the event of victory ,  the enemy's army to Mars and Mercury ,  a vow which consigns horses ,  men ,  everything indeed on the vanquished side to destruction
 et minae quidem hostiles in ipsos vertebant$$ And so the hostile threat recoiled on themselves
 sed civitas Ubiorum socia nobis malo improviso adflicta est$$ Meanwhile ,  a state in alliance with us ,  that of the Ubii ,  suffered grievously from an unexpected calamity
 nam ignes terra editi villas arva vicos passim corripiebant ferebanturque in ipsa conditae nuper coloniae moenia$$ Fires suddenly bursting from the earth seized everywhere on country houses ,  crops ,  and villages ,  and were rushing on to the very walls of the newly founded colony
 neque exstingui poterant , non si imbres caderent , non si fluvialibus aquis aut quo alio humore , donec inopia remedii et ira cladis agrestes quidam eminus saxa iacere , dein residentibus flammis propius suggressi ictu fustium aliisque verberibus ut feras absterrebant$$ Nor could they be extinguished by the fall of rain ,  or by river-water ,  or by any other moisture ,  till some countrymen ,  in despair of a remedy and in fury at the disaster ,  flung stones from a distance ,  and then ,  approaching nearer ,  as the flames began to sink ,  tried to scare them away ,  like so many wild beasts ,  with the blows of clubs and other weapons
 postremo tegmina corpori derepta iniciunt , quanto magis profana et usu polluta , tanto magis oppressura ignes$$ At last they stript off their clothes and threw them on the fire ,  which they were the more likely to quench ,  the more they had been soiled by common use
 Gaio Vipstano Gaius Fonteio consulibus diu meditatum scelus non ultra Nero distulit , vetustate imperii coalita audacia et flagrantior in dies amore Poppaeae , quae sibi matrimonium et discidium Octaviae incolumi Agrippina haud sperans crebris criminationibus , aliquando per facetias incusare principem et pupillum vocare , qui iussis alienis obnoxius non modo imperii , sed libertatis etiam indigeret$$ In the year of the consulship of Caius Vipstanus and Caius Fonteius ,  Nero deferred no more a long meditated crime Length of power had matured his daring ,  and his passion for Poppaea daily grew more ardent As the woman had no hope of marriage for herself or of Octavia's divorce while Agrippina lived ,  she would reproach the emperor with incessant vituperation and sometimes call him in jest a mere ward who was under the rule of others ,  and was so far from having empire that he had not even his liberty
 cur enim differri nuptias suas$$ Why ,  she asked ,  was her marriage put off
 formam scilicet displicere et triumphales avos , an fecunditatem et verum animum$$ Was it ,  forsooth ,  her beauty and her ancestors ,  with their triumphal honours ,  that failed to please ,  or her being a mother ,  and her sincere heart
 timeri ne uxor saltem iniurias patrum , iram populi adversus superbiam avaritiamque matris aperiat$$ No the fear was that as a wife at least she would divulge the wrongs of the Senate ,  and the wrath of the people at the arrogance and rapacity of his mother
 quod si nurum Agrippina non nisi filio infestam ferre posset , redderetur ipsa Othonis coniugio$$ If the only daughter-in-law Agrippina could bear was one who wished evil to her son ,  let her be restored to her union with Otho
 ituram quoque terrarum , ubi audiret potius contumelias imperatoris quam viseret periculis eius immixta$$ She would go anywhere in the world ,  where she might hear of the insults heaped on the emperor ,  rather than witness them ,  and be also involved in his perils
 haec atque talia lacrimis et arte adulterae penetrantia nemo prohibebat , cupientibus cunctis infringi potentiam matris et credente nullo usque ad caedem eius duratura filii odia$$ These and the like complaints ,  rendered impressive by tears and by the cunning of an adulteress ,  no one checked ,  as all longed to see the mother's power broken ,  while not a person believed that the son's hatred would steel his heart to her murder
 Tradit Cluvius ardore retinendae Agrippinam potentiae eo usque provectam , ut medio diei , cum id temporis Nero per vinum et epulas incalesceret , offerret se saepius temulento comptam in incesto paratam iamque lasciva oscula et praenuntias flagitii blanditias adnotantibus proximis , Senecam contra muliebris inlecebras subsidium a femina petivisse , immissamque Acten libertam , quae simul suo periculo et infamia Neronis anxia deferret pervulgatum esse incestum gloriante matre , nec toleraturos milites profani principis imperium$$ Cluvius relates that Agrippina in her eagerness to retain her influence went so far that more than once at midday ,  when Nero ,  even at that hour ,  was flushed with wine and feasting ,  she presented herself attractively attired to her half intoxicated son and offered him her person ,  and that when kinsfolk observed wanton kisses and caresses ,  portending infamy ,  it was Seneca who sought a female's aid against a woman's fascinations ,  and hurried in Acte ,  the freed-girl ,  who alarmed at her own peril and at Nero's disgrace ,  told him that the incest was notorious ,  as his mother boasted of it ,  and that the soldiers would never endure the rule of an impious sovereign
 Fabius Rusticus non Agrippinae sed Neroni cupitum id memorat eiusdemque libertae astu disiectum$$ Fabius Rusticus tells us that it was not Agrippina ,  but Nero ,  who lusted for the crime ,  and that it was frustrated by the adroitness of that same freed-girl
 sed quae Cluvius , eadem ceteri quoque auctores prodidere , et fama huc inclinat , seu concepit animo tantum immanitatis Agrippina , seu credibilior novae libidinis meditatio in ea visa est , quae puellaribus annis stuprum cum Marcus Lepido spe dominationis admiserat , pari cupidine usque ad libita Pallantis provoluta et exercita ad omne flagitium patrui nuptiis$$ Cluvius's account ,  however ,  is also that of all other authors ,  and popular belief inclines to it ,  whether it was that Agrippina really conceived such a monstrous wickedness in her heart ,  or perhaps because the thought of a strange passion seemed comparatively credible in a woman ,  who in her girlish years had allowed herself to be seduced by Lepidus in the hope of winning power ,  had stooped with a like ambition to the lust of Pallas ,  and had trained herself for every infamy by her marriage with her uncle
 Igitur Nero vitare secretos eius congressus , abscedentem in hortos aut Tusculanum vel Antiatem in agrum laudare , quod otium capesseret$$ Nero accordingly avoided secret interviews with her ,  and when she withdrew to her gardens or to her estates at Tusculum and Antium ,  he praised her for courting repose
 postremo , ubicumque haberetur , praegravem ratus interficere constituit , hactenus consultans , veneno an ferro vel qua alia vi$$ At last ,  convinced that she would be too formidable ,  wherever she might dwell ,  he resolved to destroy her ,  merely deliberating whether it was to be accomplished by poison ,  or by the sword ,  or by any other violent means
 placuitque primo venenum sed inter epulas principis si daretur , referri ad casum non poterat tali iam Britannici exitio$$ Poison at first seemed best ,  but ,  were it to be administered at the imperial table ,  the result could not be referred to chance after the recent circumstances of the death of Britannicus
 et ministros temptare arduum videbatur mulieris usu scelerum adversus insidias intentae atque ipsa praesumendo remedia munierat corpus$$ Again ,  to tamper with the servants of a woman who ,  from her familiarity with crime ,  was on her guard against treachery ,  appeared to be extremely difficult ,  and then ,  too ,  she had fortified her constitution by the use of antidotes
 ferrum et caedes quonam modo occultaretur , nemo reperiebat et ne quis illi tanto facinori delectus iussa sperneret metuebat$$ How again the dagger and its work were to be kept secret ,  no one could suggest ,  and it was feared too that whoever might be chosen to execute such a crime would spurn the order
 obtulit ingenium Anicetus libertus , classi apud Misenum praefectus et pueritiae Neronis educator ac mutuis odiis Agrippinae invisus$$ An ingenious suggestion was offered by Anicetus ,  a freedman ,  commander of the fleet at Misenum ,  who had been tutor to Nero in boyhood and had a hatred of Agrippina which she reciprocated
 ergo navem posse componi docet , cuius pars ipso in mari per artem soluta effunderet ignaram$$ He explained that a vessel could be constructed ,  from which a part might by a contrivance be detached ,  when out at sea ,  so as to plunge her unawares into the water
 nihil tam capax fortuitorum quam mare et si naufragio intercepta sit , quem adeo iniquum , ut sceleri adsignet , quod venti et fluctus deliquerint$$ Nothing ,  he said ,  allowed of accidents so much as the sea ,  and should she be overtaken by shipwreck ,  who would be so unfair as to impute to crime an offence committed by the winds and waves
 additurum principem defunctae templum et aras et cetera ostentandae pietati$$ The emperor would add the honour of a temple and of shrines to the deceased lady ,  with every other display of filial affection
 Noctem sideribus inlustrem et placido mari quietam quasi convincendum ad scelus dii praebuere$$ A night of brilliant starlight with the calm of a tranquil sea was granted by heaven ,  seemingly ,  to convict the crime
 nec multum erat progressa navis , duobus e numero familiarium Agrippinam comitantibus , ex quis Crepereius Gallus haud procul gubernaculis adstabat , Acerronia super pedes cubitantis reclinis paenitentiam filii et recuperatam matris gratiam per gaudium memorabat , cum dato signo ruere tectum loci multo plumbo grave , pressusque Crepereius et statim exanimatus est$$ The vessel had not gone far ,  Agrippina having with her two of her intimate attendants ,  one of whom ,  Crepereius Gallus ,  stood near the helm ,  while Acerronia ,  reclining at Agrippina's feet as she reposed herself ,  spoke joyfully of her son's repentance and of the recovery of the mother's influence ,  when at a given signal the ceiling of the place ,  which was loaded with a quantity of lead ,  fell in ,  and Crepereius was crushed and instantly killed
 Agrippina et Acerronia eminentibus lecti parietibus ac forte validioribus , quam ut oneri cederent , protectae sunt$$ Agrippina and Acerronia were protected by the projecting sides of the couch ,  which happened to be too strong to yield under the weight
 nec dissolutio navigii sequebatur , turbatis omnibus et quod plerique ignari etiam conscios impediebant$$ But this was not followed by the breaking up of the vessel
 visum dehinc remigibus unum in latus inclinare atque ita navem submergere$$ for all were bewildered ,  and those too ,  who were in the plot ,  were hindered by the unconscious majority
 sed neque ipsis promptus in rem subitam consensus , et alii contra nitentes dedere facultatem lenioris in mare iactus verum Acerronia , imprudentia dum se Agrippinam esse utque subveniretur matri principis clamitat , contis et remis et quae fors obtulerat navalibus telis conficitur Agrippina silens eoque minus agnita (unum tamen vulnus umero excepit) nando , deinde occursu lenunculorum Lucrinum in lacum vecta villae suae infertur$$ The crew then thought it best to throw the vessel on one side and so sink it ,  but they could not themselves promptly unite to face the emergency ,  and others ,  by counteracting the attempt ,  gave an opportunity of a gentler fall into the sea Acerronia ,  however ,  thoughtlessly exclaiming that she was Agrippina ,  and imploring help for the emperor's mother ,  was despatched with poles and oars ,  and such naval implements as chance offered Agrippina was silent and was thus the less recognized
 Illic reputans ideo se fallacibus litteris accitam et honore praecipuo habitam , quodque litus iuxta , non ventis acta , non saxis impulsa navis summa sui parte veluti terrestre machinamentum concidisset , observans etiam Acerroniae necem , simul suum vulnus adspiciens , solum insidiarum remedium esse sensit , si non intellegerentur$$ There she reflected how for this very purpose she had been invited by a lying letter and treated with conspicuous honour ,  how also it was near the shore ,  not from being driven by winds or dashed on rocks ,  that the vessel had in its upper part collapsed ,  like a mechanism anything but nautical She pondered too the death of Acerronia she looked at her own wound ,  and saw that her only safeguard against treachery was to ignore it
 misitque libertum Agermum , qui nuntiaret filio benignitate deum et fortuna eius evasisse gravem casum$$ Then she sent her freedman Agerinus to tell her son how by heaven's favour and his good fortune she had escaped a terrible disaster
 orare ut quamvis periculo matris exterritus visendi curam differret sibi ad praesens quiete opus$$ that she begged him ,  alarmed ,  as he might be ,  by his mother's peril ,  to put off the duty of a visit ,  as for the present she needed repose
 atque interim securitate simulata medicamina vulneri et fomenta corpori adhibet$$ Meanwhile ,  pretending that she felt secure ,  she applied remedies to her wound ,  and fomentations to her person
 testamentum Acerroniae requiri bonaque obsignari iubet , id tantum non per simulationem$$ She then ordered search to be made for the will of Acerronia ,  and her property to be sealed ,  in this alone throwing off disguise
 Interim vulgato Agrippinae periculo , quasi casu evenisset , ut quisque acceperat , decurrere ad litus$$ Meantime ,  Agrippina's peril being universally known and taken to be an accidental occurrence ,  everybody ,  the moment he heard of it ,  hurried down to the beach
 hi molium obiectus , hi proximas scaphas scandere$$ Some climbed projecting piers
 alii , quantum corpus sinebat , vadere in mare$$ some the nearest vessels
 quidam manus protendere$$ others ,  as far as their stature allowed ,  went into the sea
 questibus votis clamore diversa rogitantium aut incerta respondentium omnis ora compleri$$ some ,  again ,  stood with outstretched arms ,  while the whole shore rung with wailings ,  with prayers and cries ,  as different questions were asked and uncertain answers given
 adfluere ingens multitudo cum luminibus , atque ubi incolumem esse pernotuit , ut ad gratandum sese expedire , donec adspectu armati et minitantis agminis deiecti sunt$$ A vast multitude streamed to the spot with torches ,  and as soon as all knew that she was safe ,  they at once prepared to wish her joy ,  till the sight of an armed and threatening force scared them away
 Anicetus villam statione circumdat refractaque ianua obvios servorum abripit , donec ad fores cubiculi veniret$$ Anicetus then surrounded the house with a guard ,  and having burst open the gates ,  dragged off the slaves who met him ,  till he came to the door of her chamber ,  where a few still stood ,  after the rest had fled in terror at the attack
 cui pauci adstabant , ceteris terrore inrumpentium exterritis cubiculo modicum lumen inerat et ancillarum una , magis ac magis anxia Agrippina , quod nemo a filio ac ne Agermus quidem$$ A small lamp was in the room ,  and one slave-girl with Agrippina ,  who grew more and more anxious ,  as no messenger came from her son ,  not even Agerinus ,  while the appearance of the shore was changed ,  a solitude one moment ,  then sudden bustle and tokens of the worst catastrophe
 aliam fore laetae rei faciem$$ As the girl rose to depart ,  she exclaimed ,  Do you too forsake me
 nunc solitudinem ac repentinos strepitus et extremi mali indicia$$ and looking round saw Anicetus ,  who had with him the captain of the trireme ,  Herculeius ,  and Obaritus ,  a centurion of marines
 abeunte dehinc ancilla , tu quoque me deseris$$ If ,  said she ,  you have come to see me ,  take back word that I have recovered ,  but if you are here to do a crime ,  I believe nothing about my son
 prolocuta respicit Anicetum , trierarcho Herculeio et Obarito centurione classiario comitatum$$ he has not ordered his mother's murder
 ac si ad visendum venisset , refotam nuntiaret , sin facinus patraturus , nihil se de filio credere$$ The assassins closed in round her couch ,  and the captain of the trireme first struck her head violently with a club
 non imperatum parricidium circumsistunt lectum percussores et prior trierarchus fusti caput eius adflixit$$ Then ,  as the centurion bared his sword for the fatal deed ,  presenting her person ,  she exclaimed ,  Smite my womb ,  and with many wounds she was slain
 Miro tamen certamine procerum decernuntur supplicationes apud omnia pulvinaria , utque Quinquatrus , quibus apertae insidiae essent , ludis annuis celebrarentur , aureum Minervae simulacrum in curia et iuxta principis imago statuerentur , dies natalis Agrippinae inter nefastos esset$$ Still there was a marvellous rivalry among the nobles in decreeing thanksgivings at all the shrines ,  and the celebration with annual games of Minerva's festival ,  as the day on which the plot had been discovered also ,  that a golden image of Minerva with a statue of the emperor by its side should be set up in the Senate-house ,  and that Agrippina's birthday should be classed among the inauspicious days
 Thrasea Paetus silentio vel brevi adsensu priores adulationes transmittere solitus exii tum senatu , ac sibi causam periculi fecit , ceteris libertatis initium non praebuit$$ Thrasea Paetus ,  who had been used to pass over previous flatteries in silence or with brief assent ,  then walked out of the Senate ,  thereby imperilling himself ,  without communicating to the other senators any impulse towards freedom
 prodigia quoque crebra et inrita intercessere$$ There occurred too a thick succession of portents ,  which meant nothing
 anguem enixa mulier , et alia in concubitu mariti fulmine exanimata$$ A woman gave birth to a snake ,  and another was killed by a thunderbolt in her husband's embrace
 iam sol repente obscuratus et tactae de caelo quattuordecim urbis regiones$$ Then the sun was suddenly darkened and the fourteen districts of the city were struck by lightning
 quae adeo sine cura deum eveniebant , ut multos postea annos Nero imperium et scelera continuaverit$$ All this happened quite without any providential design
 ceterum quo gravaret invidiam matris eaque demota auctam lenitatem suam testificaretur , feminas inlustres Iuniam et Calpurniam , praetura functos Valerium Capitonem et Licinium Gabolum sedibus patriis reddidit , ab Agrippina olim pulsos$$ so much so ,  that for many subsequent years Nero prolonged his reign and his crimes Still ,  to deepen the popular hatred towards his mother ,  and prove that since her removal ,  his clemency had increased ,  he restored to their ancestral homes two distinguished ladies ,  Junia and Calpurnia ,  with two ex-praetors ,  Valerius Capito and Licinius Gabolus ,  whom Agrippina had formerly banished

 quosque ipse nuper relegaverat Iturium et Calvisium poena exsolvit$$ Iturius and Calvisius ,  whom he had himself temporarily exiled ,  he now released from their penalty
 nam Silana fato functa erat , longinquo ab exilio Tarentum regressa labante iam Agrippina , cuius inimicitiis conciderat , vel tamen mitigata$$ Silana indeed had died a natural death at Tarentum ,  whither she had returned from her distant exile ,  when the power of Agrippina ,  to whose enmity she owed her fall ,  began to totter ,  or her wrath was at last appeased
 Cunctari tamen in oppidis Campaniae , quonam modo urbem ingrederetur , an obsequium senatus , an studia plebis reperiret anxius contra deterrimus quisque , quorum non alia regia fecundior extitit , invisum Agrippinae nomen et morte eius accensum populi favorem disserunt$$ While Nero was lingering in the towns of Campania ,  doubting how he should enter Rome ,  whether he would find the Senate submissive and the populace enthusiastic ,  all the vilest courtiers ,  and of these never had a court a more abundant crop ,  argued against his hesitation by assuring him that Agrippina's name was hated and that her death had heightened his popularity

 simul praegredi exposcunt$$ They insisted at the same time on preceding him

 enimvero cantus Apollini sacros , talique ornatu adstare non modo Graecis in urbibus , sed Romana apud templa numen praecipuum et praescium$$ it was celebrated too in the praises of poets and was meant to show honour to the gods Songs indeed ,  he said ,  were sacred to Apollo ,  and it was in the dress of a singer that that great and prophetic deity was seen in Roman temples as well as in Greek cities

 mox ultro vocari populus Romanus laudibusque extollere , ut est vulgus cupiens voluptatum et , se eodem princeps trahat , laetum$$ Soon he actually invited all the people of Rome ,  who extolled him in their praises ,  like a mob which craves for amusements and rejoices when a prince draws them the same way
 ceterum evulgatus pudor non satietatum , ut rebantur , sed incitamentum attulit$$ However ,  the public exposure of his shame acted on him as an incentive instead of sickening him ,  as men expected
 ratusque dedecus moliri , si plures foedasset , nobilium familiarum posteros egestate venales in scaenam deduxit$$ Imagining that he mitigated the scandal by disgracing many others ,  he brought on the stage descendants of noble families ,  who sold themselves because they were paupers
 quos fato perfunctos ne nominatim tradam , maioribus eorum tribuendum puto$$ As they have ended their days ,  I think it due to their ancestors not to hand down their names

 notos quoque equites Romanos operas arenae promittere subegit donis ingentibus , nisi quod merces ab eo , qui iubere potest , vim necessitatis adfert$$ He prevailed too on some well-known Roman knights ,  by immense presents ,  to offer their services in the amphitheatre only pay from one who is able to command ,  carries with it the force of compulsion
 Ne tamen adhuc publico theatro dehonestaretur , instituit ludos Iuvenalium vocabulo , in quos passim nomina data$$ Still ,  not yet wishing to disgrace himself on a public stage ,  he instituted some games under the title of juvenile sports ,  for which people of every class gave in their names
 non nobilitas cuiquam , non aetas aut acti honores impedimento , quo minus Graeci Latinive histrionis artem exercerent usque ad gestus modosque haud viriles$$ Neither rank nor age nor previous high promotion hindered any one from practising the art of a Greek or Latin actor and even stooping to gestures and songs unfit for a man
 quin et feminae inlustres deformia meditari exstructaque apud nemus , quod navali stagno circumposuit Augustus , conventicula et cauponae et posita veno inritamenta luxui$$ Noble ladies too actually played disgusting parts ,  and in the grove ,  with which Augustus had surrounded the lake for the naval fight ,  there were erected places for meeting and refreshment ,  and every incentive to excess was offered for sale
 dabantur stipes , quas boni necessitate , intemperantes gloria consumerent$$ Money too was distributed ,  which the respectable had to spend under sheer compulsion and which the profligate gloried in squandering
 inde gliscere flagitia et infamia , nec ulla moribus olim corruptis plus libidinum circumdedit quam illa conluvies$$ Hence a rank growth of abominations and of all infamy Never did a more filthy rabble add a worse licentiousness to our long corrupted morals
 vix artibus honestis pudor retinetur , nedum inter certamina vitiorum pudicitia aut modestia aut quicquam probi moris reservaretur$$ Even ,  with virtuous training ,  purity is not easily upheld far less amid rivalries in vice could modesty or propriety or any trace of good manners be preserved
 postremus ipse scaenam incedit , multa cura temptans citharam et praemeditans adsistentibus phonascis$$ Last of all ,  the emperor himself came on the stage ,  tuning his lute with elaborate care and trying his voice with his attendants
 accesserat cohors militum , centuriones tribunique et maerens Burrus ac laudans$$ There were also present ,  to complete the show ,  a guard of soldiers with centurions and tribunes ,  and Burrus ,  who grieved and yet applauded
 tuncque primum conscripti sunt equites Romani cognomento Augustianorum , aetate ac robore conspicui , et pars ingenio procaces , alii in spem potentiae$$ Then it was that Roman knights were first enrolled under the title of Augustani ,  men in their prime and remarkable for their strength ,  some ,  from a natural frivolity ,  others from the hope of promotion
 ii dies ac noctes plausibus personare , formam principis vocemque deum vocabulis appellantes$$ Day and night they kept up a thunder of applause ,  and applied to the emperor's person and voice the epithets of deities

 igitur abiudicatis agris orta adversus iudicem invidia et senatus ignota sibi esse mandata Claudii et consulendum principem respondit$$ Consequently ,  when the adjudication was against them ,  there arose a bitter feeling towards the judge ,  but the Senate replied that they knew nothing of the instructions given by Claudius ,  and that the emperor must be consulted
 Nero , probata Strabonis sententia , se nihilo minus subvenire sociis et usurpata concedere rescripsit$$ Nero ,  though he approved Strabo's decision ,  wrote word that nevertheless he was for relieving the allies ,  and that he waived all claim to what had been taken into possession
 Sequuntur virorum inlustrium mortes , Domitii Afri et Marcus Servilii , qui summis honoribus et multa eloquentia viguerant , ille orando causas , Servilius diu foro , mox tradendis rebus Romanis celebris et elegantia vitae , quod clariorem effecit , ut par ingenio , ita morum diversus$$ Then followed the deaths of two illustrious men ,  Domitius Afer and Marcus Servilius ,  who had flourished through a career of the highest honours and great eloquence The first was a pleader Servilius ,  after long practice in the courts ,  distinguished himself by his history of Rome and by the refinement of his life ,  which the contrast of his character to that of Afer ,  whom he equalled in genius ,  rendered the more conspicuous
 Nerone quartum Cornelio Cosso consulibus quinquennale ludicrum Romae institutum est ad morum Graeci certaminis , varia fama , ut cunta ferme nova$$ In Nero's fourth consulship with Cornelius Cossus for his colleague ,  a theatrical entertainment to be repeated every five years was established at Rome in imitation of the Greek festival
 quippe erant qui Gnaeus quoque Pompeium incusatum a senioribus ferrent , quod mansuram theatri sedem posuisset$$ Like all novelties ,  it was variously canvassed There were some who declared that even Cnius Pompeius was censured by the older men of the day for having set up a fixed and permanent theatre
 nam antea subitariis gradibus et scaena in tempus structa ludos edi solitos , vel si vetustiora repetas , stantem populum spectavisse , ne , si consideret theatro , dies totos ignavia continuaret$$ Formerly ,  they said ,  the games were usually exhibited with hastily erected tiers of benches and a temporary stage ,  and the people stood to witness them ,  that they might not ,  by having the chance of sitting down ,  spend a succession of entire days in idleness
 ne spectaculorum quidem antiquitas servaretur , quotiens praetor sederet , nulla cuiquam civium necessitate certandi$$ Let the ancient character of these shows be retained ,  whenever the praetors exhibited them ,  and let no citizen be under the necessity of competing
 ceterum abolitos paulatim patrios mores funditus everti per accitam lasciviam , ut , quod usquam corrumpi et corrumpere queat , in urbe visatur , degeneretque studiis externis iuventus , gymnasia et otia et turpes amores exercendo , principe et senatu auctoribus , qui non modo licentiam vitiis permiserint , sed vim adhibeant , ut proceres Romani specie orationum et carminum scaena polluantur$$ As it was ,  the morality of their fathers ,  which had by degrees been forgotten ,  was utterly subverted by the introduction of a lax tone ,  so that all which could suffer or produce corruption was to be seen at Rome ,  and a degeneracy bred by foreign tastes was infecting the youth who devoted themselves to athletic sports ,  to idle loungings and low intrigues ,  with the encouragement of the emperor and Senate ,  who not only granted licence to vice ,  but even applied a compulsion to drive Roman nobles into disgracing themselves on the stage ,  under the pretence of being orators and poets
 quid superesse , nisi ut corpora quoque nudent et caestus adsumant easque pugnas pro militia et armis meditentur$$ What remained for them but to strip themselves naked ,  put on the boxing-glove ,  and practise such battles instead of the arms of legitimate warfare
 an iustitiam auctum iri et decurias equitum egregium iudicandi munus melius expleturos , si fractos sonos et dulcedinem vocum perite audissent$$ Would justice be promoted ,  or would they serve on the knights' commissions for the honourable office of a judge ,  because they had listened with critical sagacity to effeminate strains of music and sweet voices
 noctes quoque dedecori adiectas , ne quod tempus pudori relinquatur , sed coetu promisco , quod perditissimus quisque per diem concupiverit , per tenebras audeat$$ Night too was given up to infamy ,  so that virtue had not a moment left to her ,  but all the vilest of that promiscuous throng dared to do in the darkness anything they had lusted for in the day
 Pluribus ipsa licentia placebat , ac tamen honesta nomina praetendebant$$ Many people liked this very licence ,  but they screened it under respectable names
 maiores quoque non abhorruisse spectaculorum oblectamentis pro fortuna , quae tum erat , eoque a Tuscis accitos histriones , a Thuriis equorum certamina$$ Our ancestors ,  they said ,  were not averse to the attractions of shows on a scale suited to the wealth of their day ,  and so they introduced actors from the Etruscans and horse-races from Thurii
 et possessa Achaia Asiaque ludos curatius editos , nec quemquam Romae honesto loco ortum ad theatrales artes degeneravisse , ducentis iam annis a Lucius Mummi triumpho , qui primus id genus spectaculi in urbe praebuerit$$ When we had possessed ourselves of Achaia and Asia ,  games were exhibited with greater elaboration ,  and yet no one at Rome of good family had stooped to the theatrical profession during the 200 years following the triumph of Lucius Mummius ,  who first displayed this kind of show in the capital
 sed et consultum parsimoniae , quod perpetua sedes theatro locata sit potius , quam immenso sumptu singulos per annos consurgeret ac destrueretur$$ Besides ,  even economy had been consulted ,  when a permanent edifice was erected for a theatre ,  in preference to a structure raised and fitted up yearly at vast expense
 nec perinde magistratus rem familiarem exhausturos aut populo efflagitandi Graeca certamina a magistratibus causam fore , cum eo sumptu res publica fungatur$$ Nor would the magistrates ,  as hitherto ,  exhaust their substance ,  or would the populace have the same motive for demanding of them the Greek contests ,  when once the State undertakes the expenditure
 oratorum ac vatum victorias incitamentum ingeniis adlaturas nec cuiquam iudici grave aures studiis honestis et voluptatibus concessis impertire$$ The victories won by orators and poets would furnish a stimulus to genius ,  and it could not be a burden for any judge to bestow his attention on graceful pursuits or on legitimate recreations
 laetitiae magis quam lasciviae dari paucas totius quinquennii noctes , quibus tanta luce ignium nihil inlicitum occultari queat$$ It was to mirth rather than to profligacy that a few nights every five years were devoted ,  and in these amid such a blaze of illumination no lawless conduct could be concealed
 sane nullo insigni dehonestamento id spectaculum transiit$$ This entertainment ,  it is true ,  passed off without any notorious scandal
 ac ne modica quidem studia plebis exarsere , quid redditi quamquam scaenae pantomimi certaminibus sacris prohibebantur$$ The enthusiasm too of the populace was not even slightly kindled ,  for the pantomimic actors ,  though permitted to return to the stage ,  were excluded from the sacred contests

 ex quis Gaius Cassius sententiae loco in hunc modum disseruit$$ Of these ,  Caius Cassius ,  in giving his vote ,  argued to the following effect

 simul quicquid hoc in nobis auctoritatis est , crebris contradictionibus destruendum non existimabam , ut maneret integrum , si quando res publica consiliis eguisset$$ At the same time I thought that any influence I possess ought not to be destroyed by incessant protests ,  wishing that it might remain unimpaired ,  should the State ever need my counsels

 Libet argumenta conquirere in eo , quod sapientioribus deliberatum est$$ Is it your pleasure to search for arguments in a matter already weighed in the deliberations of wiser men than ourselves

 vixit tamen post haec Regulus , quiete defensus et quia nova generis claritudine neque invidiosis opibus erat$$ Yet Regulus lived after this ,  protected by his retiring habits ,  and by the fact that he was a man of newly-risen family and of wealth which did not provoke envy

 valetudo ex eo coniectabatur , quod in se tumescentibus paulatim faucibus et impedito meatu spiritum finiebat$$ Burrus died ,  whether from illness or from poison was a question It was supposed to be illness from the fact that from the gradual swelling of his throat inwardly and the closing up of the passage he ceased to breathe

 quin , si qua in parte lubricum adulescentiae nostrae declinat , revocas ornatumque robur subsidio impensius regis$$ Why not rather ,  if the frailty of my youth goes in any respect astray ,  call me back and guide yet more zealously with your help the manhood which you have instructed

 Seneca , qui finis omnium cum dominante sermonum , grates agit$$ Seneca thanked him ,  the usual end of an interview with a despot

 longinquos motus quonam modo comprimi posse erectas Gallias ad nomen dictatorium , nec minus suspensos Asiae populos claritudine avi Drusi$$ Gaul is roused at the name of the great dictator ,  and I distrust no less the nations of Asia ,  because of the renown of such a grandfather as Drusus
 Sullam inopem , unde praecipuam audaciam , et simulatione segnitiae , dum temeritati locum reperiret$$ Sulla is poor ,  and hence comes his surpassing audacity he shams apathy ,  while he is seeking an opening for his reckless ambition

 Sulla sexto die pervectis Massiliam percussoribus ante metum et rumorem interficitur , cum epulandi causa discumberet$$ Sulla ,  six days afterwards ,  was murdered by assassins brought over to Massilia ,  while he was reclining at the dinner-table ,  before he feared or heard of his danger

 quin et Asiam favore iuvenis arma cepisse , nec milites ad scelus missos aut numero validos aut animo promptos , postquam iussa efficere nequiverint , ad spes novas transisse$$ Again Asia ,  it was said ,  from its partiality for the young man ,  had taken up arms ,  and the soldiers sent to do the crime ,  not being sufficient in number or decided in purpose ,  and ,  finding themselves unable to execute their orders ,  had gone over to the new cause

 sed ad senatum litteras misit de caede Sullae Plautique haud confessus , verum utriusque turbidum ingenium esse , et sibi incolumitatem rei publicae magna cura haberi$$ He wrote ,  however ,  a letter to the Senate ,  confessing nothing about the murders of Sulla and Plautus ,  but merely hinting that both had a restless temper ,  and that he gave the most anxious thought to the safety of the State

 neque tamen silebimus , si quod senatus consultum adulatione novum aut paenitentia postremum fuit$$ Still ,  if any decree of the Senate was marked by some new flattery ,  or by the lowest servility ,  I shall not pass it over in silence

 hunc ego eodem mecum patre genitum , cum mihi per aetatem summo nomine concessisset , in possessionem Armeniae deduxi , qui tertius potentiae gradus habetur (nam Medos Pacorus ante ceperat) , videbarque contra vetera fratrum odia et certamina familiae nostrae penates rite composuisse$$  This man before you ,  born from the same father as myself ,  having waived in my favour ,  on the ground of age ,  the highest title of all ,  was established by me in the possession of Armenia ,  which is accounted the third grade of power As for Media ,  Pacorus was already in possession of it And I thought to myself that I had duly arranged our family and home so as to guard against the old feuds and rivalries of brothers
 prohibent Romani et pacem numquam ipsis prospere lacessitam nunc quoque in exitium suum abrumpunt$$ The Romans thwart me ,  and though they have never with success to themselves disturbed the peace between us ,  they are now again breaking it to their own destruction
 non ibo infitias$$ I will not attempt to deny one thing

 vestra quidem vis et gloria in integro est , addita modestiae fama , quae neque summis mortalium spernenda est et a dis aestimatur$$ Assuredly your strength and renown are at their height ,  and you have in addition the repute of obedience ,  which the greatest of mortals must not despise ,  and which the gods highly esteem
 simul diademate caput Tiridatis evinxit , promptam equitum manum , quae regem ex more sectatur , Monaesi nobili viro tradidit , adiectis Adiabenorum auxiliis , mandavitque Tigranen Armenia exturbare , dum ipse positis adversus Hyrcanos discordiis vires intimas molemque belli ciet , provinciis Romanis minitans$$ As he spoke ,  he encircled Tiridates' brow with a diadem ,  and to Moneses ,  a noble ,  he entrusted a highly efficient body of cavalry ,  which was the king's customary escort ,  giving him also some auxiliaries from the Adiabeni ,  and orders that Tigranes was to be driven out of Armenia He would himself abandon his feud with the Hyrcanians ,  and raise his own national force in all its warlike strength by way of menace to the Roman provinces
 Quae ubi Corbuloni certis nuntiis audita sunt , legiones duas cum Verulano Severo et Vettio Bolano subsidium Tigrani mittit , occulto praecepto , compositius cuncta quam festinantius agerent quippe bellum habere quam gerere malebat , scripseratque Caesari proprio duce opus esse , qui Armeniam defenderet Syriam ingruente Vologaese acriore in discrimine esse$$ When Corbulo had heard all this from messengers he could trust ,  he sent two legions under Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the support of Tigranes ,  with secret instructions that they were to conduct all their operations with deliberation rather than despatch ,  as he would prefer to sustain rather than to make war And indeed he had written to the emperor that a general was wanted specially for the defence of Armenia ,  and that Syria ,  threatened as it was by Vologeses ,  was in yet more imminent peril
 atque interim reliquas legiones pro ripa Euphratis locat , tumultuariam provincialium manum armat , hostiles ingressus praesidiis intercipit$$ Meanwhile he posted his remaining legions on the bank of the Euphrates ,  armed a hastily collected force of provincials ,  and occupied with troops the enemy's approaches
 et quia egena aquarum regio est , castella fontibus imposita quosdam rivos congestu harenae abdidit$$ And as the country was deficient in water ,  he established forts to guard the wells ,  and concealed some of the streams with heaps of sand

 occupaverat Tigranocertam , urbem copia defensorum et magnitudine moenium validam$$ He had ,  in fact ,  occupied Tigranocerta ,  a city strong from the multitude of its defenders and the vastness of its fortifications
 ad hoc Nicephorius amnis haud spernenda latitudine partem murorum ambit , et ducta ingens fossa , qua fluvio diffidebatur$$ In addition ,  the river Nicephorius ,  the breadth of which is far from contemptible ,  circled a portion of its walls ,  and a wide fosse was drawn where they distrusted the protection of the stream
 inerantque milites et provisi ante commeatus , quorum subvectu pauci avidius progressi et repentinis hostibus circumventi ira magis quam metu ceteros accenderant$$ There were some soldiers too ,  and supplies previously provided In the conveyance of these a few men had hurried on too eagerly ,  and ,  having been surprised by a sudden attack from the enemy ,  had inspired their comrades with rage rather than fear
 sed Partho ad exsequendas obsidiones nulla comminus audacia$$ But the Parthian has not the daring in close combat needed for a successful siege
 raris sagittis neque clausos exterret et semet frustratur$$ His thin showers of arrows do not alarm men within walls ,  and only disappoint himself
 Adiabeni cum promovere scalas et machinamenta inciperent , facile detrusi , mox erumpentibus nostris caeduntur$$ The Adiabeni ,  when they began to advance their scaling ladders and engines ,  were easily driven back ,  and then cut down by a sally of our men
 Corbulo tamen , quamvis secundis rebus suis , moderandum fortunae ratus misit ad Vologaesen , qui expostularent vim provinciae inlatam socium amicumque regem , cohortes Romanas circumsederi$$ Corbulo ,  however ,  notwithstanding his successes thought he must use his good fortune with moderation ,  and sent Vologeses a message of remonstrance against the violence done to a Roman province ,  and the blockade of an allied and friendly king and of Roman cohorts
 omitteret potius obsidionem , aut se quoque in agro hostili castra positurum$$ He had better give up the siege ,  or he ,  Corbulo too would encamp in his territory ,  as on hostile ground
 Casperius centurio in eam legationem delectus apud oppidum Nisibin , septem et triginta milibus passuum a Tigranocerta distantem , adit regem et mandata ferociter edidit$$ Casperius ,  a centurion selected for this mission ,  had an interview with the king at the town Nisibis ,  thirty-seven miles distant from Tigranocerta ,  and with fearless spirit announced his message
 Vologaesi vetus et penitus infixum erat arma romana vitandi , nec praesentia prospere fluebant$$ With Vologeses it was an old and deep conviction that he should shun the arms of Rome
 inritum obsidium , tutus manu et copiis Tigranes , fugati qui expugnationem sumpserant , missae in Armeniam legiones , et alia pro Syria paratae ultro inrumpere$$ Nor was the present going smoothly with him The seige was a failure Tigranes was safe with his troops and supplies those who had undertaken the storming of the place had been routed
 sibi imbecillum equitem pabuli inopia nam exorta vi locustarum aberat quicquid herbidum aut frondosum$$ legions had been sent into Armenia ,  and other legions were ready to rush to the attack on behalf of Syria ,  while his own cavalry was crippled by want of food
 igitur metu abstruso mitiora obtendens , missurum ad imperatorem Romanum legatos super petenda Armenia et firmanda pace respondet Monaesen omittere Tigranocertam iubet , ipse retro concedit$$ A host of locusts ,  suddenly appearing ,  had devoured every blade of grass and every leaf And so ,  hiding his fear and presenting a more conciliatory attitude ,  he replied that he would send envoys to the Roman emperor for the possession of Armenia and the conclusion of a lasting peace
 Interim Corbulo numquam neglectam Euphratis ripam crebrioribus praesidiis insedit$$ Meanwhile Corbulo occupied the bank of the Euphrates ,  which he had never neglected ,  with troops at closer intervals
 et ne ponti iniciendo impedimentum hostiles turmae adferrent (iam enim subiectis magna specie volitabant) , naves magnitudine praestantes et conexas trabibus ac turribus auctas agit per amnem catapultisque et balistis proturbat barbaros , in quos saxa et hastae longius permeabant , quam ut contrario sagittarum iactu adaequarentur$$ That he might have no hindrance in throwing a bridge over it from the enemy's cavalry ,  which was already scouring the adjoining plains with a formidable display ,  he launched on the river some vessels of remarkable size ,  linked together by beams ,  with towers rising from their decks ,  and with catapults and balistas he drove off the barbarians
 dein pons continuatus collesque adversi per socias cohortes , post legionum castris occupantur , tanta celeritate et ostentatione virium , ut Parthi omisso paratu invadendae Syriae spem omnem in Armeniam verterent , ubi Paetus imminentium nescius quintam legionem procul in Ponto habebat , reliquas promiscis militum commeatibus infirmaverat , donec adventare Vologaesen magno et infenso agmine auditum$$ The stones and spears penetrated their host at a range beyond the reach of the opposing volleys of arrows The bridge was then completed ,  and the hills facing us were occupied by our auxiliary infantry ,  then ,  by the entrenchments of the legions ,  with such rapidity and such a display of force that the Parthians ,  giving up their preparations for the invasion of Syria ,  concentrated all their hopes on Armenia
 Accitur legio duodecima , et unde famam aucti exercitus speraverat , prodita infrequentia$$ Paetus ,  ignorant of the impending danger ,  was keeping the 5th legion at a distance in Pontus
 qua tamen retineri castra et eludi Parthus tractu belli poterat , si Paeto aut in suis aut in alienis consiliis constantia fuisset$$ the rest he had weakened by indiscriminate furloughs ,  till it was heard that Vologeses was approaching with a powerful force bent on war
 verum ubi a viris militaribus adversus urgentes casus firmatus erat , rursus , ne alienae sententiae indigens videretur , in diversa ac deteriora transibat$$ He summoned the 12th legion ,  and then was discovered the numerical feebleness of the source from which he had hoped for the repute of an augmented army
 et tunc relictis hibernis non fossam neque vallum sibi , sed corpora et arma in hostem data clamitans , duxit legiones quasi proelio certaturus$$ Yet even thus the camp might have been held ,  and the Parthian foe baffled ,  by protracting the war ,  had Paetus stood firm either by his own counsels or by those of others
 deinde amisso centurione et paucis militibus , quos visendis hostium copiis praemiserat , trepidus remeavit$$ But though military men had put him on his guard against imminent disasters ,  still ,  not wishing to seem to need the advice of others ,  he would fall back on some quite different and inferior plan
 et quia minus acriter Vologaeses institerat , vana rursus fiducia tria milia delicti peditis proximo Tauri iugo imposuit , quo transitum regis arcerent$$ So now ,  leaving his winter quarters ,  and exclaiming that not the fosse or the rampart ,  but the men's bodies and weapons were given him for facing the foe ,  he led out his legions ,  as if he meant to fight a battle
 alares quoque Pannonios , robur equitatus , in parte campi locat$$ Then ,  after losing a centurion and a few soldiers whom he had sent on in advance to reconnoitre the enemy's forces ,  he returned in alarm
 coniux ac filius castello , cui Arsamosata nomen est , abditi , data in praesidium cohorte ac disperso milite , qui in uno habitus vagum hostem promptius sustentavisset aegre compulsum ferunt , ut instantem Corbuloni fateretur$$ And ,  as Vologeses had not pressed his advantage with much vigour ,  Paetus once again ,  with vain confidence ,  posted 3000 chosen infantry on the adjacent ridge of the taurus ,  in order to bar the king's passage He also stationed some Pannonian troopers ,  the flower of his cavalry ,  in a part of the plain
 nec a Corbulone properatum , quo gliscentibus periculis etiam subsidii laus augeretur$$ His wife and son he removed to a fortress named Arsamosata ,  with a cohort for their defence ,  thus dispersing the troops which ,  if kept together ,  could easily have checked the desultory skirmishing of the enemy
 expediri tamen itineri singula milia ex tribus legionibus et alarios octingentos , parem numerum e cohortibus iussit$$ He could ,  it is said ,  scarcely be driven to confess to Corbulo how the enemy was pressing him
 At Vologaeses , quamvis obsessa a Paeto itinera hinc peditatu inde equite accepisset , nihil mutato consilio , sed vi ac minis alares exterruit , legionarios obtrivit , uno tantum centurione Tarquitio Crescente turrim , in qua praesidium agitabat , defendere auso factaque saepius eruptione et caesis , qui barbarorum propius suggrediebantur , donec ignium iactu circumveniretur$$ Vologeses meanwhile ,  though he had heard that the roads were blocked by Paetus ,  here with infantry ,  there with cavalry ,  did not alter his plan ,  but drove off the latter by the menace of an attack ,  and crushed the legionaires ,  only one centurion of whom ,  Tarquitius Crescens ,  dared to defend a tower in which he was keeping guard He had often sallied out ,  and cut to pieces such of the barbarians as came close up to the walls ,  till he was overwhelmed with volleys of firebrands
 peditum si quis integer , longinqua et avia , vulnerati castra repetivere , virtutem regis , saevitiam et copias gentium , cuncta metu extollentes , facili credulitate eorum , qui eadem pavebant$$ Every foot soldier still unwounded fled to remote wilds ,  and those who were disabled ,  returned to the camp ,  exaggerating in their terror the king's valour ,  and the warlike strength of his tribes ,  everything in short ,  to the simple credulity of those who trembled with like fear
 ne dux quidem obniti adversis , sed cuncta militiae munia deseruerat , missis iterum ad Corbulonem precibus , veniret propere , signa et aquilas et nomen reliquum infelicis exercitus tueretur$$ Even the general did not struggle against his reverses He had indeed wholly abandoned all the duties of a soldier ,  and had again sent an entreaty to Corbulo ,  that he would come with speed to save the standards and eagles ,  and the name yet left to the unfortunate army
 se fidem interim , donec vita suppeditet , retenturos$$ they meantime ,  he said ,  would hold to their fidelity while life lasted
 Ille interritus et parte copiarum apud Syriam relicta , ut munimenta Euphrati imposita retinerentur , qua proximum et commeatibus non egenum , regionem Commagenam , exim Cappadociam , inde Armenios petivit$$ Corbulo ,  perfectly fearless ,  left half his army in Syria to retain the forts built on the Euphrates ,  and taking the nearest route ,  which also was not deficient in supplies ,  marched through the country of Commagene ,  then through Cappadocia ,  and thence into Armenia
 comitabantur exercitum praeter alia sueta bello magna vis camelorum onusta frumenti , ut simul hostem famemque depelleret$$ Beside the other usual accompaniments of war ,  his army was followed by a great number of camels laden with corn ,  to keep off famine as well as the enemy
 primum e perculsis Paccium primi pili centurionem obvium habuit , dein plerosque militum quos diversas fugae causas obtendentes redire ad signa et clementiam Paeti experiri monebat$$ The first he met of the defeated army was Paccius ,  a first-rank centurion ,  then many of the soldiers ,  whom ,  when they pleaded various excuses for flight ,  he advised to return to their standards and throw themselves on the mercy of Paetus
 se nisi victoribus immitem esse$$ For himself ,  he said ,  he had no forgiveness but for the victorious
 simul suas legiones adire , hortari priorum admonere , novam gloriam ostendere$$ As he spoke ,  he went up to his legions ,  cheering them and reminding them of their past career ,  and pointing the way to new glory
 non vicos aut oppida Armeniorum , sed castra Romana duasque in iis legiones pretium laboris peti$$ It was not to villages or towns of Armenia ,  but to a Roman camp with two legions ,  a worthy recompense for their efforts ,  that they were bound
 si singulis manipularibus praecipua servati civis corona imperatoria manu tribueretur , quod illud et quantum decus , ubi par eorum numerus aspiceretur , qui adtulissent salutem et qui accepissent! his atque talibus in commune alacres (et erant quos pericula fratrum aut propinquorum propriis stimulis incenderent) continuum diu noctuque iter properabant$$ If each common soldier were to have bestowed on him by the emperor's hand the special honour of a crown for a rescued citizen ,  how wonderfully great the glory ,  when the numbers would be equal of those who had brought and of those had received deliverance Roused by these and like words into a common enthusiasm ,  and some too were filled with an ardour peculiarly their own by the perils of brothers and kinsfolk ,  they hurried on by day and night their uninterrupted march
 Eoque intentius Vologaeses premere obsessos , modo vallum legionum , modo castellum , quo imbellis aetas defendebatur , adpugnare , propius incedens quam mos Parthis , si ea temeritate hostem in proelium eliceret$$ All the more vigorously did Vologeses press the besieged ,  now attacking the legions' entrenchments ,  and now again the fortress ,  which guarded those whose years unfitted them for war He advanced closer than is the Parthian practice ,  seeking to lure the enemy to an engagement by such rashness
 at illi vix contuberniis extracti , nec aliud quam munimenta propugnabant , pars iussu ducis , et alii propria ignavia aut Corbulonem opperientes , ac vis si ingrueret , provisis exemplis Caudinae Numantinaeque pacis$$ They ,  however ,  could hardly be dragged out of their tents ,  and would merely defend their lives ,  some held back by the general's order ,  others by their own cowardice they seemed to be awaiting Corbulo ,  and should they be overpowered by force ,  they had before them the examples of Candium and Numantia
 neque eandem vim Samnitibus , Italico populo , aut Hispanis quam Parthis , Romani imperii aemulis validam quoque et laudatam antiquitatem , quotiens fortuna contra daret , saluti consuluisse$$ Neither the Samnites ,  Italian people as they were ,  nor the Carthaginians ,  the rivals of the Roman empire ,  were ,  it seemed ,  equally formidable ,  and even the men of old ,  with all their strength and glory ,  whenever fortune was adverse ,  had taken thought for safety
 qua desperatione exercitus dux subactus primas tamen litteras ad Vologaesen non supplices , sed in modum querentis composuit , quod pro Armeniis semper Romanae dicionis aut subiectis regi , quem imperator delegisset , hostilia faceret$$ The general ,  although he was overcome by the despair of his army ,  first wrote a letter to Vologeses ,  not a suppliant petition ,  but in a tone of remonstrance against the doing of hostile acts on behalf of the Armenians ,  who always had been under Roman dominion ,  or subject to a king chosen by the emperor
 pacem ex aequo utilem ne praesentia tantum spectaret$$ Peace ,  he reminded him ,  was equally for the interest of both ,  and it would be well for him not to look only at the present
 ipsum adversus duas legiones totis regni viribus advenisse at Romanis orbem terrarum reliquum , quo bellum iuvarent$$ He indeed had advanced with the whole strength of his kingdom against two legions ,  while the Romans had all the rest of the world with which to sustain the war
 Ad eo Vologaeses nihil pro causa , sed opperiendos sibi fratres Pacorum ac Tiridaten rescripsit illum locum tempusque consilio destinatum , quid de Armenia cernerent adiecisse deos dignum Arsacidarum , simul ut de legionibus Romanis statuerent$$ To this Vologeses replied nothing to the purpose ,  but merely that he must wait for his brothers Pacorus and Tiridates ,  that the place and time of their meeting had been fixed on as the occasion when they would decide about Armenia ,  and that heaven had granted them a further honour ,  well worthy of the Arsacids ,  the having to determine the fate of Roman legions
 missi posthac Paeto nuntii et regis conloquium petitum , qui Vasacen praefectum equitatus ire iussit$$ Messengers were then despatched by Paetus and an interview requested with the king ,  who ordered Vasaces ,  the commander of the cavalry ,  to go
 tum Paetus Lucullos , Pompeios et si qua Caesares obtinendae donandaeve Armeniae egerant , Vasaces imaginem retinendi largiendive penes nos , vim penes Parthos memorat$$ Thereupon Paetus dwelt on the memories of the Luculli and Pompeii ,  and of all that the Caesars had done in the way of holding or giving away Armenia ,  while Vasaces declared that we had the mere shadow of possession and of bestowing ,  but the Parthians ,  the reality of power
 et multum in vicem disceptato , Monobazus Adiabenus in diem posterum testis iis quae pepigissent adhibetur$$ After much arguing on both sides ,  Monobazus of the Adiabeni was called the next day to be a witness to the stipulations into which they had entered
 placuitque liberari obsidio legiones et decedere omnem militem finibus Armeniorum castellaque et commeatus Parthis tradi , quibus perpetratis copia Vologaesi fieret mittendi ad Neronem legatos$$ It was agreed that the legions should be released from the blockade ,  that all the troops should quit Armenian territory ,  and that the forts and supplies should be surrendered to the Parthians ,  and when all this had been completed ,  Vologeses was to have full permission to send envoys to Nero
 Interim flumini Arsaniae (is castra praefluebat) pontem imposuit , specie sibi illud iter expedientis , sed Parthi quasi documentum victoriae iusserant$$ Meanwhile Paetus threw a bridge over the river Arsanias ,  which flowed by the camp ,  apparently with the view of facilitating his march It was the Parthians ,  however ,  who had required this ,  as an evidence of their victory
 namque iis usui fuit , nostri per diversum iere$$ for the bridge was of use to them ,  while our men went a different way
 addidit rumor sub iugum missas legiones et alia ex rebus infaustis , quorum simulacrum ab Armeniis usurpatum est$$ Rumour added that the legions had been passed under the yoke ,  with other miserable disgraces ,  of which the Armenians had borrowed imitations
 namque et munimenta ingressi sunt , antequam agmen Romanum excederet , et circumstetere vias , captiva olim mancipia aut iumenta adgnoscentes abstrahentesque$$ For they not only entered our lines before the Roman army began to retire ,  but also stood about the camp streets ,  recognizing and dragging off slaves or beasts of burden which we had previously captured
 raptae etiam vestes , retenta arma , pavido milite et concedente , ne qua proelii causa existeret$$ They even seized clothes and detained weapons ,  for the soldiers were utterly cowed and gave up everything ,  so that no cause for fighting might arise
 Vologaeses armis et corporibus caesorum aggeratis , quo cladem nostram testaretur , visu fugientium legionum abstinuit$$ Vologeses having piled up the arms and bodies of the slain in order to attest our defeat ,  refrained from gazing on the fugitive legions
 fama moderationis quaerebatur , postquam superbiam expleverat$$ He sought a character for moderation after he had glutted his pride
 flumen Arsaniam elephanto insidens , proximus quisque regem vi equorum perrupere , quia rumor incesserat pontem cessurum oneri dolo fabricantium$$ Seated himself on an elephant ,  he crossed the river Arsanias ,  while those next to his person rushed through it at the utmost speed of their horses
 sed qui ingredi ausi sunt , validum et fidum intellexere$$ for a rumour had gained ground that the bridge would give way ,  through the trickery of its builders
 Ducum inter se brevis sermo secutus est , hoc conquerente inritum laborem , potuisse bellum fuga Parthorum finiri ille integra utrique cuncta respondit converterent aquilas et iuncti invaderent Armeniam abscessu Vologaesis infirmatam$$ Then followed a short conversation between the generals While Corbulo complained that his efforts had been fruitless and that the war might have been ended with the flight of the Parthians ,  Paetus replied that for neither of them was anything lost ,  and urged that they should reverse the eagles ,  and with their united forces invade Armenia ,  much weakened ,  as it was ,  by the departure of Vologeses
 non ea imperatoris habere mandata Corbulo$$ Corbulo said that he had no such instructions from the emperor
 periculo legionum commotum e provincia egressum quando in incerto habeantur Parthorum conatus , Syriam repetiturum sic quoque optimam fortunam orandam , ut pedes confectus spatiis itinerum alacrem et facilitate camporum praevenientem equitem adsequeretur$$ it was the peril of the legions which had stirred him to leave his province ,  and ,  as there was uncertainty about the designs of the Parthians ,  he should return to Syria ,  and ,  even as it was ,  he must pray for fortune under her most favourable aspect in order that the infantry ,  wearied out with long marches ,  might keep pace with the enemy's untiring cavalry ,  certain to outstrip him on the plains ,  which facilitated their movements
 exim Paetus per Cappadociam hibernavit$$ Paetus then went into winter quarters in Cappadocia
 at Vologaesi ad Corbulonem missi nuntii , detraheret castella trans Euphraten amnemque , ut olim , medium faceret$$ Vologeses ,  however ,  sent a message to Corbulo ,  requiring him to remove the fortresses on the further bank of the Euphrates ,  and to leave the river to be ,  as formerly ,  the boundary between them
 ille Armeniam quoque diversis praesidiis vacuam fieri expostulabat$$ Corbulo also demanded the evacuation of Armenia by the garrisons posted throughout it
 et postremo concessit rex dirutaque quae Euphraten ultra communiverat Corbulo , et Armenii sine arbitro relicti sunt$$ At last the king yielded ,  all the positions fortified by Corbulo beyond the Euphrates were destroyed ,  and the Armenians too left without a master
 At Romae tropaea de Parthis arcusque medio Capitolini montis sistebantur , decreta ab senatu integro adhuc bello neque tum omissa , dum adspectui consulitur spreta conscientia$$ At Rome meanwhile trophies for the Parthian war ,  and arches were erected in the centre of the Capitoline hill these had been decreed by the Senate ,  while the war was yet undecided ,  and even now they were not given up ,  appearances being consulted ,  in disregard of known facts
 quin et dissimulandis rerum externarum curis Nero frumentum plebis vetustate corruptum in Tiberim iecit , quo securitatem annonae sustentaret$$ And to hide his anxious fears about foreign affairs ,  Nero threw the people's corn ,  which was so old as to be spoilt ,  into the Tiber ,  with the view of keeping up a sense of security about the supplies

 Percrebuerat et tempestate pravus mos , cum propinquis comitiis aut sorte provinciarum plerique orbi fictis adoptionibus adsciscerent filios , praeturasque et provincias inter patres sortiti statim emitterent manu , quos adoptaverant$$ A very demoralizing custom had at this time become rife ,  of fictitious adoptions of children ,  on the eve of the elections or of the assignment of the provinces ,  by a number of childless persons ,  who ,  after obtaining along with real fathers praetorships and provinces ,  forthwith dismissed from paternal control the sons whom they had adopted
 igitur qui filios genuerant magna cum invidia senatum adeunt , ius naturae , labores educandi adversus fraudem et artes et brevitatem adoptionis enumerant$$ An appeal was made to the Senate under a keen sense of wrong Parents pleaded natural rights and the anxieties of nurture against fraudulent evasions and the brief ceremony of adoption
 satis pretii esse orbis , quod multa securitate , nullis oneribus gratiam honores , cuncta prompta et obvia haberent$$ It was ,  they argued ,  sufficient reward for the childless to have influence and distinction ,  everything ,  in short ,  easy and open to them ,  without a care and without a burden
 sibi promissa legum diu exspectata in ludibrium verti , quando quis sine sollicitudine parens , sine luctu orbus longa patrum vota repente adaequaret factum ex eo senatus consultum , ne simulata adoptio in ulla parte muneris publici iuvaret ac ne usurpandis quidem hereditatibus prodesset$$ For themselves ,  they found that the promises held out by the laws ,  for which they had long waited ,  were turned into mockery ,  when one who knew nothing of a parent's solicitude or of the sorrows of bereavement could rise in a moment to the level of a father's long deferred hopes On this ,  a decree of the Senate was passed that a fictitious adoption should be of no avail in any department of the public service ,  or even hold good for acquiring an inheritance
 Exim Claudius Timarchus Cretensis reus agitur , ceteris criminibus , ut solent praevalidi provincialium et opibus nimiis ad iniurias minorum elati$$ Next came the prosecution of Claudius Timarchus of Crete ,  on such charges as often fall on very influential provincials ,  whom immense wealth has emboldened to the oppression of the weak
 una vox eius usque ad contumeliam senatus penetraverat , quod dictitasset in sua potestate situm , an proconsulibus , qui Cretam obtinuissent , grates agerentur$$ But one speech of his had gone to the extremity of a gross insult to the Senate for he had repeatedly declared that it was in his power to decide whether the proconsuls who had governed Crete should receive the thanks of the province
 quam occasionem Paetus Thrasea ad bonum publicum vertens , postquam de reo censuerat provincia Creta depellendum , haec addidit$$ Paetus Thrasea ,  turning the occasion to public advantage ,  after having stated his opinion that the accused ought to be expelled from Crete ,  further spoke as follows

 Olim quidem non modo praetor aut consul , sed privati etiam mittebantur , qui provincias viserent et quid de cuiusque obsequio videretur referrent , trepidabantque gentes de aestimatione singulorum$$ Formerly ,  it was not only a praetor or a consul ,  but private persons also ,  who were sent to inspect the provinces ,  and to report what they thought about each man's loyalty And nations were timidly sensitive to the opinion of individuals
 at nunc colimus externos et adulamur , et quo modo ad nutum alicuius grates , ita promptius accusatio decernitur$$ But now we court foreigners and flatter them ,  and just as there is a vote of thanks at any one's pleasure ,  so even more eagerly is a prosecution decided on
 decernaturque et maneat provincialibus potentiam suam tali modo ostentandi sed laus falsa et precibus expressa perinde cohibeatur quam malitia , quam crudelitas$$ Well let it be decided on ,  and let the provincials retain the right of showing their power in this fashion ,  but as for false praise which has been extorted by entreaties ,  let it be as much checked as fraud or tyranny

 quae si arceantur , aequalibus atque constantius provinciae regentur$$ If such practices are stopped ,  our provinces will be ruled more equitably and more steadily
 nam ut metu repetundarum infracta avaritia est , ita vetita gratiarum actione ambitio cohibebitur$$ For as the dread of a charge of extortion has been a check to rapacity ,  so ,  by prohibiting the vote of thanks ,  will the pursuit of popularity be restrained
 Magno adsensu celebrata sententia non tamen senatus consultum perfici potuit abnuentibus consulibus ea de re relatum$$ This opinion was hailed with great unanimity ,  but the Senate's resolution could not be finally passed ,  as the consuls decided that there had been no formal motion on the subject
 mox auctore principe sanxere , ne quis ad concilium sociorum referret agendas apud senatum pro praetoribus prove consulibus grates , neu quis ea legatione fungeretur$$ Then ,  at the emperor's suggestion ,  they decreed that no one was to propose to any council of our allies that a vote of thanks ought to be given in the Senate to propraetors or proconsuls ,  and that no one was to discharge such a mission

 et additae supplicationes templumque fecunditatis et certamen ad exemplar Actiacae religionis decretum , utque Fortunarum effigies aureae in solio Capitolini Iovis locarentur , ludicrum circense , ut Iuliae genti apud Bovillas , ita Claudiae Domitiaeque apud Antium ederetur$$ To these was added a public thanksgiving ,  and a temple was decreed to the goddess of fecundity ,  as well as games and contests after the type of the ceremonies commemorative of Actium ,  and golden images of the two Fortunes were to be set up on the throne of Jupiter of the Capitol Shows too of the circus were to be exhibited in honour of the Claudian and Domitian families at Antium ,  like those at Bovillae in commemoration of the Julii

 secutam dehinc vocem Caesaris ferunt , qua reconciliatum se Thraseae apud Senecam iactaverit , ac Senecam Caesari gratulatum$$ Then followed ,  as rumour says ,  an expression from the emperor ,  in which he boasted to Seneca of his reconciliation with Thrasea ,  on which Seneca congratulated him
 unde gloria egregiis viris et pericula gliscebant$$ And now henceforth the glory and the peril of these illustrious men grew greater
 As Paetuss despatch contradicted this letter from Vologeses and implied that matters were unchanged , the centurion who had arrived with the envoys was questioned as to the state of Armenia He replied that all the Romans had quitted it$$ Inter quae veris principio legati Parthorum mandata regis Vologaesis litterasque in eandem formam attulere 
 Then was perceived the mockery of the barbarians in petitioning for what they had wrested from us , and Nero consulted with the chief men of the State whether they should accept a dangerous war or a disgraceful peace There was no hesitation about war Corbulo , who had known our soldiers and the enemy for so many years , was appointed to conduct it , that there might be no more blunders through any other officers incapacity$$  se priora et totiens iactata super obtineneda Armenia nunc omittere ,  quoniam dii ,  quamvis potentium populorum arbitri ,  possessionem Parthis non sine ignominia Romana tradidissent
 for people were utterly disgusted with Paetus So the envoys were sent back without an answer , but with some presents , in order to inspire a hope that Tiridates would not make the same request in vain , if only he presented his petition in person$$ nuper clausum Tigranen ,  post Paetum legionesque ,  cum opprimere posset ,  incolumes dimisisse
 The administration of Syria was intrusted to Caius Itius , and the military forces to Corbulo , to which was added the fifteenth legion , under the leadership of Marius Celsus , from Pannonia$$ satis adprobatam vim datum et lenitatis experimentum
 Written orders were sent to the tetrarchs , the tributaries , kings , prefects and procurators , and all the praetors who governed the neighbouring provinces , to obey Corbulos commands , as his powers were enlarged on much the same scale as that which the Roman people had granted to Cneius Pompeius on the eve of his war against the Pirates$$ nec recusaturum Tiridaten accipiendo diademati in urbem venire ,  nisi sacerdotii religione attineretur 
 When Paetus returned and dreaded something worse , the emperor thought it enough to reproach him with a jest , to the effect that he pardoned him at once , lest one so ready to take fright might sink under prolonged suspense$$  iturum ad signa et effigies principis ,  ubi legionibus coram regnum auspicaretur
 Talibus Vologaesis litteris , qui Paetus diversa tamquam rebus integris scribebat , interrogatus centurio , qui cum legatis advenerat , quo in statu Armenia esset , omnes inde Romanos excessisse respondit$$ Inter quae veris principio legati Parthorum mandata regis Vologaesis litterasque in eandem formam attulere

 tum lustratum rite exercitum ad contionem vocat orditurque magnifica de auspiciis imperatoris rebusque a se gestis , adversa in inscitiam Paeti declinans , multa acutoritate , quae viro militari pro facundia erat$$ Then ,  after the due lustration of his army ,  he called them together for an harangue ,  and began with grand allusions to the imperial auspices ,  and to his own achievements ,  while he attributed their disasters to the incapacity of Paetus He spoke with much impressiveness ,  which in him ,  as a military man ,  was as good as eloquence
 Mox iter Lucius Lucullo quondam penetratum , apertis quae vetustas obsaepserat , pergit$$ He then pursued the route opened up in former days by Lucius Lucullus ,  clearing away the obstructions of long years
 et venientes Tiridatis Bologaesisque de pace legatos haud aspernatus , adiungit iis centuriones cum mandatis non immitibus$$ Envoys who came to him from Tiridates and Vologeses about peace ,  he did not repulse ,  but sent back with them some centurions with a message anything but harsh

 et saepe , dum in tergum respectant , lateribus aut fronte circumveniebantur , vel si in proxima evaserant , illis quoque igni correptis , etiam quae longinqua crediderant in eodem casu reperiebant$$ Often ,  while they looked behind them ,  they were intercepted by flames on their side or in their face Or if they reached a refuge close at hand ,  when this too was seized by the fire ,  they found that ,  even places ,  which they had imagined to be remote ,  were involved in the same calamity
 postremo , quid vitarent quid peterent ambigui , complere vias , sterni per agros quidam amissis omnibus fortunis , diurni quoque victus , alii caritate suorum , quos eripere nequiverant , quamvis patente effugio interiere$$ At last ,  doubting what they should avoid or whither betake themselves ,  they crowded the streets or flung themselves down in the fields ,  while some who had lost their all ,  even their very daily bread ,  and others out of love for their kinsfolk ,  whom they had been unable to rescue ,  perished ,  though escape was open to them
 nec quisquam defendere audebat , crebris multorum minis restinguere prohibentium , et quia alii palam facies iaciebant atque esse sibi auctorem vociferabantur , sive ut raptus licentius exercerent seu iussu$$ And no one dared to stop the mischief ,  because of incessant menaces from a number of persons who forbade the extinguishing of the flames ,  because again others openly hurled brands ,  and kept shouting that there was one who gave them authority ,  either seeking to plunder more freely ,  or obeying orders
 Sexto demum die apud imas Esquilias finis incendio factus , prorutis per immensum aedificiis , ut continuae violentiae campus et velut vacuum caelum occurreret$$ At last ,  after five days ,  an end was put to the conflagration at the foot of the Esquiline hill ,  by the destruction of all buildings on a vast space ,  so that the violence of the fire was met by clear ground and an open sky
 necdum positus metus aut redierat plebi spes rursum grassatus ignis , patulis magis urbis locis$$ But before people had laid aside their fears ,  the flames returned ,  with no less fury this second time ,  and especially in the spacious districts of the city
 eoque strages hominum minor delubra deum et porticus amoenitati dicatae latius procidere$$ Consequently ,  though there was less loss of life ,  the temples of the gods ,  and the porticoes which were devoted to enjoyment ,  fell in a yet more widespread ruin
 plusque infamiae id incendium habuit , quia praediis Tigellini Aemilianis proruperat videbaturque Nero condendae urbis novae et cognomento suo appellandae gloriam quaerere$$ And to this conflagration there attached the greater infamy because it broke out on the Aemilian property of Tigellinus ,  and it seemed that Nero was aiming at the glory of founding a new city and calling it by his name
 quippe in regiones quattuordecim Romam dividitur , quarum quattuor integrae manebant , tres solo tenus deiectae , septem reliquis pauca tectorum vestigia supererant , lacera et semusta$$ Rome ,  indeed ,  is divided into fourteen districts ,  four of which remained uninjured ,  three were levelled to the ground ,  while in the other seven were left only a few shattered ,  half-burnt relics of houses
 Ceterum Nero usus est patriae ruinis exstruxitque domum , in qua haud proinde gemmae et aurum miraculo essent , solita pridem et luxu vulgata , quam arva et stagna et in modum solitudinem hinc silvae , inde aperta spatia et prospetus , magistris et machinatoribus Severo et Celere , quibus ingenium et audacia erat etiam , quae natura denegavisset , per artem temptare et viribus principis inludere$$ Nero meanwhile availed himself of his country's desolation ,  and erected a mansion in which the jewels and gold ,  long familiar objects ,  quite vulgarised by our extravagance ,  were not so marvellous as the fields and lakes ,  with woods on one side to resemble a wilderness ,  and ,  on the other ,  open spaces and extensive views The directors and contrivers of the work were Severus and Celer ,  who had the genius and the audacity to attempt by art even what nature had refused ,  and to fool away an emperor's resources
 namque ab lacu Averno navigabilem fossam usque ad ostia Tibernia depressuros promiserant squalenti litore aut per montes adversos neque enim aliud umidum gignendis aquis occirrit quam Pomptinae paludes$$ They had actually undertaken to sink a navigable canal from the lake Avernus to the mouths of the Tiber along a barren shore or through the face of hills ,  where one meets with no moisture which could supply water ,  except the Pomptine marshes
 cetera abrupta aut arentia , ac si perrumpi possent , intolerandus labor nec satis causae$$ The rest of the country is broken rock and perfectly dry Even if it could be cut through ,  the labour would be intolerable ,  and there would be no adequate result
 Nero tamen , ut erat incredibilium cupitor , effodere proxima Averno iuga conisus est , manentque vestigia inritae spei$$ Nero ,  however ,  with his love of the impossible ,  endeavoured to dig through the nearest hills to Avernus ,  and there still remain the traces of his disappointed hope
 Ceterum urbis quae domui supererant non , ut post Gallica incendia , nulla distinctione nec passim erecta , sed dimensis vicorum ordinibus et latis viarum spatiis cohibitaque aedificiorum altitudine ac patefactis areis additisque porticibus , quae frontem insularum protegerent$$ Of Rome meanwhile ,  so much as was left unoccupied by his mansion ,  was not built up ,  as it had been after its burning by the Gauls ,  without any regularity or in any fashion ,  but with rows of streets according to measurement ,  with broad thoroughfares ,  with a restriction on the height of houses ,  with open spaces ,  and the further addition of colonnades ,  as a protection to the frontage of the blocks of tenements
 eas proticus Nero sua pecunia exstructurum purgatasque areas dominis traditurum pollicitus est$$ These colonnades Nero promised to erect at his own expense ,  and to hand over the open spaces ,  when cleared of the debris ,  to the ground landlords
 addidit praemia pro cuiusque ordine et rei familiaris copiis , finivitque tempus , intra quod effectis domibus aut insulis apiscerentur$$ He also offered rewards proportioned to each person's position and property ,  and prescribed a period within which they were to obtain them on the completion of so many houses or blocks of building
 ruderi accipiendo Ostienses paludes destinabat , utique naves , quae frumentum Tiberi subvectavissent , onustae rudere decurrerent , aedificiaque ipsa certa sui parte sine trabibus saxo Gabino Albanove solidarentur , quod is lapis ignibus impervius est$$ He fixed on the marshes of Ostia for the reception of the rubbish ,  and arranged that the ships which had brought up corn by the Tiber ,  should sail down the river with cargoes of this rubbish The buildings themselves ,  to a certain height ,  were to be solidly constructed ,  without wooden beams ,  of stone from Gabii or Alba ,  that material being impervious to fire
 iam aqua privatorum licentia intercepta quo largior et pluribus locis in publicum flueret , custodes et subsidia reprimendis ignibus in propatulo quisque haberet$$ And to provide that the water which individual license had illegally appropriated ,  might flow in greater abundance in several places for the public use ,  officers were appointed ,  and everyone was to have in the open court the means of stopping a fire
 nec communione parietum , sed propriis quaeque muris ambirentur$$ Every building ,  too ,  was to be enclosed by its own proper wall ,  not by one common to others
 ea ex utilitate accepta decorem quoque novae urbi attulere$$ These changes which were liked for their utility ,  also added beauty to the new city
 erant tamen qui crederent veterem illam formam salubritati magis conduxisse , quoniam angustiae itinerum et altitudo tectorum non perinde solis vapore perrumperentur$$ Some ,  however ,  thought that its old arrangement had been more conducive to health ,  inasmuch as the narrow streets with the elevation of the roofs were not equally penetrated by the sun's heat ,  while now the open space ,  unsheltered by any shade ,  was scorched by a fiercer glow
 Et haec quidem humanis consiliis providebantur$$ Such indeed were the precautions of human wisdom
 mox petita a dis piacula aditique Sibyllae libri , ex quibus supplicatum Volcano et Cereri Proserpinaeque , ac propitiata Iuno per matronas , primum in Capitolio , deinde apud proximum mare , unde hausta aqua templum et simulacrum deae perspersum est$$ The next thing was to seek means of propitiating the gods ,  and recourse was had to the Sibylline books ,  by the direction of which prayers were offered to Vulcanus ,  Ceres ,  and Proserpina Juno ,  too ,  was entreated by the matrons ,  first ,  in the Capitol ,  then on the nearest part of the coast ,  whence water was procured to sprinkle the fane and image of the goddess
 et sellisternia ac pervigilia celebravere feminae , quibus mariti erant$$ And there were sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women
 Sed non ope humana , non largitionibus principis aut deum placamentis decedebat infamia , quin iussum incendium crederetur$$ But all human efforts ,  all the lavish gifts of the emperor ,  and the propitiations of the gods ,  did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order
 ergo abolendo rumori Nero subdidit reos et quaesitissimis poenis adfecit , quos per flagitia invisos vulgus Chrestianos appellabat$$ Consequently ,  to get rid of the report ,  Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations ,  called Christians by the populace
 auctor nominis eius Christus Tibero imperitante per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum supplicio adfectus erat repressaque in praesens exitiablilis superstitio rursum erumpebat , non modo per Iudaeam , originem eius mali , sed per urbem etiam , quo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt celebranturque$$ Christus ,  from whom the name had its origin ,  suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators ,  Pontius Pilatus ,  and a most mischievous superstition ,  thus checked for the moment ,  again broke out not only in Judaea ,  the first source of the evil ,  but even in Rome ,  where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular
 igitur primum correpti qui fatebantur , deinde indicio eorum multitudo ingens haud proinde in crimine incendii quam odio humani generis convicti sunt$$ Accordingly ,  an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty then ,  upon their information ,  an immense multitude was convicted ,  not so much of the crime of firing the city ,  as of hatred against mankind
 et pereuntibus addita ludibria , ut ferarum tergis contecti laniatu canum interirent aut crucibus adfixi aut flammandi atque , ubi defecisset dies , in usum nocturni luminis urerentur$$ Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths Covered with the skins of beasts ,  they were torn by dogs and perished ,  or were nailed to crosses ,  or were doomed to the flames and burnt ,  to serve as a nightly illumination ,  when daylight had expired
 hortos suos ei spectaculo Nero obtulerat , et circense ludicrum edebat , habitu aurigae permixtus plebi vel curriculo insistens$$ Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle ,  and was exhibiting a show in the circus ,  while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car
 unde quamquam adversus sontes et novissima exempla meritos miseratio oriebatur , tamquam non utilitate publica , sed in saevitiam unius absumerentur$$ Hence ,  even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment ,  there arose a feeling of compassion
 Interea conferendis pecuniis pervastata Italia , provinciae eversae sociique populi et quae civitatium liberae vocantur$$ Meanwhile Italy was thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money ,  the provinces were ruined ,  as also the allied nations and the free states ,  as they were called
 inque eam praedam etiam dii cessere , spoliatis in urbe templis egestoque auro , quod triumphis , quod votis omnis populi Romani aetas prospere aut in metu sacraverat$$ Even the gods fell victims to the plunder for the temples in Rome were despoiled and the gold carried off ,  which ,  for a triumph or a vow ,  the Roman people in every age had consecrated in their prosperity or their alarm
 enimvero per Asiam atque Achaiam non dona tantum , sed simulacra numinum abripiebatur , missis in eas provincias Acrato et Secundo Carrinate$$ Throughout Asia and Achaia not only votive gifts ,  but the images of deities were seized ,  Acratus and Secundus Carinas having been sent into those provinces
 ille libertus cuicumque flagitio promptus , hic Graeca doctrina ore tenus exercitus animum bonis artibus non imbuerat$$ The first was a freedman ready for any wickedness the latter ,  as far as speech went ,  was thoroughly trained in Greek learning ,  but he had not imbued his heart with sound principles
 ferebatur Seneca , quo invidiam sacrilegii a semet averteret , longinqui ruris secessum oravisse , et postquam non concedebatur , ficta valetudine , quasi aeger nervis , cubiculum non egressus$$ Seneca ,  it was said ,  to avert from himself the obloquy of sacrilege ,  begged for the seclusion of a remote rural retreat ,  and ,  when it was refused ,  feigning ill health ,  as though he had a nervous ailment ,  would not quit his chamber
 tradidere quidam venenum ei per libertum ipsius , cui nomen Cleonicus , paratum iussu Neronis vitatumque a Seneca proditione liberti seu propria formidine , dum per simplicem victum et agrestibus pomis , ac si sitis admoneret , profluente aqua vitam tolerat$$ According to some writers ,  poison was prepared for him at Nero's command by his own freedman ,  whose name was Cleonicus This Seneca avoided through the freedman's disclosure ,  or his own apprehension ,  while he used to support life on the very simple diet of wild fruits ,  with water from a running stream when thirst prompted
 Ergo dum scelera principis , et finem adesse imperio diligendumque , qui fessis rebus succurreret , inter se aut inter amicos iaciunt , adgregavere Claudium Senecionem , Cervarium Proculum , Vulcacium Araricum , Iulium Augurinum , Munatium Gratum , Antonium Natalem , Marcium Festum , equites Romanos$$ So ,  while they dropped hints among themselves or among their friends about the emperor's crimes ,  the approaching end of empire ,  and the importance of choosing some one to rescue the State in its distress ,  they associated with them Tullius Senecio ,  Cervarius Proculus ,  Vulcatius Araricus ,  Julius Augurinus ,  Munatius Gratus ,  Antonius Natalis ,  and Marcius Festus ,  all Roman knights
 ex quibus Senecio , e praecipua familiaritate Neronis , speciem amicitiae etiam tum retinens eo pluribus periculis conflictabatur$$ Of these Senecio ,  one of those who was specially intimate with Nero ,  still kept up a show of friendship ,  and had consequently to struggle with all the more dangers
 Natalis particeps ad omne secretum Pisoni erat$$ Natalis shared with Piso all his secret plans
 ceteris spes ex novis rebus petebatur$$ The rest built their hopes on revolution
 adscitae sunt super Subrium et Sulpicium , de quibus rettuli , militares manus Gavius silvanus et Statius Proxumus tribuni cohortium praetoriarum , Maximus Scaurus et Venetus Paulus centuriones$$ Besides Subrius and Sulpicius ,  whom I have already mentioned ,  they invited the aid of military strength ,  of Gavius Silvanus and Statius Proximus ,  tribunes of praetorian cohorts ,  and of two centurions ,  Maximus Scaurus and Venetus Paulus
 sed summum robur in Faenio Rufo praefecto videbatur , quem vita famaque laudatum per saevitiam impudicitiamque Tigellinus in animo principis anteibat , fatigabatque criminationibus ac saepe in metum adduxerat quasi adulterum Agrippinae et desiderio eius ultioni intentum$$ But their mainstay ,  it was thought ,  was Faenius Rufus ,  the commander of the guard ,  a man of esteemed life and character ,  to whom Tigellinus with his brutality and shamelessness was superior in the emperor's regard He harassed him with calumnies ,  and had often put him in terror by hinting that he had been Agrippina's paramour ,  and from sorrow at her loss was intent on vengeance
 igitur ubi coniuratis praefectum quoque praetorii in partes descendisse crebro ipsius sermone facta fides , promptius iam de tempore ac loco caedis agitabant$$ And so ,  when the conspirators were assured by his own repeated language that the commander of the praetorian guard had come over to their side ,  they once more eagerly discussed the time and place of the fatal deed
 et cepisse impetum Subrius Flavus ferebatur in scaena canentem Neronem adgrediendi , aut cum ardente domo per noctem huc illuc cursaret incustoditus$$ It was said that Subrius Flavus had formed a sudden resolution to attack Nero when singing on the stage ,  or when his house was in flames and he was running hither and thither ,  unattended ,  in the darkness
 hic occasio solitudinis , ibi ipsa frequentia tanti decoris testis pulcherrima animum exstimulaverunt , nisi impunitatis cupido retinuisset , magnis semper conatibus adversa$$ In the one case was the opportunity of solitude in the other ,  the very crowd which would witness so glorious a deed ,  had roused a singularly noble soul
 Interim cunctantibus prolatantibusque spem ac metum Epicharis quaedam , incertum quonam modo sciscitata (neque illi ante ulla rerum honestarum cura fuerat) , accendere et arguere coniuratos$$ Meanwhile ,  as they hesitated in prolonged suspense between hope and fear ,  a certain Epicharis (how she informed herself is uncertain ,  as she had never before had a thought of anything noble) began to stir and upbraid the conspirators
 ac postremum lentitudinis eorum pertaesa et in Campania agens primores classiariorum Misenensium labefacere et conscientia inligare conisa est tali initio$$ Wearied at last of their long delay ,  she endeavoured ,  when staying in Campania ,  to shake the loyalty of the officers of the fleet at Misenum ,  and to entangle them in a guilty complicity
 erat nauarchus in ea classe Volusius Proculus , occidendae matris Neroni inter ministros , non ex magnitudine sceleris provectus , ut rebatur$$ She began thus There was a captain in the fleet ,  Volusius Proculus ,  who had been one of Nero's instruments in his mother's murder ,  and had not ,  as he thought ,  been promoted in proportion to the greatness of his crime
 is mulieri olim cognitus , seu recens orta amicitia , dum merita erga Neronem sua et quam in inritum cecidissent aperit adicitque questus et destinationem vindictae , si facultas oreretur , spem dedit posse impelli et plures conciliare$$ Either ,  as an old acquaintance of the woman ,  or on the strength of a recent intimacy ,  he divulged to her his services to Nero and their barren result to himself ,  adding complaints ,  and his determination to have vengeance ,  should the chance arise
 nec leve auxilium in classe , crebras occasiones , quia Nero multo apud Puteolos et Misenum maris usu laetabatur$$ He thus inspired the hope that he could be persuaded ,  and could secure many others
 ergo Epicharis plura et omnia scelera principis orditur , neque sancti quidquam manere$$ No small help was to be found in the fleet ,  and there would be numerous opportunities ,  as Nero delighted in frequent enjoyment of the sea off Puteoli and Misenum
 sed provisum , quonam modo poenas eversae rei publicae daret$$ Epicharis accordingly said more ,  and began the history of all the emperor's crimes
 accingeretur modo navare operam et militum acerrimos ducere in partes , ac digna pretia exspectaret$$ The Senate ,  she affirmed ,  had no power left it
 nomina tamen coniuratorum reticuit$$ yet means had been provided whereby he might pay the penalty of having destroyed the State
 unde Proculi indicium inritum fuit , quamvis ea , quae audierat , ad Neronem detulisset$$ Only let Proculus gird himself to do his part and bring over to their side his bravest soldiers ,  and then look for an adequate recompense
 accita quippe Epicharis et cum indice composita nullis testibus innisum facile confutavit$$ The conspirators' names ,  however ,  she withheld
 sed ipsa in custodia retenta est , suspectante Nerone haud falsa esse etiam quae vera non probabantur$$ Consequently the information of Proculus was useless ,  even though he reported what he had heard to Nero
 Igitur coepta luce Milichus in hortos Servilianos pergit et cum foribus arceretur , magna et atrocia adferre dictitans deductusque ab ianitoribus ad libertum Neronis Epaphroditum , mox ab eo ad Neronem , urgens periculum , graves coniuratos et cetera , quae audiverat coniectaverat , docet telum quoque in necem eius paratum ostendit accirique reum iussit$$ Accordingly at daybreak Milichus went to the Servilian gardens ,  and ,  finding the doors shut against him ,  said again and again that he was the bearer of important and alarming news Upon this he was conducted by the gatekeepers to one of Nero's freedmen ,  Epaphroditus ,  and by him to Nero ,  whom he informed of the urgent danger ,  of the formidable conspiracy ,  and of all else which he had heard or inferred
 is raptus per milites et defensionem orsus , ferrum , cuius argueretur , olim religione patria cultum et in cubiculo habitum ac fraude liberti subreptum respondit tabulas testamenti saepius a se et incustodia dierum observatione signatas pecunias et libertates servis et ante dono datas , sed ideo tunc largius , quia tenui iam re familiari et instantibus creditoribus testamento diffideret enimvero liberales semper epulas struxisse , dum ageret vitam amoenam et duris iudicibus parum probatam fomenta vulneribus nulla iussu suo , sed quia cetera palam vana obiecisset , adiungere crimen , cuius se pariter indicem et testem faceret$$ He showed him too the weapon prepared for his destruction ,  and bade him summon the accused Scaevinus on being arrested by the soldiers began his defence with the reply that the dagger about which he was accused ,  had of old been regarded with a religious sentiment by his ancestors ,  that it had been kept in his chamber ,  and been stolen by a trick of his freedman He had often ,  he said ,  signed his will without heeding the observance of particular days ,  and had previously given presents of money as well as freedom to some of his slaves ,  only on this occasion he gave more freely ,  because ,  as his means were now impoverished and his creditors were pressing him ,  he distrusted the validity of his will
 adicit dictis constantiam incusat ultro intestabilem et consceleratum , tanta vocis ac vultus securitate , ut labaret indicium , nisi Milichum uxor admonuisset Antonium Natalem multa cum Scaevino ac secreta collocutum et esse utrosque Gaius Pisonis intimos$$ Certainly his table had always been profusely furnished ,  and his life luxurious ,  such as rigid censors would hardly approve As to the bandages for wounds ,  none had been prepared at his order ,  but as all the man's other charges were absurd ,  he added an accusation in which he might make himself alike informer and witness
 Ergo accitur Natalis , et diversi interrogantur , quisnam is sermo , qua de re fuisset tum exorta suspicio , quia non congruentia responderant , inditaque vincla et tormentorum adspectum ac minas non tulere$$ He backed up his words by an air of resolution Turning on his accuser ,  he denounced him as an infamous and depraved wretch ,  with so fearless a voice and look that the information was beginning to collapse ,  when Milichus was reminded by his wife that Antonious Natalis had had a long secret conversation with Scaevinus ,  and that both were Piso's intimate friends
 prior tamen Natalis , totius conspirationis magis gnarus , simul arguendi peritior , de Pisone primum fatetur , deinde adicit Annaeum Senecam , sive internuntius inter eum Pisonemque fuit , sive ut Neronis gratiam pararet , qui infensus Senecae omnes ad eum opprimendum artes conquirebat tum cognito Natalis indicio Scaevinus quoque pari imbecillitate , an cuncta iam patefacta credens nec ullum silentii emolumentum , edidit ceteros ex quibus Lucanus Quintianusque et Senecio diu abnuere$$ Natalis was therefore summoned ,  and they were separately asked what the conversation was ,  and what was its subject Then a suspicion arose because their answers did not agree ,  and they were both put in irons They could not endure the sight and the threat of torture Natalis however ,  taking the initiative ,  knowing as he did more of the whole conspiracy ,  and being also more practised in accusing ,  first confessed about Piso ,  next added the name of Annaeus Seneca ,  either as having been a messenger between him and Piso ,  or to win the favour of Nero ,  who hated Seneca and sought every means for his ruin Then Scaevinus too ,  when he knew the disclosure of Natalis ,  with like pusillanimity ,  or under the impression that everything now divulged ,  and that there could be no advantage in silence ,  revealed the other conspirators
 post promissa impunitate corrupti , quo tarditatem excusarent , Lucanus Aciliam matrem suam , Quintianus Glitium Gallum , Senecio Annium Pollionem , amicorum praecipuos , nominavere$$ Of these ,  Lucanus ,  Quintianus ,  and Senecio long persisted in denial after a time ,  when bribed by the promise of impunity ,  anxious to excuse their reluctance ,  Lucanus named his mother Atilla ,  Quintianus and Senecio ,  their chief friends ,  respectively ,  Glitius Gallus and Annius Pollio
 Atque interim Nero recordatus Volusii Proculi indico Epicharin attineri ratusque muliebre corpus impar dolori tormentis dilacerari iubet$$ Nero ,  meanwhile ,  remembering that Epicharis was in custody on the information of Volusius Proculus ,  and assuming that a woman's frame must be unequal to the agony ,  ordered her to be torn on the rack
 at illam non verbera , non ignes , non ira eo acrius torquentium , ne a femina spernerentur , pervicere , quin obiecta denegaret$$ But neither the scourge nor fire ,  nor the fury of the men as they increased the torture that they might not be a woman's scorn ,  overcame her positive denial of the charge
 sic primus quaestionis dies contemptus$$ Thus the first day's inquiry was futile
 postero cum ad eosdem cruciatus retraheretur gestamine sellae (nam dissolutis membris insistere nequibat) , vinclo fasciae , quam pectori detraxerat , in modum laquei ad arcum sellae restricto indidit cervicem et corporis pondere conisa tenuem iam spiritum expressit , clariore exemplo libertina mulier in tanta necessitate alienos ac prope ignotos protegendo , cum ingenui et viri et equites Romani senatoresque intacti tormentis carissima suorum quisque pignorum proderent$$ On the morrow ,  as she was being dragged back on a chair to the same torments (for with her limbs all dislocated she could not stand) ,  she tied a band ,  which she had stript off her bosom ,  in a sort of noose to the arched back of the chair ,  put her neck in it ,  and then straining with the whole weight of her body ,  wrung out of her frame its little remaining breath All the nobler was the example set by a freedwoman at such a crisis in screening strangers and those whom she hardly knew ,  when freeborn men ,  Roman knights ,  and senators ,  yet unscathed by torture ,  betrayed ,  every one ,  his dearest kinsfolk For even Lucanus and Senecio and Quintianus failed not to reveal their accomplices indiscriminately ,  and Nero was more and more alarmed ,  though he had fenced his person with a largely augmented guard
 Non enim omittebant Lucanus quoque et Senecio et Quintianus passim conscios edere , magis magisque pavido Nerone , quamquam multiplicatis excubiis semet saepsisset$$ Even Rome itself he put ,  so to say ,  under custody ,  garrisoning its walls with companies of soldiers and occupying with troops the coast and the river-banks
 quin et urbem per manipulos occupatis moenibus , insesso etiam mari et amne , velut in custodiam dedit volitabantque per fora , per domos , rura quoque et proxima municipiorum pedites equitesque , permixti Germanis , quibus fidebat princeps quasi externis$$ Incessantly were there flying through the public places ,  through private houses ,  country fields ,  and the neighbouring villages ,  horse and foot soldiers ,  mixed with Germans ,  whom the emperor trusted as being foreigners In long succession ,  troops of prisoners in chains were dragged along and stood at the gates of his gardens
 continua hinc et vincta agmina trahi ac foribus hortorum adiacere atque ubi dicendam ad causam introissent , non studia tantum erga coniuratos , sed fortuitus sermo et subiti occursus , si convivium , si spectaculum simul inissent , pro crimine accipi , cum super Neronis ac Tigellini saevas percunctationes Faenius quoque Rufus violenter urgueret , nondum ab indicibus nominatus et quo fidem inscitiae pararet , atrox adversus socios$$ When they entered to plead their cause ,  a smile of joy on any of the conspirators ,  a casual conversation ,  a sudden meeting ,  or the fact of having entered a banquet or a public show in company ,  was construed into a crime ,  while to the savage questionings of Nero and Tigellinus were added the violent menaces of Faenius Rufus ,  who had not yet been named by the informers ,  but who ,  to get the credit of complete ignorance ,  frowned fiercely on his accomplices
 idem Subrio Flavo adsistenti adnuentique , an inter ipsam cognitionem destringeret gladium caedemque patraret , renuit infregitque impetum iam manum ad capulum referentis$$ When Subius Flavus at his side asked him by a sign whether he should draw his sword in the middle of the trial and perpetrate the fatal deed ,  Rufus refused ,  and checked the man's impulse as he was putting his hand to his sword-hilt
 Fuere qui prodita coniuratione , dum auditur Milichus , dum dubitat Scaevinus , hortarentur Pisonem pergere in castra aut rostra escendere studiaque militum et populi temptare$$ Some there were who ,  as soon as the conspiracy was betrayed ,  urged Piso ,  while Milichus' story was being heard ,  and Scaevinus was hesitating ,  to go to the camp or mount the Rostra and test the feelings of the soldiers and of the people
 si conatibus eius conscii adgregarentur , secuturos etiam integros magnamque motae rei famam , quae plurimum in novis consiliis valeret$$ If ,  said they ,  your accomplices join your enterprise ,  those also who are yet undecided ,  will follow ,  and great will be the fame of the movement once started ,  and this in any new scheme is all-powerful
 nihil adversum haec Neroni provisum$$ Against it Nero has taken no precaution
 etaim fortes viros subitis terreri , nedum ille scaenicus , Tigellino scilicet cum paelicibus suis comitante , arma contra cieret$$ Even brave men are dismayed by sudden perils far less will that stageplayer ,  with Tigellinus forsooth and his concubines in his train ,  raise arms against you
 multa experiendo confieri , quae segnibus ardua videantur$$ Many things are accomplished on trial which cowards think arduous
 frustra silentium et fidem in tot consciorum animis et corporibus sperare$$ It is vain to expect secrecy and fidelity from the varying tempers and bodily constitutions of such a host of accomplices
 cruciatui aut praemio cuncta pervia esse$$ Torture or reward can overcome everything
 venturos qui ipsum quoque vincirent , postremo indigna nece adficerent$$ Men will soon come to put you also in chains and inflict on you an ignominious death
 quanto laudabilius periturum , dum amplectitur rem publicam , dum auxilia libertati invocat! miles potius deesset et plebes desereret , dum ipse maioribus , dum posteris , si vita praeriperetur , mortem adprobaret$$ How much more gloriously will you die while you cling to the State and invoke aid for liberty Rather let the soldiers fail ,  the people be traitors ,  provided that you ,  if prematurely robbed of life ,  justify your death to your ancestors and descendants
 immotus his et paululum in publico versatus , post domi secretus animum adversum suprema firmabat , donec manus militum adveniret , quos Nero tirones aut stipendiis recentes delegerat nam vetus miles timebatur tamquam favore imbutus$$ Unmoved by these considerations ,  Piso showed himself a few moments in public ,  then sought the retirement of his house ,  and there fortified his spirit against the worst ,  till a troop of soldiers arrived ,  raw recruits ,  or men recently enlisted ,  whom Nero had selected ,  because he was afraid of the veterans ,  imbued ,  though they were ,  with a liking for him
 obiit abruptis brachiorum venis$$ Piso expired by having the veins in his arms severed
 testamentum foedis adversus Neronem adulationibus amori uxoris dedit , quam degenerem et sola corporis forma commendatam amici matrimonio abstulerat$$ His will ,  full of loathsome flatteries of Nero ,  was a concession to his love of his wife ,  a base woman ,  with only a beautiful person to recommend her ,  whom he had taken away from her husband ,  one of his friends
 nomen mulieri Satria Galla , priori marito Domitius Silus$$ Her name was Atria Galla
 hic patientia , illa impudica Pisonis infamiam propagavere$$ that of her former husband ,  Domitius Silus
 Proximam necem Plautii Laterani consulis designati Nero adiungit , adeo propere , ut non complect liberos , non illud breve mortis arbitrium permitteret$$ In quick succession Nero added the murder of Plautius Lateranus ,  consul-elect ,  so promptly that he did not allow him to embrace his children or to have the brief choice of his own death
 raptus in locum servilibus poenis sepositum manu Statii tribuni trucidatur , plenus constantis silentii nec tribuno obiciens eandem conscientiam$$ He was dragged off to a place set apart for the execution of slaves ,  and butchered by the hand of the tribune Statius ,  maintaining a resolute silence ,  and not reproaching the tribune with complicity in the plot
 Sequitur caedes Annaei Senecae , laetissima principi , non quia coniurationis manifestum compererat , sed ut ferro grassaretur , quando venenum non processerat$$ Then followed the destruction of Annaeus Seneca ,  a special joy to the emperor ,  not because he had convicted him of the conspiracy ,  but anxious to accomplish with the sword what poison had failed to do
 solus quippe Natalis et hactenus prompsit , missum se ad aegrotum Senecam , uti viseret conquerereturque , cur Pisonem aditu arceret melius fore , si amicitiam familiari congressu exercuissent$$ It was ,  in fact ,  Natalis alone who divulged Seneca's name ,  to this extent ,  that he had been sent to Seneca when ailing ,  to see him and remonstrate with him for excluding Piso from his presence ,  when it would have been better to have kept up their friendship by familiar intercourse
 et respondisse Senecam sermone mutuos et crebra conloquia neutri conducere$$ that Seneca's reply was that mutual conversations and frequent interviews were to the advantage of neither ,  but still that his own life depended on Piso's safety
 ceterum salutem suam incolumitate Pisonis inniti haec ferre Gavius Silvanus tribunus praetoriae cohortis , et an dicta Natalis suaque responsa nosceret percunctari Senecam iubetur$$ Gavius Silvanus ,  tribune of a praetorian cohort ,  was ordered to report this to Seneca and to ask him whether he acknowledged what Natalis said and his own answer
 is forte an prudens ad eum diem ex Campania remeaverat quartumque apud lapidem suburbano rure substiterat$$ Either by chance or purposely Seneca had returned on that day from Campania ,  and had stopped at a countryhouse four miles from Rome
 illo propinqua vespera tribunus venit et villam globis militum saepsit tum ipsi cum Pompeia Paulina uxore et amicis duobus epulanti mandata imperatoris edidit$$ Thither the tribune came next evening ,  surrounded the house with troops of soldiers ,  and then made known the emperor's message to Seneca as he was at dinner with his wife ,  Pompeia Paulina ,  and two friends
 Seneca missum ad se Natalem conquestumque nomine Pisonis , quod a visendo eo prohiberetur , seque rationem valetudinis et amorem quietis excusavisse respondit$$ Seneca replied that Natalis had been sent to him and had complained to him in Piso's name because of his refusal to see Piso ,  upon which he excused himself on the ground of failing health and the desire of rest
 cur salutem privati hominis incolumitati suae anteferret , causam non habuisse$$ He had no reason ,  he said ,  for preferring the interest of any private citizen to his own safety ,  and he had no natural aptitude for flattery
 nec sibi promptum in adulationes ingenium$$ No one knew this better than Nero ,  who had oftener experienced Seneca's freespokenness than his servility
 idque nulli magis gnarum quam Neroni , qui saepius libertatem Senecae quam servitium expertus esset$$ When the tribune reported this answer in the presence of Poppaea and Tigellinus ,  the emperor's most confidential advisers in his moments of rage ,  he asked whether Seneca was meditating suicide
 ubi haec a tribuno relata sunit Poppaea et Tigellino coram , quod erat saevienti principi intimum consiliorum , interrogat an Seneca voluntariam mortem pararet$$ Upon this the tribune asserted that he saw no signs of fear ,  and perceived no sadness in his words or in his looks He was accordingly ordered to go back and to announce sentence of death
 tum tribunus nulla pavoris signa , nihil triste in verbis eius aut vultu deprensum confirmavit ergo regredi et indicere mortem iubetur tradit Fabius Rusticus non eo quo venerat intinere redisse tribunum , sed flexisse ad Faenium praefectum et expositis Caesaris iussis an obtemperaret interrogavisse , monitumque ab eo ut exsequeretur , fatali omnium ignavia$$ Fabius Rusticus tells us that he did not return the way he came ,  but went out of his course to Faenius ,  the commander of the guard ,  and having explained to him the emperor's orders ,  and asked whether he was to obey them ,  was by him admonished to carry them out ,  for a fatal spell of cowardice was on them all For this very Silvanus was one of the conspirators ,  and he was now abetting the crimes which he had united with them to avenge
 nam et Silvanus inter coniuratos erat augebatque scelera , in quorum ultionem consenserat$$ But he spared himself the anguish of a word or of a look ,  and merely sent in to Seneca one of his centurions ,  who was to announce to him his last doom
 Ubi haec atque talia velut in commune disseruit , complectitur uxorem , et paululum adversus praesentem fortitudinem mollitus rogat oratque temperaret dolori neu aeternum susciperet , sed in contemplatione vitae per virtutem actae desiderium mariti solaciis honestis toleraret$$ Having spoken these and like words ,  meant ,  so to say ,  for all ,  he embraced his wife then softening awhile from the stern resolution of the hour ,  he begged and implored her to spare herself the burden of perpetual sorrow ,  and ,  in the contemplation of a life virtuously spent ,  to endure a husband's loss with honourable consolations
 illa contra sibi quoque destinatam mortem adseverat manumque percussoris exposcit$$ She declared ,  in answer ,  that she too had decided to die ,  and claimed for herself the blow of the executioner
 tum Seneca gloriae eius non adversus , simul amore , ne sibi unice dilectam ad iniurias relinqueret , vitae inquit delenimenta monstraveram tibi , tu mortis decus mavis$$ There upon Seneca ,  not to thwart her noble ambition ,  from an affection too which would not leave behind him for insult one whom he dearly loved ,  replied 
 non invidebo exemplo$$  I have shown you ways of smoothing life
 sit huius tam fortis exitus constantia penes utrosque par , claritudinis plus in tuo fine$$ you prefer the glory of dying I will not grudge you such a noble example
 post quae eodem ictu brachia ferro exsolvunt$$ Let the fortitude of so courageous an end be alike in both of us ,  but let there be more in your decease to win fame
 Seneca , quoniam senile corpus et parco victu tenuatum lenta effugia sanguini praebebat , crurum quoque et poplitum venas abrumpit$$ Then by one and the same stroke they sundered with a dagger the arteries of their arms Seneca ,  as his aged frame ,  attenuated by frugal diet ,  allowed the blood to escape but slowly ,  severed also the veins of his legs and knees
 saevisque cruciatibus defessus , ne dolore suo animum uxoris infringeret atque ipse visendo eius tormenta ad impatientiam delaberetur , suadet in aliud cubiculum abscedere$$ Worn out by cruel anguish ,  afraid too that his sufferings might break his wife's spirit ,  and that ,  as he looked on her tortures ,  he might himself sink into irresolution ,  he persuaded her to retire into another chamber
 et novissimo quoque momento suppeditante eloquentia advocatis scriptoribus pleraque tradidit , quae in vulgus edita eius verbis invertere supersedeo$$ Even at the last moment his eloquence failed him not he summoned his secretaries ,  and dictated much to them which ,  as it has been published for all readers in his own words ,  I forbear to paraphrase
 Fama fuit Subrium Flavum cum centurionibus occulto consilio , neque tamen ignorante Seneca , destinavisse , ut post occisum opera Pisonis Neronem Piso quoque interficeretur tradereturque imperium Senecae , quasi insonti et claritudine virtutum ad summum fastigium delecto$$ There was a rumour that Sabrius Flavus had held a secret consultation with the centurions ,  and had planned ,  not without Seneca's knowledge ,  that when Nero had been slain by Piso's instrumentality ,  Piso also was to be murdered ,  and the empire handed over to Seneca ,  as a man singled out for his splendid virtues by all persons of integrity
 quin et verba Flavi vulgabantur , non referre dedecori , si citharoedus demoveretur et tragoedus succederet (quia ut Nero cithara , ita Piso tragico ornatu canebat)$$ Even a saying of Flavus was popularly current ,  that it mattered not as to the disgrace if a harp-player were removed and a tragic actor succeeded him For as Nero used to sing to the harp ,  so did Piso in the dress of a tragedian
 Ceterum militaris quoque conspiratio non ultra fefellit , accensis quoque indicibus ad prodendum Faenium Rufum , quem eundem conscium et inquisitorem non tolerabant$$ The soldiers' part too in the conspiracy no longer escaped discovery ,  some in their rage becoming informers to betray Faenius Rufus ,  whom they could not endure to be both an accomplice and a judge
 ergo instanti minitantique renidens Scaevinus neminem ait plura scire quam ipsum , hortaturque ultro redderet tam bono principi vicem$$ Accordingly Scaevinus ,  in answer to his browbeating and menaces ,  said with a smile that no one knew more than he did ,  and actually urged him to show gratitude to so good a prince
 non vox adversum ea Faenio , non silentium , sed verba sua praepediens et pavoris manifestus , ceterisque ac maxime Cervario Proculo equite Romano ad convincendum eum conisis , iussu imperatoris a Cassio milite , qui ob insigne corporis robur adstabat , corripitur vinciturque$$ Faenius could not meet this with either speech or silence Halting in his words and visibly terror-stricken ,  while the rest ,  especially Cervarius Proculus ,  a Roman knight ,  did their utmost to convict him ,  he was ,  at the emperor's bidding ,  seized and bound by Cassius ,  a soldier ,  who because of his well-known strength of limb was in attendance
 Mox eorundem indicio Subrius Flavus tribunus pervertitur , primo dissimilitudinem morum ad defensionem trahens , neque se armatum cum inermibus et effeminatis tantum facinus consociaturum$$ Shortly afterwards ,  the information of the same men proved fatal to Subrius Flavus At first he grounded his defence on his moral contrast to the others ,  implying that an armed soldier ,  like himself ,  would never have shared such an attempt with unarmed and effeminate associates
 dein , postquam urgebatur , confessionis gloriam amplexus interrogatusque a Nerone , quibus causis ad oblivionem sacramenti processisset , oderam te , inquit$$ Then ,  when he was pressed ,  he embraced the glory of a full confession Questioned by Nero as to the motives which had led him on to forget his oath of allegiance ,  I hated you ,  he replied
 nec quisquam tibi fidelior militum fuit , dum amari meruisti$$ yet not a soldier was more loyal to you while you deserved to be loved
 odisse coepi , postquam parricida matris et uxoris , auriga et histrio et incendiarius extitisti$$ I began to hate you when you became the murderer of your mother and your wife ,  a charioteer ,  an actor ,  and an incendiary
 ipsa rettuli verba , quia non , ut Senecae , vulgata erant , nec minus nosci decebat militaris viri sensus incomptos et validos$$ I have given the man's very words ,  because they were not ,  like those of Seneca ,  generally published ,  though the rough and vigorous sentiments of a soldier ought to be no less known
 nihil in illa coniuratione gravius auribus Neronis accidisse constitit , qui ut faciendis sceleribus promptus , ita audiendi quae faceret insolens erat$$ Throughout the conspiracy nothing ,  it was certain ,  fell with more terror on the ears of Nero ,  who was as unused to be told of the crimes he perpetrated as he was eager in their perpetration
 poena Flavi Veianio Nigro tribuno mandatur$$ The punishment of Flavus was intrusted to Veianius Niger ,  a tribune
 is proximo in agro scrobem effodi iussit , quam Flavus ut humilem et angustam increpans , circumstantibus militibus , ne hoc quidem , inquit , ex disciplina$$ At his direction ,  a pit was dug in a neighbouring field Flavus ,  on seeing it ,  censured it as too shallow and confined ,  saying to the soldiers around him ,  Even this is not according to military rule
 admonitusque fortiter protendere cervicem , utinam , ait tu tam fortiter ferias! et ille multum tremens , cum vix duobus ictibus caput amputavisset , saevitiam apud Neronem iactavit , sesquiplaga interfectum a se dicendo$$ When bidden to offer his neck resolutely ,  I wish ,  said he ,  that your stroke may be as resolute The tribune trembled greatly ,  and having only just severed his head at two blows ,  vaunted his brutality to Nero ,  saying that he had slain him with a blow and a half
 Proximum constantiae exemplum Sulpicius Asper centurio praebuit , percunctanti Neroni , cur in caedam suam conspiravisset , breviter respondens non aliter tot flagitiis eius subveniri potuisse$$ Sulpicius Asper ,  a centurion ,  exhibited the next example of fortitude To Nero's question why he had conspired to murder him ,  he briefly replied that he could not have rendered a better service to his infamous career
 tum iussam poenam subiit$$ He then underwent the prescribed penalty
 nec ceteri centuriones in perpetiendis suppliciis degeneravere$$ Nor did the remaining centurions forget their courage in suffering their punishment
 at non Faenio Rufo par animus , sed lamentationes suas etiam in testamentum contulit$$ But Faenius Rufus had not equal spirit he even put his laments into his will
 Opperiebatur Nero , ut Vestinus quoque consul in crimen traheretur , violentum et infensum ratus , sed ex coniuratis consilia cum Vestino non miscuerant quidam vetustis in eum simultatibus , plures , quia praecipitem et insociabilem credebant$$ Nero waited in the hope that Vestinus also ,  the consul ,  whom he thought an impetuous and deeply disaffected man ,  would be involved in the charge None however of the conspirators had shared their counsels with him ,  some from old feuds against him ,  most because they considered him a reckless and dangerous associate
 ceterum Neroni odium adversus Vestinum ex intima sodalitate coeperat , dum hic ignaviam principis penitus dognitam despicit , ille ferociam amici metuit , saepe asperis facetiis inlusus , quae ubi multum ex vero traxere , acrem sui memoriam relinquunt$$ Nero's hatred of him had had its origin in intimate companionship ,  Vestinus seeing through and despising the emperor's cowardice ,  while Nero feared the high spirit of his friend ,  who often bantered him with that rough humour which ,  when it draws largely on facts ,  leaves a bitter memory behind it
 accesserat repens causa , quod Vestinus Statiliam Messalinam matrimonio sibi iunxerat , haud nescius inter adulteros eius et Caesarem esse$$ There was too a recent aggravation in the circumstance of Vestinus having married Statilia Messalina ,  without being ignorant that the emperor was one of her paramours
 Igitur non crimine , non accusatore existente , quia speciem iudicis induere non poterat , ad vim dominationis conversus Gerellanum tribunum cum cohorte militum immittit iubetque praevenire conatus consulis , occupare velut arcem eius , opprimere delectam iuventutem , quia Vestinus imminentes foro aedes decoraque servitia et pari aetate habebat$$ As neither crime nor accuser appeared ,  Nero ,  being thus unable to assume the semblance of a judge ,  had recourse to the sheer might of despotism ,  and despatched Gerellanus ,  a tribune ,  with a cohort of soldiers ,  and with orders to forestall the designs of the consul ,  to seize what he might call his fortress ,  and crush his train of chosen youths For Vestinus had a house towering over the Forum ,  and a host of handsome slaves of the same age
 cuncta eo die munia consulis impleverat conviviumque celebrabat , nihil metuens an dissimulando metu , cum ingressi milites vocari eum a tribuno dixere$$ On that day he had performed all his duties as consul ,  and was entertaining some guests ,  fearless of danger ,  or perhaps by way of hiding his fears ,  when the soldiers entered and announced to him the tribune's summons
 ille nihil demoratus exsurgit , et omnia simul properantur$$ He rose without a moment's delay ,  and every preparation was at once made
 clauditur cubiculo , praesto est medicus , abscinduntur venae , vigens adhuc balneo infertur , calida aqua mersatur , nulla edita voce , qua semet miseraretur$$ He shut himself into his chamber a physician was at his side his veins were opened with life still strong in him ,  he was carried into a bath ,  and plunged into warm water ,  without uttering a word of pity for himself
 circumdati interim custodia qui simul discubuerant , nec nisi provecta nocte omissi sunt , postquam pavorem eorum , ex mensa exitium opperientium , et imaginatus et inridens Nero satis supplicii luisse ait pro epulis consularibus$$ Meanwhile the guards surrounded those who had sat at his table ,  and it was only at a late hour of the night that they were dismissed ,  when Nero ,  having pictured to himself and laughed over their terror at the expectation of a fatal end to their banquet ,  said that they had suffered enough punishment for the consul's entertainment
 Exim Annaei Lucani caedem imperat is profluente sanguine ubi frigescere pedes manusque et paulatim ab extremis cedere spiritum fervido adhuc et compote mentis pectore intellegit , recordatus carmen a se compositum , quo vulneratum militem per eius modi mortis imaginem obisse tradiderat , versus ipsos rettulit , eaque illi suprema vox fuit$$ Next he ordered the destruction of Marcus Annaeus Lucanus As the blood flowed freely from him ,  and he felt a chill creeping through his feet and hands ,  and the life gradually ebbing from his extremities ,  though the heart was still warm and he retained his mental power ,  Lucanus recalled some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded soldier dying a similar kind of death ,  and he recited the very lines These were his last words

 pellitur et Rufrius Crispinus occasione coniurationis , sed Neroni invisus , quod Poppaeam quondam matrimonio tenuerat$$ Rufius Crispinus too was banished ,  on the opportune pretext of the conspiracy ,  but he was in fact hated by Nero ,  because he had once been Poppaea's husband

 tum quasi gesta bello expositurus , vocat senatum et triumphale decus Petronio Turpiliano consulari , Cocceio Nervae praetori designato , Tigellino praefecto praetorii tribuit , Tigellinum et Nervam ita extollens , ut super triumphales in foro imagines apud Palatium quoque effigies eorum sisteret$$ Then ,  as if he was going to describe successes in war ,  he summoned the Senate ,  and awarded triumphal honours to Petronius Turpilianus ,  an ex-consul ,  to Cocceius Nerva ,  praetor-elect ,  and to Tigellinus ,  commander of the praetorians Tigellinus and Nerva he so distinguished as to place busts of them in the palace in addition to triumphal statues in the Forum

 at in senatu cunctis , ut cuique plurimum maeroris , in adulationem demissis , Iunium Gallionem , Senecae fratris morte pavidum et pro sua incolumitate supplicem , increpuit Salienus Clemens , hostem et parricidam vocans , donec consensu patrum deterritus est , ne publicis malis abuti ad occasionem privati odii videretur , neu compostia aut obliterata mansuetudine principis novam ad saevitiam retraheret$$ When every one in the Senate ,  those especially who had most cause to mourn ,  abased himself in flattery ,  Salienus Clemens denounced Junius Gallio ,  who was terror-stricken at his brother Seneca's death was pleading for his life He called him an enemy and traitor to the State ,  till the unanimous voice of the senators deterred him from perverting public miseries into an occasion for a personal resentment ,  and thus importing fresh bitterness into what by the prince's clemency had been hushed up or forgotten
 Tum decreta dona et grates deis decernuntur , propriusque honos Soli , cum est vetus aedes apud circum , in quo facinus parabatur , qui occulta coniurationis suo numine retexisset$$ Then offerings and thanksgivings to the gods were decreed ,  with special honours to the Sun ,  who has an ancient temple in the circus where the crime was planned ,  as having revealed by his power the secrets of the conspiracy

 non enim solitas tantum fruges nec confusum metallis aurum gigni , sed nova ubertate provenire terram et obvias opes deferre deos , quaeque alia summa facundia nec minore adulatione servilia fingebant , securi de facilitate credentis$$ Not only ,  they said ,  were there the usual harvests ,  and the gold of the mine with its alloy ,  but the earth now teemed with a new abundance ,  and wealth was thrust on them by the bounty of the gods These and other servile flatteries they invented ,  with consummate eloquence and equal sycophancy ,  confidently counting on the facility of his belief
 Gliscebat interim luxuria spe inani consumebanturque veteres opes quasi oblatis quas multos per annos prodigeret$$ Extravagance meanwhile increased ,  on the strength of a chimerical hope ,  and ancient wealth was wasted ,  as apparently the emperor had lighted on treasures he might squander for many a year

 nam plebei tribunus erat cohibuit spiritus eius Thrasea ne vana et reo non profutura , intercessori exitiosa inciperet$$ Thrasea checked his impetuous temper ,  not wishing him to attempt what would be as futile ,  and useless to the accused ,  as it would be fatal to the protester

 nemine nominatim compellato patres arguebat quod publica munia desererent eorumque exemplo equites Romani ad segnitiam verterentur$$ Without addressing any one by name ,  he censured the senators for neglecting their public duties ,  and drawing by their example the Roman knights into idleness
 etenim quid mirum e longinquis provinciis haud veniri , cum plerique adepti consulatum et sacerdotia hortorum potius amoenitati inservirent$$ For what wonder is it ,  he asked ,  that men do not come from remote provinces when many ,  after obtaining the consulate or some sacred office ,  give all their thoughts by choice to the beauty of their gardens

 Cum per haec atque talia Marcellus , ut erat torvus ac minax , voce vultu oculis ardesceret , non illa nota et celebritate periculorum sueta iam senatus maestitia , sed novus et altior pavor manus et tela militum cernentibus$$ While Marcellus ,  with the savage and menacing look he usually wore ,  spoke these and like words with rising fury in his voice ,  countenance ,  and eye ,  that familiar grief to which a thick succession of perils had habituated the Senate gave way to a new and profounder panic ,  as they saw the soldiers' hands on their weapons
 simul ipsius Thraseae venerabilis species obversabatur et erant qui Helvidium quoque miserarentur , innoxiae adfinitatis poenas daturum$$ At the same moment the venerable form of Thrasea rose before their imagination ,  and some there were who pitied Helvidius too ,  doomed as he was to suffer for an innocent alliance

 vetera haec sed recens et quo discrimini patris filiatn conectebat , quod pecuniam magis dilargita esset$$ These were bygones ,  but there was a fresh charge involving the daughter in the peril of the father ,  to the effect that she had lavished money on astrologers
 acciderat sane pietate Serviliae (id enim nomen puellae fuit) , quae caritate erga parentem , simul imprudentia aetatis , non tamen aliud consultaverat quam de incolumitate domus , et an placabilis Nero , an cognitio senatus nihil atrox adferret$$ This indeed had really occurred through the filial affection of Servilia (that was the girl's name) ,  who ,  out of love for her father and the thoughtlessness of youth ,  had consulted them ,  only however about the safety of her family ,  whether Nero could be appeased ,  and the trial before the Senate have no dreadful result
 igitur accita est in senatum , steteruntque diversi ante tribunal consulum grandis aevo parens , contra filia intra vicesimum aetatis annum , nuper marito Annio Pollione in exilium pulso viduata desolataque , ac ne patrem quidem intuens cuius onerasse pericula videbatur$$ She was accordingly summoned before the Senate ,  and there they stood facing one another before the consuls' tribunal ,  the aged parent ,  and opposite to him the daughter ,  in the twentieth year of her age ,  widowed and forlorn ,  her husband Annius Pollio having lately been driven into banishment ,  without so much as a glance at her father ,  whose peril she seemed to have aggravated
 Tum interrogante accusatore an cultus dotalis , an detractum cervici monile venum dedisset , quo pecuniam faciendis magicis sacris contraheret , primum strata humi longoque fletu et silentio , post altaria et aram complexa nullos inquit impios deos , nullas devotiones , nec aliud infelicibus precibus invocavi quam ut hunc optimum patrem tu , Caesar , vos , patres , servaretis incolumem$$ Then on the accuser asking her whether she had sold her bridal presents or stript her neck of its ornaments to raise money for the performance of magical rites ,  she at first flung herself on the ground and wept long in silence After awhile ,  clasping the altar steps and altar ,  she exclaimed ,  I have invoked no impious deities ,  no enchantments ,  nor aught else in my unhappy prayers ,  but only that thou ,  Caesar ,  and you ,  senators ,  might preserve unharmed this best of fathers
 sic gemmas et vestis et dignitatis insignia dedi , quo modo si sanguinems et vitam poposcissent$$ My jewels ,  my apparel ,  and the signs of my rank I gave up ,  as I would have given up my life-blood had they demanded it

 mox datus testibus locus et quantum misericordiae saevitia accusationis permoverat , tantum irae Publius Egnatius testis concivit$$ Place was then given to the witnesses ,  and the appearance among them of Publius Egnatius provoked as much indignation as the cruelty of the prosecution had excited pity
 cliens hic Sorani et tunc emptus ad opprimendum amicum auctoritatem Stoicae sectae praeferebat , habitu et ore ad exprimendam imaginem honesti exercitus , ceterum animo perfidiosus , subdolus , avaritiam ac libidinem occultans$$ A client of Soranus ,  and now hired to ruin his friend ,  he professed the dignified character of a Stoic ,  and had trained himself in demeanour and language to exhibit an ideal of virtue In his heart ,  however ,  treacherous and cunning ,  he concealed greed and sensuality
 quae postquam pecunia reclusa sunt , dedit exemplum praecavendi , quo modo fraudibus involutos aut flagitiis commaculatos , sic specie bonarum artium falsos et amicitiae fallacis$$ As soon as money had brought these vices to light ,  he became an example ,  warning us to beware just as much of those who under the guise of virtuous tastes are false and deceitful in friendship ,  as of men wholly entangled in falsehoods and stained with every infamy
 Idem tamen dies et honestum exemplum tulit Cassii Asclepiodoti , qui magnitudine opum praecipuus inter Bithynos , quo obsequio florentem Soranum celebraverat , labantem non deseruit , exutusque omnibus fortunis et in exilium actus , aequitate deum erga bona malaque documenta$$ That same day brought with it a noble pattern in Cassius Asclepiodotus ,  whose vast wealth made him a foremost man in Bithynia He had honoured Soranus in his prosperity with a respect which he did not cast off in his fall ,  and he was now stript of all his property and driven into exile so impartially indifferent is heaven to examples of virtue and vice

 Tum ad Thraseam in hortis agentem quaestor consulis missus vesperascente iam die$$ Then ,  as evening approached ,  the consul's quaestor was sent to Thrasea ,  who was passing his time in his garden
 inlustrium virorum feminarumque coetus frequentis egerat , maxime intentus Demetrio Cynicae institutionis doctori , cum quo , ut coniectare erat intentione vultus et auditis , si qua clarius proloquebantur , de natura animae et dissociatione spiritus corporisque inquirebat , donec advenit Domitius Caecilianus ex intimis amicis et ei quid senatus censuisset exposuit$$ He had had a crowded gathering of distinguished men and women ,  giving special attention to Demetrius ,  a professor of the Cynic philosophy With him ,  as might be inferred from his earnest expression of face and from words heard when they raised their voices ,  he was speculating on the nature of the soul and on the separation of the spirit from the body ,  till Domitius Caecilianus ,  one of his intimate friends ,  came to him and told him in detail what the Senate had decided
 igitur flentis queritantisque qui aderant facessere propere Thrasea neu pericula sua miscere cum sorte damnati hortatur , Arriamque temptantem mariti suprema et exemplum Arriae matris sequi monet retinere vitam filiaeque communi subsidium unicum non adimere$$ When all who were present ,  wept and bitterly complained ,  Thrasea urged them to hasten their departure and not mingle their own perils with the fate of a doomed man Arria ,  too ,  who aspired to follow her husband's end and the example of Arria ,  her mother ,  he counselled to preserve her life ,  and not rob the daughter of their love of her only stay
 Tum progressus in porticum illic a quaestore reperitur , laetitiae propior , quia Helvidium generum suum Italia tantum arceri cognoverat$$ Then he went out into a colonnade ,  where he was found by the quaestor ,  joyful rather than otherwise ,  as he had learnt that Helvidius ,  his son-in-law ,  was merely excluded from Italy
 accepto dehinc senatus consulto Helvidium et Demetrium in cubiculum inducit porrectisque utriusque brachii venis , postquam cruorem effudit , humum super spargens , propius vocato quaestore libamus inquit Iovi liberatori specta , invenis$$ When he heard the Senate's decision ,  he led Helvidius and Demetrius into a chamber ,  and having laid bare the arteries of each arm ,  he let the blood flow freely ,  and ,  as he sprinkled it on the ground ,  he called the quaestor to his side and said ,  We pour out a libation to Jupiter the Deliverer
 et omen quidem dii prohibeant , ceterum in ea tempora natus es quibus firmare animum expediat constantibus exemplis$$ Behold ,  young man ,  and may the gods avert the omen ,  but you have been born into times in which it is well to fortify the spirit with examples of courage

 simul veritas pluribus modis infracta , primum inscitia rei publicae ut alienae , mox libidine adsentandi aut rursus odio adversus dominantis$$ Then too the truthfulness of history was impaired in many ways at first ,  through men's ignorance of public affairs ,  which were now wholly strange to them ,  then ,  through their passion for flattery ,  or ,  on the other hand ,  their hatred of their masters
 ita neutris cura posteritatis inter infensos vel obnoxios$$ And so between the enmity of the one and the servility of the other ,  neither had any regard for posterity
 sed ambitionem scriptoris facile averseris , obtrectatio et livor pronis auribus accipiuntur quippe adulationi foedum crimen servitutis , malignitati falsa species libertatis inest$$ But while we instinctively shrink from a writer's adulation ,  we lend a ready ear to detraction and spite ,  because flattery involves the shameful imputation of servility ,  whereas malignity wears the false appearance of honesty

 nec minus praemia delatorum invisa quam scelera , cum alii sacerdotia et consulatus ut spolia adepti , procurationes alii et interiorem potentiam , agerent verterent cuncta odio et terrore$$ Sacred rites were profaned there was profligacy in the highest ranks the sea was crowded with exiles ,  and its rocks polluted with bloody deeds In the capital there were yet worse horrors Nobility ,  wealth ,  the refusal or the acceptance of office ,  were grounds for accusation ,  and virtue ensured destruction
 corrupti in dominos servi , in patronos liberti$$ The rewards of the informers were no less odious than their crimes
 et quibus deerat inimicus per amicos oppressi$$ for while some seized on consulships and priestly offices ,  as their share of the spoil ,  others on procuratorships ,  and posts of more confidential authority ,  they robbed and ruined in every direction amid universal hatred and terror

 praeter multiplicis rerum humanarum casus caelo terraque prodigia et fulminum monitus et futurorum praesagia , laeta tristia , ambigua manifesta$$ Besides the manifold vicissitudes of human affairs ,  there were prodigies in heaven and earth ,  the warning voices of the thunder ,  and other intimations of the future ,  auspicious or gloomy ,  doubtful or not to be mistaken
 nec enim umquam atrocioribus populi Romani cladibus magisve iustis indiciis adprobatum est non esse curae deis securitatem nostram , esse ultionem$$ Never surely did more terrible calamities of the Roman People ,  or evidence more conclusive ,  prove that the Gods take no thought for our happiness ,  but only for our punishment
 Ceterum antequam destinata componam , repetendum videtur qualis status urbis , quae mens exercituum , quis habitus provinciarum , quid in toto terrarum orbe validum , quid aegrum fuerit , ut non modo casus eventusque rerum , qui plerumque fortuiti sunt , sed ratio etiam causaeque noscantur$$ I think it proper ,  however ,  before I commence my purposed work ,  to pass under review the condition of the capital ,  the temper of the armies ,  the attitude of the provinces ,  and the elements of weakness and strength which existed throughout the whole empire ,  that so we may become acquainted ,  not only with the vicissitudes and the issues of events ,  which are often matters of chance ,  but also with their relations and their causes
 finis Neronis ut laetus primo gaudentium impetu fuerat , ita varios motus animorum non modo in urbe apud patres aut populum aut urbanum militem , sed omnis legiones ducesque conciverat , evulgato imperii arcano posse principem alibi quam Romae fieri$$ Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy ,  yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome ,  among the Senators ,  the people ,  or the soldiery of the capital ,  it had also excited all the legions and their generals for now had been divulged that secret of the empire ,  that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome

 Miles urbanus longo Caesarum sacramento imbutus et ad destituendum Neronem arte magis et impulsu quam suo ingenio traductus , postquam neque dari donativum sub nomine Galbae promissum neque magnis meritis ac praemiis eundem in pace quem in bello locum praeventamque gratiam intellegit apud principem a legionibus factum , pronus ad novas res scelere insuper Nymphidii Sabini praefecti imperium sibi molientis agitatur$$ The soldiery of the capital ,  who were imbued with the spirit of an old allegiance to the Caesars ,  and who had been led to desert Nero by intrigues and influences from without rather than by their own feelings ,  were inclined for change ,  when they found that the donative promised in Galba's name was withheld ,  and reflected that for great services and great rewards there was not the same room in peace as in war ,  and that the favour of an emperor created by the legions must be already preoccupied They were further excited by the treason of Nymphidius Sabinus ,  their prefect ,  who himself aimed at the throne
 et Nymphidius quidem in ipso conatu oppressus , set quamvis capite defectionis ablato manebat plerisque militum conscientia , nec deerant sermones senium atque avaritiam Galbae increpantium$$ Nymphidius indeed perished in the attempt ,  but ,  though the head of the mutiny was thus removed ,  there yet remained in many of the soldiers the consciousness of guilt There were even men who talked in angry terms of the feebleness and avarice of Galba
 laudata olim et militari fama celebrata severitas eius angebat aspernantis veterem disciplinam atque ita quattuordecim annis a Nerone adsuefactos ut haud minus vitia principum amarent quam olim virtutes verebantur$$ The strictness once so commended ,  and celebrated in the praises of the army ,  was galling to troops who rebelled against the old discipline ,  and who had been accustomed by fourteen years' service under Nero to love the vices of their emperors ,  as much as they had once respected their virtues
 accessit Galbae vox pro re publica honesta , ipsi anceps , legi a se militem , non emi$$ To all this was added Galba's own expression ,  I choose my soldiers ,  I do not buy them ,  noble words for the commonwealth ,  but fraught with peril for himself

 introitus in urbem trucidatis tot milibus inermium militum infaustus omine atque ipsis etiam qui occiderant formidolosus$$ Both had perished without hearing or defence ,  like innocent men His entry into the capital ,  made after the slaughter of thousands of unarmed soldiers ,  was most ill-omened ,  and was terrible even to the executioners
 inducta legione Hispana , remanente ea quam e classe Nero conscripserat , plena urbs exercitu insolito$$ As he brought into the city his Spanish legion ,  while that which Nero had levied from the fleet still remained ,  Rome was full of strange troops
 multi ad hoc numeri e Germania ac Britannia et Illyrico , quos idem Nero electos praemissosque ad claustra Caspiarum et bellum , quod in Albanos parabat , opprimendis Vindicis coeptis revocaverat$$ There were also many detachments from Germany ,  Britain ,  and Illyria ,  selected by Nero ,  and sent on by him to the Caspian passes ,  for service in the expedition which he was preparing against the Albani ,  but afterwards recalled to crush the insurrection of Vindex
 ingens novis rebus materia , ut non in unum aliquem prono favore ita audenti parata$$ Here there were vast materials for a revolution ,  without indeed a decided bias towards any one man ,  but ready to a daring hand
 Forte congruerat ut Clodii Macri et Fontei Capitonis caedes nuntiarentur$$ In this conjuncture it happened that tidings of the deaths of Fonteius Capito and Clodius Macer reached the capital

 fuere qui crederent Capitonem ut avaritia et libidine foedum ac maculosum ita cogitatione rerum novarum abstinuisse , sed a legatis bellum suadentibus , postquam impellere nequiverint , crimen ac dolum ultro compositum , et Galbam mobilitate ingenii , an ne altius scrutaretur , quoquo modo acta , quia mutari non poterant , comprobasse$$ There were however some who believed that Capito ,  though foully stained with avarice and profligacy ,  had yet abstained from all thought of revolution ,  that this was a treacherous accusation invented by the commanders themselves ,  who had urged him to take up arms ,  when they found themselves unable to prevail ,  and that Galba had approved of the deed ,  either from weakness of character ,  or to avoid investigation into the circumstances of acts which could not be altered
 ceterum utraque caedes sinistre accepta , et inviso semel principi seu bene seu male facta parem invidiam adferebant$$ Both executions ,  however ,  were unfavourably regarded indeed ,  when a ruler once becomes unpopular ,  all his acts ,  be they good or bad ,  tell against him
 venalia cuncta , praepotentes liberti , servorum manus subitis avidae et tamquamm apud senem festinantes , eademque novae aulae mala , aeque gravia , non aeque excusata$$ The freedmen in their excessive power were now putting up everything for sale the slaves caught with greedy hands at immediate gain ,  and ,  reflecting on their master's age ,  hastened to be rich
 ipsa aetas Galbae inrisui ac fastidio erat adsuetis iuventae Neronis et imperatores forma ac decore corporis , ut est mos vulgi , comparantibus$$ The new court had the same abuses as the old ,  abuses as grievous as ever ,  but not so readily excused Even the age of Galba caused ridicule and disgust among those whose associations were with the youth of Nero ,  and who were accustomed ,  as is the fashion of the vulgar ,  to value their emperors by the beauty and grace of their persons
 Et hic quidem Romae , tamquam in tanta multitudine , habitus animorum fuit$$ Such ,  as far as one can speak of so vast a multitude ,  was the state of feeling at Rome
 e provinciis Hispaniae praeerat Cluvius Rufus , vir facundus et pacis artibus , bellis inexpertus$$ Among the provinces ,  Spain was under the government of Cluvius Rufus ,  an eloquent man ,  who had all the accomplishments of civil life ,  but who was without experience in war
 Galliae super memoriam Vindicis obligatae recenti dono Romanae civitatis et in posterum tributi levamento$$ Gaul ,  besides remembering Vindex ,  was bound to Galba by the recently conceded privileges of citizenship ,  and by the diminution of its future tribute
 proximae tamen Germanicis exercitibus Galliarum civitates non eodem honore habitae , quaedam etiam finibus ademptis pari dolore commoda aliena ac suas iniurias metiebantur$$ Those Gallic states ,  however ,  which were nearest to the armies of Germany ,  had not been treated with the same respect ,  and had even in some cases been deprived of their territory and these were reckoning the gains of others and their own losses with equal indignation
 Germanici exercitus , quod periculosissimum in tantis viribus , solliciti et irati , superbia recentis victoriae et metu tamquam alias partis fovissent$$ The armies of Germany were at once alarmed and angry ,  a most dangerous temper when allied with such strength while elated by their recent victory ,  they feared because they might seem to have supported an unsuccessful party
 tarde a Nerone desciverant , nec statim pro Galba Verginius$$ They had been slow to revolt from Nero ,  and Verginius had not immediately declared for Galba
 an imperare noluisset dubium delatum ei a milite imperium conveniebat$$ it was doubtful whether he had himself wished to be emperor ,  but all agreed that the empire had been offered to him by the soldiery
 Fonteium Capitonem occisum etiam qui queri non poterant , tamen indignabantur$$ Again ,  the execution of Capito was a subject of indignation ,  even with those who could not complain of its injustice
 dux deerat abducto Verginio per simulationem amicitiae$$ They had no leader ,  for Verginius had been withdrawn on the pretext of his friendship with the Emperor
 quem non remitti atque etiam reum esse tamquam suum crimen accipiebant$$ That he was not sent back ,  and that he was even impeached ,  they regarded as an accusation against themselves
 Aegyptum copiasque , quibus coerceretur , iam inde a divo Augusto equites Romani obtinent loco regum$$ Ever since the time of the Divine Augustus Roman Knights have ruled Egypt as kings ,  and the forces by which it has to be kept in subjection
 ita visum expedire , provinciam aditu difficilem , annonae fecundam , superstitione ac lascivia discordem et mobilem , insciam legum , ignaram magistratuum , domi retinere$$ It has been thought expedient thus to keep under home control a province so difficult of access ,  so productive of corn ,  ever distracted ,  excitable ,  and restless through the superstition and licentiousness of its inhabitants ,  knowing nothing of laws ,  and unused to civil rule
 regebat tum Tiberius Alexander , eiusdem nationis$$ Its governor was at this time Tiberius Alexander ,  a native of the country
 Africa ac legiones in ea interfecto Clodio Macro contenta qualicumque principe post experimentum domini minoris$$ Africa and its legions ,  now that Clodius Macer was dead ,  were disposed to be content with any emperor ,  after having experienced the rule of a smaller tyrant
 duae Mauretaniae , Raetia , Noricum , Thraecia et quae aliae procuratoribus cohibentur , ut cuique exercitui vicinae , ita in favorem aut odium contactu valentiorum agebantur$$ The two divisions of Mauritania ,  Rhaetia ,  Noricum and Thrace and the other provinces governed by procurators ,  as they were near this or that army ,  were driven by the presence of such powerful neighbours into friendship or hostility
 inermes provinciae atque ipsa in primis Italia , cuicumque servitio exposita , in pretium belli cessurae erant$$ The unarmed provinces with Italy at their head were exposed to any kind of slavery ,  and were ready to become the prize of victory
 hic fuit rerum Romanarum status , cum Servius Galba iterum Titus Vinius consules inchoavere annum sibi ultimum , rei publicae prope supremum$$ Such was the state of the Roman world ,  when Servius Galba ,  consul for the second time ,  with T Vinius for his colleague ,  entered upon a year ,  which was to be the last of their lives ,  and which well nigh brought the commonwealth to an end
 Paucis post kalendas Ianuarias diebus Pompei Propinqui procuratoris e Belgica litterae adferuntur , supeioris Germaniae legiones rupta sacramenti reverentia imperatorem alium flagitare et senatui ac populo Romano arbitrium eligendi permittere quo seditio mollius acciperetur$$ A few days after the 1st of January ,  there arrived from Belgica despatches of Pompeius Propinquus ,  the Procurator ,  to this effect that the legions of Upper Germany had broken through the obligation of their military oath ,  and were demanding another emperor ,  but conceded the power of choice to the Senate and people of Rome ,  in the hope that a more lenient view might be taken of their revolt
 maturavit ea res consilium Galbae iam pridem de adoptione secum et cum proximis agitantis$$ These tidings hastened the plans of Galba ,  who had been long debating the subject of adoption with himself and with his intimate friends
 non sane crebrior tota civitate sermo per illos mensis fuerat , primum licentia ac libidine talia loquendi , dein fessa iam aetate Galbae$$ There was indeed no more frequent subject of conversation during these months ,  at first because men had liberty and inclination to talk of such matters ,  afterwards because the feebleness of Galba was notorious
 paucis iudicium aut rei publicae amor multi stulta spe , prout quis amicus vel cliens , hunc vel illum ambitiosis rumoribus destinabant , etiam in Titi Vinii odium , qui in dies quanto potentior eodem actu invisior erat$$ Few had any discrimination or patriotism ,  many had foolish hopes for themselves ,  and spread interested reports ,  in which they named this or that person to whom they might be related as friend or dependant They were also moved by hatred of T Vinius ,  who grew daily more powerful ,  and in the same proportion more unpopular
 quippe hiantis in magna fortuna amicorum cupiditates ipsa Galbae facilitas intendebat , cum apud infirmum et credulum minore metu et maiore praemio peccaretur$$ The very easiness of Galba's temper stimulated the greedy cupidity which great advancement had excited in his friends ,  because with one so weak and so credulous wrong might be done with less risk and greater gain
 Potentia principatus divisa in Titum Vinium consulem Cornelium Laconem praetorii praefectum$$ The real power of the Empire was divided between T
 nec minor gratia Icelo Galbae liberto , quem anulis donatum equestri nomine Marcianum vocitabant$$ Vinius ,  the consul ,  and Cornelius Laco ,  prefect of the Praetorian Guard
 hi discordes et rebus minoribus sibi quisque tendentes , circa consilium eligendi successoris in duas factiones scindebantur$$ Icelus ,  a freedman of Galba ,  was in equal favour he had been presented with the rings of knighthood ,  and bore the Equestrian name of Martianus
 Vinius pro Marcus Othone , Laco atque Icelus consensu non tam unum aliquem fovebant quam alium$$ These men ,  being at variance ,  and in smaller matters pursuing their own aims ,  were divided in the affair of choosing a successor ,  into two opposing factions
 neque erat Galbae ignota Othonis ac Titi Vinii amicitia$$ T
 et rumoribus nihil silentio transmittentium , quia Vinio vidua filia , caelebs Otho , gener ac socer destinabantur$$ Vinius was for Marcus Otho ,  Laco and Icelus agreed ,  not indeed in supporting any particular individual ,  but in striving for some one else
 credo et rei publicae curam subisse , frustra a Nerone translatae si apud Othonem relinqueretur$$ Galba indeed was aware of the friendship between Vinius and Otho
 namque Otho pueritiam incuriose , adulescentiam petulanter egerat , gratus Neroni aemulatione luxus$$ the gossip of those who allow nothing to pass in silence had named them as father-in-law and son-in-law ,  for Vinius had a widowed daughter ,  and Otho was unmarried
 eoque Poppaeam Sabinam , principale scortum , ut apud conscium libidinum deposuerat , donec Octaviam uxorem amoliretur$$ I believe that he had also at heart some care for the commonwealth ,  in vain ,  he would think ,  rescued from Nero ,  if it was to be left with Otho
 mox suspectum in eadem Poppaea in provinciam Lusitaniam specie legationis seposuit$$ For Otho's had been a neglected boyhood and a riotous youth ,  and he had made himself agreeable to Nero by emulating his profligacy
 Otho comiter administrata provincia primus in partis transgressus nec segnis et , donec bellum fuit , inter praesentis splendidissimus , spem adoptionis statim conceptam acrius in dies rapiebat , faventibus plerisque militum , prona in eum aula Neronis ut similem$$ For this reason the Emperor had entrusted to him ,  as being the confidant of his amours ,  Poppaea Sabina ,  the imperial favourite ,  until he could rid himself of his wife Octavia Soon suspecting him with regard to this same Poppaea ,  he sent him out of the way to the province of Lusitania ,  ostensibly to be its governor
 Sed Galba post nuntios Germanicae seditionis , quamquam nihil adhuc de Vitellio certum , anxius quonam exercituum vis erumperet , ne urbano quidem militi confisus , quod remedium unicum rebatur , comitia imperii transigit$$ When Galba heard of the mutiny in Germany ,  though nothing was as yet known about Vitellius ,  he felt anxious as to the direction which the violence of the legions might take ,  while he could not trust even the soldiery of the capital He therefore resorted to what he supposed to be the only remedy ,  and held a council for the election of an emperor
 adhibitoque super Vinium ac Laconem Mario Celso consule designato ac Ducenio Gemino praefecto urbis , pauca praefatus de sua senectute , Pisonem Licinianum accersiri iubet , seu propria electione sive , ut quidam crediderunt , Lacone instante , cui apud Rubellium Plautum exercita cum Pisone amicitia$$ To this he summoned ,  besides Vinius and Laco ,  Marius Celsus ,  consul elect ,  and Ducennius Geminus ,  prefect of the city Having first said a few words about his advanced years ,  he ordered Piso Licinianus to be summoned It is uncertain whether he acted on his own free choice ,  or ,  as believed by some ,  under the influence of Laco ,  who through Rubellius Plautus had cultivated the friendship of Piso
 sed callide ut ignotum fovebat , et prospera de Pisone fama consilio eius fidem addiderat$$ But ,  cunningly enough ,  it was as a stranger that Laco supported him ,  and the high character of Piso gave weight to his advice
 Piso Marcus Crasso et Scribonia genitus , nobilis utrimque , vultu habituque moris antiqui et aestimatione recta severus , deterius interpretantibus tristior habebatur$$ Piso ,  who was the son of M Crassus and Scribonia ,  and thus of noble descent on both sides ,  was in look and manner a man of the old type Rightly judged ,  he seemed a stern man ,  morose to those who estimated him less favourably
 ea pars morum eius quo suspectior sollicitis adoptanti placebat$$ This point in his character pleased his adopted father in proportion as it raised the anxious suspicions of others
 Igitur Galba , adprehensa Pisonis manu , in hunc modum locutus fertur$$ We are told that Galba ,  taking hold of Piso's hand ,  spoke to this effect 
 si te privatus lege curiata apud pontifices , ut moris est , adoptarem , et mihi egregium erat Gnaeus Pompei et Marcus Crassi subolem in penatis meos adsciscere , et tibi insigne Sulpiciae ac Lutatiae decora nobilitati tuae adiecisse$$  If I were a private man ,  and were now adopting you by the Act of the Curiae before the Pontiffs ,  as our custom is ,  it would be a high honour to me to introduce into my family a descendant of Cn Pompeius and M
 nunc me deorum hominumque consensu ad imperium vocatum praeclara indoles tua et amor patriae impulit ut principatum , de quo maiores nostri armis certabant , bello adeptus quiescenti offeram , exemplo divi Augusti qui sororis filium Marcellum , dein generum Agrippam , mox nepotes sus , postremo Tiberium Neronem privignum in proximo sibi fastigio conlocavit$$ Crassus it would be a distinction to you to add to the nobility of your race the honours of the Sulpician and Lutatian houses As it is ,  I ,  who have been called to the throne by the unanimous consent of gods and men ,  am moved by your splendid endowments and by my own patriotism to offer to you ,  a man of peace ,  that power ,  for which our ancestors fought ,  and which I myself obtained by war
 sed Augustus in domo successorem quaesivit , ego in re publica , non quia propinquos aut socios belli non habeam , sed neque ipse imperium ambitione accepi , et iudicii mei documentum sit non meae tantum necessitudines , quas tibi postposui , sed et tuae$$ I am following the precedent of the Divine Augustus ,  who placed on an eminence next to his own ,  first his nephew Marcellus ,  then his son-in-law Agrippa ,  afterwards his grandsons ,  and finally Tiberius Nero ,  his stepson
 est tibi frater pari nobilitate , natu maior , dignus hac fortuna nisi tu potior esses ea aetas tua quae cupiditates adulescentiae iam effugerit , ea vita in qua nihil praeteritum excusandum habeas$$ But Augustus looked for a successor in his own family ,  I look for one in the state ,  not because I have no relatives or companions of my campaigns ,  but because it was not by any private favour that I myself received the imperial power
 fortunam adhuc tantum adversam tulisti$$ Let the principle of my choice be shown not only by my connections which I have set aside for you ,  but by your own
 secundae res acrioribus stimulis animos explorant , quia miseriae tolerantur , felicitate corrumpimur$$ You have a brother ,  noble as yourself ,  and older ,  who would be well worthy of this dignity ,  were you not worthier
 fidem , libertatem , amicitiam , praecipua humani animi bona , tu quidem eadem constantia retinebis , sed alii per obsequium imminuent$$ Your age is such as to be now free from the passions of youth ,  and such your life that in the past you have nothing to excuse
 inrumpet adulatio , blanditiae et pessimum veri adfectus venenum , sua cuique utilitas$$ Hitherto ,  you have only borne adversity
 etiam si ego ac tu simplicissime inter nos hodie loquimur , ceteri libentius cum fortuna nostra quam nobiscum$$ prosperity tries the heart with keener temptations
 nam suadere principi quod oporteat multi laboris , adsentatio erga quemcumque principem sine adfectu peragitur$$ for hardships may be endured ,  whereas we are spoiled by success
 Si immensum imperii corpus stare ac librari sine rectore posset , dignus eram a quo res publica inciperet$$ Could the vast frame of this empire have stood and preserved its balance without a directing spirit ,  I was not unworthy of inaugurating a republic
 nunc eo necessitatis iam pridem ventum est ut nec mea senectus conferre plus populo Romano possit quam bonum successorem , nec tua plus iuventa quam bonum principem$$ As it is ,  we have been long reduced to a position ,  in which my age confer no greater boon on the Roman people than a good successor ,  your youth no greater than a good emperor
 sub Tiberio et Gaio et Claudio unius familiae quasi hereditas fuimus$$ Under Tuberous ,  Chairs ,  and Claudius ,  we were ,  so to speak ,  the inheritance of a single family
 loco libertatis erit quod eligi coepimus$$ The choice which begins with us will be a substitute for freedom
 et finita Iuliorum Claudiorumque domo optimum quemque adoptio inveniet$$ Now that the family of the Julii and the Claudii has come to an end ,  adoption will discover the worthiest successor
 nam generari et nasci a principibus fortuitum , nec ultra aestimatur$$ To be begotten and born of a princely race is a mere accident ,  and is only valued as such
 adoptandi iudicium integrum et , si velis eligere , consensu monstratur$$ In adoption there is nothing that need bias the judgment ,  and if you wish to make a choice ,  an unanimous opinion points out the man
 sit ante oculos Nero quem longa Caesarum serie tumentem non Vindex cum inermi provincia aut ego cum una legione , sed sua immanitas , sua luxuria cervicibus publicis depulerunt$$ Let Nero be ever before your eyes ,  swollen with the pride of a long line of Caesars it was not Vindex with his unarmed province ,  it was not myself with my single legion ,  that shook his yoke from our necks
 neque erat adhuc damnati principis exemplum$$ It was his own profligacy ,  his own brutality ,  and that ,  though there had been before no precedent of an emperor condemned by his own people
 nos bello et ab aestimantibus adsciti cum invidia quamvis egregii erimus$$ We ,  who have been called to power by the issues of war ,  and by the deliberate judgment of others ,  shall incur unpopularity ,  however illustrious our character
 ne tamen territus fueris si duae legiones in hoc concussi orbis motu nondum quiescunt$$ Do not however be alarmed ,  if ,  after a movement which has shaken the world ,  two legions are not yet quiet
 ne ipse quidem ad securas res accessi , et audita adoptione desinam videri senex , quod nunc mihi unum obicitur$$ I did not myself succeed to a throne without anxiety
 Nero a pessimo quoque semper desiderabitur$$ and when men shall hear of your adoption I shall no longer be thought old ,  and this is the only objection which is now made against me
 mihi ac tibi providendum est ne etiam a bonis desideretur$$ Nero will always be regretted by the thoroughly depraved
 monere diutius neque temporis huius , et impletum est omne consilium si te bene elegi$$ it is for you and me to take care ,  that he be not regretted also by the good
 utilissimus idem ac brevissimus bonarum malarumque rerum dilectus est , cogitare quid aut volueris sub alio principe aut nolueris$$ To prolong such advice ,  suits not this occasion ,  and all my purpose is fulfilled if I have made a good choice in you
 neque enim hic , ut gentibus quae regnantur , certa dominorum domus et ceteri servi , sed imperaturus es hominibus qui , nec totam servitutem pati possunt nec totam libertatem$$ The most practical and the shortest method of distinguishing between good and bad measures ,  is to think what you yourself would or would not like under another emperor
 et Galba quidem haec ac talia , tamquam principem faceret , ceteri tamquam cum facto loquebantur$$ It is not here ,  as it is among nations despotically ruled ,  that there is a distinct governing family ,  while all the rest are slaves
 Pisonem ferunt statim intuentibus et mox coniectis in eum omnium oculis nullum turbati aut exultantis animi motum prodidisse$$ It is said of Piso that he betrayed no discomposure or excessive joy ,  either to the gaze to which he was immediately subjected ,  or afterwards when all eyes were turned upon him
 sermo erga patrem imperatoremque reverens , de se moderatus$$ His language to the Emperor ,  his father ,  was reverential
 nihil in vultu habituque mutatum , quasi imperare posset magis quam vellet$$ his language about himself was modest He shewed no change in look or manner
 consultatum inde , pro rostris an in senatu an in castris adoptio nuncuparetur iri in castra placuit$$ he seemed like one who had the power rather than the wish to rule It was next discussed whether the adoption should be publicly pronounced in front of the Rostra ,  in the Senate ,  or in the camp
 honorificum id militibus fore , quorum favorem ut largitione et ambitu male adquiri , ita per bonas artis haud spernendum$$ It was thought best to go to the camp This would be a compliment to the soldiery ,  and their favour ,  base as it was to purchase it by bribery or intrigue ,  was not to be despised if it could be obtained by honourable means
 circumsteterat interim Palatium publica expectatio , magni secreti impatiens et male coercitam famam supprimentes augebant$$ Meanwhile the expectant people had surrounded the palace ,  impatient to learn the great secret ,  and those who sought to stifle the ill-concealed rumour did but spread it the more
 Inde apud senatum non comptior Galbae , non longior quam apud militem sermo$$ Then followed Galba's speech in the Senate ,  which was as plain and brief as his speech to the soldiery
 Pisonis comis oratio$$ Piso delivered a graceful oration and was supported by the feeling of the Senate
 et patrum favor aderat$$ Many who wished him well ,  spoke with enthusiasm
 multi voluntate , effusius qui noluerant , medii ac plurimi obvio obsequio , privatas spes agitantes sine publica cura$$ those who had opposed him ,  in moderate terms the majority met him with an officious homage ,  having aims of their own and no thought for the state
 nec aliud sequenti quadriduo , quod medium inter adoptionem et caedem fuit , dictum a Pisone in publico factumve$$ Piso neither said nor did anything else in public in the following four days which intervened between his adoption and his death
 crebrioribus in dies Germanicae defectionis nuntiis et facili civitate ad accipienda credendaque omnia nova cum tristia sunt , censuerant patres mittendos ad Germanicum exercitum legatos$$ As tidings of the mutiny in Germany were arriving with daily increasing frequency ,  while the country was ready to receive and to credit all intelligence that had an unfavourable character ,  the Senate came to a resolution to send deputies to the German armies
 agitatum secreto num et Piso proficisceretur , maiore praetextu , illi auctoritatem senatus , hic dignationem Caesaris laturus$$ It was privately discussed whether Piso should go with them to give them a more imposing appearance they ,  it was said ,  would bring with them the authority of the Senate ,  he the majesty of the Caesar
 placebat et Laconem praetorii praefectum simul mitti$$ It was thought expedient to send with them Cornelius Laco ,  prefect of the Praetorian Guard ,  but he thwarted the design
 is consilio intercessit legati quoque (nam senatus electionem Galbae permiserat) foeda inconstantia nominati , excusati , substituti , ambitu remanendi aut eundi , ut quemque metus vel spes impulerat$$ In nominating ,  excusing ,  and changing the deputies ,  the Senate having entrusted the selection to Galba ,  the Emperor shewed a disgraceful want of firmness ,  yielding to individuals ,  who made interest to stay or to go ,  as their fears or their hopes prompted
 Interea Othonem , cui compositis rebus nulla spes , omne in turbido consilium , multa simul extimulabant , luxuria etiam principi onerosa , inopia vix privato toleranda , in Galbam ira , in Pisonem invidia$$ Otho ,  meanwhile ,  who had nothing to hope while the State was tranquil ,  and whose whole plans depended on revolution ,  was being roused to action by a combination of many motives ,  by a luxury that would have embarrassed even an emperor ,  by a poverty that a subject could hardly endure ,  by his rage against Galba ,  by his envy of Piso
 fingebat et metum quo magis concupisceret$$ He even pretended to fear to make himself keener in desire
 praegravem se Neroni fuisse , nec Lusitaniam rursus et alterius exilii honorem expectandum$$ I was ,  said he ,  too formidable to Nero ,  and I must not look for another Lusitania ,  another honourable exile
 suspectum semper invisumque dominanus qui proximus destinaretur$$ Rulers always suspect and hate the man who has been named for the succession
 nocuisse id sibi apud senem principem , magis nociturum apud iuvenem ingenio trucem et longo exilio efferatum$$ This has injured me with the aged Emperor ,  and will injure me yet more with a young man whose temper ,  naturally savage ,  has been rendered ferocious by prolonged exile
 occidi Othonem posse proinde agendum audendumque , dum Galbae auctoritas fluxa , Pisonis nondum coaluisset$$ How easy to put Otho to death! I must therefore do and dare now while Galba's authority is still unsettled ,  and before that of Piso is consolidated
 opportunos magnis conatibus transitus rerum , nec cunctatione opus , ubi perniciosior sit quies quam temeritas$$ Periods of transition suit great attempts ,  and delay is useless where inaction is more hurtful than temerity
 mortem omnibus ex natura aequalem oblivione apud posteros vel gloria distingui$$ Death ,  which nature ordains for all alike ,  yet admits of the distinction of being either forgotten ,  or remembered with honour by posterity
 ac si nocentem innocentemque idem exitus maneat , acrioris viri esse merito perire$$ and ,  if the same lot awaits the innocent and the guilty ,  the man of spirit will at least deserve his fate
 Non erat Othonis mollis et corpori similis animus$$ The soul of Otho was not effeminate like his person
 et intimi libertorum servorumque , corruptius quam in privata domo habiti , aulam Neronis et luxus , adulteria , matrimonia ceterasque regnorum libidines avido talium , si auderet , ut sua ostentantes , quiescenti ut aliena exprobrabant , urgentibus etiam mathematicis , dum novos motus et clarum Othoni annum observatione siderum adfirmant , genus hominum potentibus infidum , sperantibus fallax , quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur multos secreta Poppaeae mathematicos pessimum principalis matrimonii instrumentum , habuerant$$ His confidential freedmen and slaves ,  who enjoyed a license unknown in private families ,  brought the debaucheries of Nero's court ,  its intrigues ,  its easy marriages ,  and the other indulgences of despotic power ,  before a mind passionately fond of such things ,  dwelt upon them as his if he dared to seize them ,  and reproached the inaction that would leave them to others The astrologers also urged him to action ,  predicting from their observation of the heavens revolutions ,  and a year of glory for Otho This is a class of men ,  whom the powerful cannot trust ,  and who deceive the aspiring ,  a class which will always be proscribed in this country ,  and yet always retained
 e quibus Ptolemaeus Othoni in Hispania comes , cum superfuturum eum Neroni promisisset , postquam ex eventu fides , coniectura iam et rumore senium Galbae et iuventam Othonis computantium persuaserat fore ut in imperium adscisceretur$$ Many of these men were attached to the secret councils of Poppaea and were the vilest tools in the employ of the imperial household One of them ,  Ptolemaeus ,  had attended Otho in Spain ,  and had there foretold that his patron would survive Nero
 sed Otho tamquam peritia et monitu fatorum praedicta accipiebat , cupidine ingenii humani libentius obscura credendi$$ Gaining credit by the result ,  and arguing from his own conjectures and from the common talk of those who compared Galba's age with Otho's youth ,  he had persuaded the latter that he would be called to the throne
 nec deerat Ptolemaeus , iam et sceleris instinctor , ad quod facillime ab eius modi voto transitur$$ Otho however received the prediction as the words of wisdom and the intimation of destiny ,  with that inclination so natural to the human mind readily to believe in the mysterious
 Sed sceleris cogitatio incertum an repens$$ Nor did Ptolemaeus fail to play his part
 studia militum iam pridem spe successionis aut paratu facinoris adfectaverat , in itinere , in agmine , in stationibus vetustissimum quemque militum nomine vocans ac memoria Neroniani comitatus contubernalis appellando alios agnoscere , quosdam requirere et pecunia aut gratia iuvare , inserendo saepius querelas et ambiguos de Galba sermones quaeque alia turbamenta vulgi labores itinerum , inopia commeatuum , duritia imperii atrocius accipiebantur , cum Campaniae lacus et Achaiae urbes classibus adire soliti Pyrenaeum et Alpes et immensa viarum spatia aegre sub armis eniterentur$$ he now even prompted to crime ,  to which from such wishes it is easy to pass Whether indeed these thoughts of crime were suddenly conceived ,  is doubtful Otho had long been courting the affections of the soldiery ,  either in the hope of succeeding to the throne ,  or in preparation for some desperate act On the march ,  on parade ,  and in their quarters ,  he would address all the oldest soldiers by name ,  and in allusion to the progresses of Nero would call them his messmates Some he would recognise ,  he would inquire after others ,  and would help them with his money and interest He would often intersperse his conversation with complaints and insinuations against Galba and anything else that might excite the vulgar mind Laborious marches ,  a scanty commissariat ,  and the rigour of military discipline ,  were especially distasteful ,  when men ,  accustomed to sail to the lakes of Campania and the cities of Greece ,  had painfully to struggle under the weight of their arms over the Pyrenees ,  the Alps ,  and vast distances of road
 Flagrantibus iam militum animis velut faces addiderat Maevius Pudens , e proximis Tigellini$$ The minds of the soldiery were already on fire ,  when Maevius Pudens ,  a near relative of Tigellinus ,  added ,  so to speak ,  fuel to the flames
 is mobilissimum quemque ingenio aut pecuniae indigum et in novas cupiditates praecipitem adliciendo eo paulatim progressus est ut per speciem convivii , quotiens Galba apud Othonem epularetur , cohorti excubias agenti viritim centenos nummos divideret$$ In his endeavour to win over all who were particularly weak in character ,  or who wanted money and were ready to plunge into revolution ,  he gradually went so far as to distribute ,  whenever Galba dined with Otho ,  one hundred sesterces to each soldier of the cohort on duty ,  under pretext of treating them This ,  which we may almost call a public bounty ,  Otho followed up by presents more privately bestowed on individuals
 quam velut publicam largitionem Otho secretioribus apud singulos praemiis intendebat , adeo animosus corruptor ut Cocceio Proculo speculatori , de parte finium cum vicino ambigenti , universum vicini agrum sua pecunia emptum dono dederit , per socordiam praefecti , quem nota pariter et occulta fallebant$$ nay he bribed with such spirit ,  that ,  finding there was a dispute between Cocceius Proculus ,  a soldier of the bodyguard ,  and one of his neighbours ,  about some part of their boundaries ,  he purchased with his own money the neighbour's entire estate ,  and made a present of it to the soldier He took advantage of the lazy indifference of the Prefect ,  who overlooked alike notorious facts and secret practices
 Sed tum e libertis Onomastum futuro sceleri praefecit , a quo Barbium Proculum tesserarium speculatorum et Veturium optionem eorundem perductos , postquam vario sermone callidos audacisque cognovit , pretio et promissis onerat , data pecunia ad pertemptandos plurium animos$$ He then entrusted the conduct of his meditated treason to Onomastus ,  one of his freedmen ,  who brought over to his views Barbius Proculus ,  officer of the watchword to the bodyguard ,  and Veturius ,  a deputy centurion in the same force Having assured himself by various conversations with these men that they were cunning and bold ,  he loaded them with presents and promises ,  and furnished them with money with which to tempt the cupidity of others

 adeoque parata apud malos seditio , etiam apud integros dissimulatio fuit , ut postero iduum die redeuntem a cena Othonem rapturi fuerint , ni incerta noctis et tota urbe sparsa militum castra nec facilem inter temulentos consensum timuissent , non rei publicae cura , quam foedare principis sui sanguine sobrii parabant , sed ne per tenebras , ut quisque Pannonici vel Germanici exercitus militibus oblatus esset , ignorantibus plerisque , pro Othone destinaretur$$ So ripe were the disaffected for mutiny and so close the secrecy preserved by the loyal ,  that they would actually have seized Otho on the 14th of January ,  as he was returning from dinner ,  had they not been deterred by the risks of darkness ,  the inconvenient dispersion of the troops over the whole city ,  and the difficulty of concerted action among a half-intoxicated crowd It was no care for the state ,  which they deliberately meditated polluting with the blood of their Emperor it was a fear lest in the darkness of night any one who presented himself to the soldiers of the Pannonian or German army might be fixed on instead of Otho ,  whom few of them knew
 multa erumpentis seditionis indicia per conscios oppressa$$ Many symptoms of the approaching outburst were repressed by those who were in the secret

 Octavo decimo kalendas Februarias sacrificanti pro aede Apollinis Galbae haruspex Vmbricius tristia exta et instantis insidias ac domesticum hostem praedicit , audiente Othone (nam proximus adstiterat) idque ut laetum e contrario et suis cogitationibus prosperum interpretante$$ On the 15th of January ,  as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of Apollo ,  the Haruspex Umbricius announced to him that the entrails had a sinister aspect ,  that treachery threatened him ,  that he had an enemy at home Otho heard ,  for he had taken his place close by ,  and interpreted it by contraries in a favourable sense ,  as promising success to his designs

 Vniversa iam plebs Palatium implebat , mixtis servitiis et dissono clamore caedem Othonis et coniuratorum exitium poscentium ut si in circo aut theatro ludicrum aliquod postularent$$ The whole populace and the slaves with them were now crowding the palace ,  clamouring with discordant shouts for the death of Otho and the destruction of the conspirators ,  just as if they were demanding some spectacle in the circus or amphitheatre
 neque illis iudicium aut veritas , quippe eodem die diversa pari certamine postulaturis , sed tradito more quemcumque principem adulandi licentia adclamationum et studiis inanibus$$ They had not indeed any discrimination or sincerity ,  for on that same day they would raise with equal zeal a wholly different cry It was their traditional custom to flatter any ruler with reckless applause and meaningless zeal
 Interim Galbam duae sententiae distinebat$$ Meanwhile two suggestions were keeping Galba in doubt
 Titus Vinius manendum intra domum , opponenda servitia , firmandos aditus , non eundum ad iratos censebat$$ T Vinius thought that he should remain within the palace ,  array the slaves against the foe ,  secure the approaches ,  and not go out to the enraged soldiers

 praemissus tamen in castra Piso , ut iuvenis magno nomine , recenti favore et infensus Tito Vinio , seu quia erat seu quia irati ita volebant et facilius de odio creditur$$ Piso was sent on into the camp ,  as being a young man of noble name ,  whose popularity was of recent date ,  and who was a bitter enemy to T Vinius ,  that is ,  either he was so in reality ,  or these angry partisans would have it so ,  and belief in hatred is but too ready
 vixdum egresso Pisone occisum in castris Othonem vagus primum et incertus rumor$$ Piso had hardly gone forth when there came a rumour ,  at first vague and wanting confirmation ,  that Otho had been slain in the camp
 mox , ut in magnis mendaciis , interfuisse se quidam et vidisse adfirmabant , credula fama inter gaudentis et incuriosos$$ soon ,  as happens with these great fictions ,  men asserted that they had been present ,  and had seen the deed and ,  between the delight of some and the indifference of others ,  the report was easily believed
 multi arbitrabantur compositum auctumque rumorem mixtis iam Othonianis , qui ad evocandum Galbam laeta falso vulgaverint$$ Many thought the rumour had been invented and circulated by the Othonianists ,  who were now mingling with the crowd ,  and who disseminated these false tidings of success to draw Galba out of the palace
 Tum vero non populus tantum et imperita plebs in plausus et immodica studia sed equitum plerique ac senatorum , posito metu incauti , refractis Palatii foribus ruere intus ac se Galbae ostentare , praereptam sibi ultionem querentes , ignavissimus quisque et , ut res docuit , in periculo non ausurus , nimii verbis , linguae feroces$$ Upon this not only did the people and the ignorant rabble break out into applause and vehement expressions of zeal ,  but many of the Knights and Senators ,  losing their caution as they laid aside their fear ,  burst open the doors of the palace ,  rushed in ,  and displayed themselves to Galba ,  complaining that their revenge had been snatched from them The most arrant coward ,  the man ,  who ,  as the event proved ,  would dare nothing in the moment of danger ,  was the most voluble and fierce of speech
 nemo scire et omnes adfirmare , donec inopia veri et consensu errantium victus sumpto thorace Galba inruenti turbae neque aetate neque corpore resistens sella levaretur obvius in Palatio Iulius Atticus speculator , cruentum gladium ostentans , occisum a se Othonem exclamavit$$ No one knew anything ,  yet all were confident in assertion ,  till at length Galba in the dearth of all true intelligence ,  and overborne by the universal delusion ,  assumed his cuirass ,  and as ,  from age and bodily weakness ,  he could not stand up against the crowd that was still rushing in ,  he was elevated on a chair He was met in the palace by Julius Atticus ,  a soldier of the body-guard ,  who ,  displaying a bloody sword ,  cried I have slain Otho
 et Galba commilito , inquit , quis iussit$$ Comrade ,  replied Galba ,  who gave the order
 insigni animo ad coercendam militarem licentiam , minantibus intrepidus , adversus blandientis incorruptus$$ So singularly resolute was his spirit in curbing the license of the soldiery threats did not dismay him ,  nor flatteries seduce
 Haud dubiae iam in castris omnium mentes tantusque ardor ut non contenti agmine et corporibus in suggestu , in quo paulo ante aurea Galbae statua fuerat , medium inter signa Othonem vexillis circumdarent$$ There was now no doubt about the feeling of all the troops in the camp So great was their zeal ,  that ,  not content with surrounding Otho with their persons in close array ,  they elevated him to the pedestal ,  on which a short time before had stood the gilt statue of Galba ,  and there ,  amid the standards ,  encircled him with their colours
 nec tribunis aut centurionibus adeundi locus$$ Neither tribunes nor centurions could approach
 gregarius miles caveri insuper praepositos iubebat$$ The common soldiers even insisted that all the officers should be watched
 strepere cuncta clamoribus et tumultu et exhortatione mutua , non tamquam in populo ac plebe , variis segni adulatione vocibus , sed ut quemque adfluentium militum aspexerant , prensare manibus , complecti armis , conlocare iuxta , praeire sacramentum , modo imperatorem militibus , modo milites imperatori commendare , nec deerat Otho protendens manus adorare vulgum , iacere oscula et omnia serviliter pro dominatione$$ Everything was in an uproar with their tumultuous cries and their appeals to each other ,  which were not ,  like those of a popular assembly or a mob ,  the discordant expressions of an idle flattery on the contrary ,  as soon as they caught sight of any of the soldiers who were flocking in ,  they seized him ,  gave him the military embrace ,  placed him close to Otho ,  dictated to him the oath of allegiance ,  commending sometimes the Emperor to his soldiers ,  sometimes the soldiers to their Emperor Otho did not fail to play his part he stretched out his arms ,  and bowed to the crowd ,  and kissed his hands ,  and altogether acted the slave ,  to make himself the master
 postquam universa classicorum legio sacramentum eius accepit , fidens viribus , et quos adhuc singulos extimulaverat , accendendos in commune ratus pro vallo castorum ita coepit$$ It was when the whole legion from the fleet had taken the oath to him ,  that feeling confidence in his strength ,  and thinking that the men ,  on whose individual feeling he had been working ,  should be roused by a general appeal ,  he stood before the rampart of the camp ,  and spoke as follows 
 Quis ad vos processerim commilitones , dicere non possum , quia nec privatum me vocare sustineo princeps a vobis nominatus , nec principem alio imperante$$ Comrades ,  I cannot say in what character I have presented myself to you I refuse to call myself a subject ,  now that you have named me Prince ,  or Prince ,  while another reigns
 vestrum quoque nomen in incerto erit donec dubitabitur imperatorem populi Romani in castris an hostem habeatis$$ Your title also will be equally uncertain ,  so long as it shall be a question ,  whether it is the Emperor of the Roman people ,  or a public enemy ,  whom you have in your camp
 auditisne ut poena mea et supplicium vestrum simul postulentur$$ Mark you ,  how in one breath they cry for my punishment and for your execution
 adeo manifestum est neque perire nos neque salvos esse nisi una posse$$ So evident it is ,  that we can neither perish ,  nor be saved ,  except together
 et cuius lenitatis est Galba , iam fortasse promisit , ut qui nullo exposcente tot milia innocentissimorum militum trucidaverit$$ Perhaps ,  with his usual clemency ,  Galba has already promised that we should die ,  like the man ,  who ,  though no one demanded it ,  massacred so many thousands of perfectly guiltless soldiers
 horror animum subit quotiens recordor feralem introitum et hanc solam Galbae victoriam , cum in oculis urbis decimari deditos iuberet , quos deprecantis in fidem acceperat$$ A shudder comes over my soul ,  whenever I call to mind that ghastly entry ,  Galba's solitary victory ,  when ,  before the eyes of the capital he gave orders to decimate the prisoners ,  the suppliants ,  whom he had admitted to surrender
 his auspiciis urbem ingressus , quam gloriam ad principatum attulit nisi occisi Obultronii Sabini et Cornelii Marcelli in Hispania , Betui Cilonis in Gallia , Fontei Capitonis in Germania , Clodii Macri in Africa , Cingonii in via , Turpiliani in urbe , Nymphidii in castris$$ These were the auspices with which he entered the city What is the glory that he has brought to the throne None but that he has murdered Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius Marcellus in Spain ,  Betuus Chilo in Gaul ,  Fonteius Capito in Germany ,  Clodius Macer in Africa ,  Cingonius on the high road ,  Turpilianus in the city ,  Nymphidius in the camp
 quae usquam provincia , quae castra sunt nisi cruenta et maculata aut , ut ipse praedicat , emendata et correcta$$ What province ,  what camp in the world ,  but is stained with blood and foul with crime ,  or ,  as he expresses it himself ,  purified and chastened
 nam quae alii scelera , hic remedia vocat , dum falsis nominibus severitatem pro saevitia , parsimoniam pro avaritia , supplicia et contumelias vestras disciplinam appellat$$ For what others call crimes he calls reforms ,  and ,  by similar misnomers ,  he speaks of strictness instead of barbarity ,  of economy instead of avarice ,  while the cruelties and affronts inflicted upon you he calls discipline
 septem a Neronis fine menses sunt , et iam plus rapuit Icelus quam quod Polycliti et Vatinii et Aegiali perdiderunt$$ Seven months only have passed since Nero fell ,  and already Icelus has seized more than the Polycleti ,  the Vatinii ,  and the Elii amassed
 minore avaritia ac licentia grassatus esset Titus Vinius si ipse imperasset$$ Vinius would not have gone so far with his rapacity and lawlessness had he been Emperor himself
 nunc et subiectos nos habuit tamquam suos et vilis ut alienos$$ as it is ,  he has lorded it over us as if we had been his own subjects ,  has held us as cheap as if we had been another's
 una illa domus sufficit donativo quod vobis numquam datur et cotidie exprobratur$$ That one house would furnish the donative ,  which is never given you ,  but with which you are daily upbraided
 Ac ne qua saltem in successore Galbae spes esset accersit ab exilio quem tristitia et avaritia sui simillimum iudicabat$$ Again ,  that we might have nothing to hope even from his successor ,  Galba fetches out of exile the man in whose ill-humour and avarice he considers that he has found the best resemblance to himself
 vidistis , commilitones , notabili tempestate etiam deos infaustam adoptionem aversantis$$ You witnessed ,  comrades ,  how by a remarkable storm even the Gods discountenanced that ill-starred adoption
 idem senatus , idem populi Romani animus est$$ and the feeling of the Senate ,  of the people of Rome ,  is the same
 vestra virtus expectatur , apud quos omne honestis consiliis robur et sine quibus quamvis egregia invalida sunt$$ It is to your valour that they look ,  in you these better counsels find all their support ,  without you ,  noble as they may be ,  they are powerless
 non ad bellum vos nec ad periculum voco$$ It is not to war or to danger that I invite you
 omnium militum arma nobiscum sunt$$ the swords of all Roman soldiers are with us

 Iam exterritus Piso fremitu crebrescentis seditionis et vocibus in urbem usque resonantibus , egressum interim Galbam et foro adpropinquantem adsecutus erat$$ Meanwhile ,  appalled by the roar of the increasing sedition and by the shouts which reached the city ,  Piso had overtaken Galba ,  who in the interval had quitted the palace ,  and was approaching the Forum
 iam Marius Celsus haud laeta rettulerat , cum alii in Palatium redire , alii Capitolium petere , plerique rostra occupanda censerent , plures tantum sententiis aliorum contra dicerent , utque evenit in consiliis infelicibus , optima viderentur quorum tempus effugerat$$ Already Marius Celsus had brought back discouraging tidings And now some advised that the Emperor should return to the palace ,  others that he should make for the Capitol ,  many again that he should occupy the Rostra ,  though most did but oppose the opinions of others ,  while ,  as ever happens in these ill-starred counsels ,  plans for which the opportunity had slipped away seemed the best
 agitasse Laco ignaro Galba de occidendo Tito Vinio dicitur , sive ut poena eius animos militum mulceret , seu conscium Othonis credebat , ad postremum vel odio$$ It is said that Laco ,  without Galba's knowledge ,  meditated the death of Vinius ,  either hoping by this execution to appease the fury of the soldiers ,  or believing him to be an accomplice of Otho ,  or ,  it may be ,  out of mere hatred
 haesitationem attulit tempus ac locus , quia initio caedis orto difficilis modus$$ The time and the place however made him hesitate he knew that a massacre once begun is not easily checked
 et turbavere consilium trepidi nuntii ac proximorum diffugia , languentibus omnium studiis qui primo alacres fidem atque animum ostentaverant$$ His plan too was disconcerted by a succession of alarming tidings ,  and the desertion of immediate adherents So languid was now the zeal of those who had at first been eager to display their fidelity and courage
 Agebatur huc illuc Galba vario turbae fluctuantis impulsu , completis undique basilicis ac templis , lugubri prospectu$$ Galba was hurried to and fro with every movement of the surging crowd the halls and temples all around were thronged with spectators of this mournful sight
 neque populi aut plebis ulla vox , sed attoniti vultus et conversae ad omnia aures$$ Not a voice was heard from the people or even from the rabble Everywhere were terror-stricken countenances ,  and ears turned to catch every sound
 non tumultus , non quies , quale magni metus et magnae irae silentium est$$ It was a scene neither of agitation nor of repose ,  but there reigned the silence of profound alarm and profound indignation

 ire praecipitis et occupare pericula iubet$$ He ordered his men to hurry on at full speed ,  and to anticipate the danger

 nec illos Capitolii aspectus et imminentium templorum religio et priores et futuri principes terruere quo minus facerent scelus cuius ultor est quisquis successit$$ Neither the sight of the Capitol ,  nor the sanctity of the overhanging temples ,  nor the thought of rulers past or future ,  could deter them from committing a crime ,  which any one succeeding to power must avenge
 Titum inde Vinium invasere , de quo et ipso ambigitur consumpseritne vocem eius instans metus , an proclamaverit non esse ab Othone mandatum ut occideretur$$ They next fell on T Vinius and in his case also it is not known whether the fear of instant death choked his utterance ,  or whether he cried out that Otho had not given orders to slay him
 quod seu finxit formidine seu conscientiam coniurationis confessus est , huc potius eius vita famaque inclinat , ut conscius sceleris fuerit cuius causa erat$$ Either he invented this in his terror ,  or he thus confessed his share in the conspiracy His life and character incline us rather to believe that he was an accomplice in the crime which he certainly caused
 ante aedem divi Iulii iacuit primo ictu in poplitem , mox ab Iulio Caro legionario milite in utrumque latus transverberatus$$ He fell in front of the temple of the Divine Julius ,  and at the first blow ,  which struck him on the back of the knee immediately afterwards Julius Carus ,  a legionary ,  ran him through the body

 centurio is praetoriae cohortis , a Galba custodiae Pisonis additus , stricto pugione occurrens armatis et scelus exprobrans ac modo manu modo voce vertendo in se percussores quamquam vulnerato Pisoni effugium dedit$$ He was a centurion in a cohort of the Praetorian Guard ,  and had been appointed by Galba to escort Piso Rushing ,  dagger in hand ,  to meet the armed men ,  and upbraiding them with their crime ,  he drew the attention of the murderers on himself by his exclamations and gestures ,  and thus gave Piso ,  wounded as he was ,  an opportunity of escape
 Piso in aedem Vestae pervasit , exceptusque misericordia publici servi et contubernio eius abditus non religione nec caerimoniis sed latebra inminens exitium differebat , cum advenere missu Othonis nominatim in caedem eius ardentis Sulpicius Florus e Britannicis cohortibus , nuper a Galba civitate donatus , et Statius Murcus speculator , a quibus protractus Piso in foribus templi trucidatur$$ Piso made his way to the temple of Vesta ,  where he was admitted by the compassion of one of the public slaves ,  who concealed him in his chamber There ,  not indeed through the sanctity of the place or its worship ,  but through the obscurity of his hiding-place ,  he obtained a respite from instant destruction ,  till there came ,  by Otho's direction and specially eager to slay him ,  Sulpicius Florus ,  of the British auxiliary infantry ,  to whom Galba had lately given the citizenship ,  and Statius Murcus ,  one of the body-guard Piso was dragged out by these men and slaughtered in the entrance of the temple
 Nullam caedem Otho maiore laetitia excepisse , nullum caput tam insatiabilibus oculis perlustrasse dicitur , seu tum primum levata omni sollicitudine mens vacare gaudio coeperat , seu recordatio maiestatis in Galba , amicitiae in Tito Vinio quamvis immitem animum imagine tristi confuderat , Pisonis ut inimici et aemuli caede laetari ius fasque credebat$$ There was ,  we are told ,  no death of which Otho heard with greater joy ,  no head which he surveyed with so insatiable a gaze Perhaps it was ,  that his mind was then for the first time relieved from all anxiety ,  and so had leisure to rejoice perhaps there was with Galba something to recall departed majesty ,  with Vinius some thought of old friendship ,  which troubled with mournful images even that ruthless heart Piso's death ,  as that of an enemy and a rival ,  he felt to be a right and lawful subject of rejoicing
 praefixa contis capita gestabantur inter signa cohortium iuxta aquilam legionis , certatim ostentantibus cruentas manus qui occiderant , qui interfuerant , qui vere qui falso ut pulchrum et memorabile facinus iactabant$$ The heads were fixed upon poles and carried about among the standards of the cohorts ,  close to the eagle of the legion ,  while those who had struck the blow ,  those who had been present ,  those who whether truly or falsely boasted of the act ,  as of some great and memorable achievement ,  vied in displaying their bloodstained hands
 plures quam centum viginti libellos praemium exposcentium ob aliquam notabilem illa die operam Vitellius postea invenit , omnisque conquiri et interfici iussit , non honori Galbae , sed tradito principibus more munimentum ad praesens , in posterum ultionem$$ Vitellius afterwards found more than 120 memorials from persons who claimed a reward for some notable service on that day All these persons he ordered to be sought out and slain ,  not to honour Galba ,  but to comply with the traditional policy of rulers ,  who thus provide protection for the present and vengeance for the future
 Alium crederes senatum , alium populum$$ One would have thought it a different Senate ,  a different people

 caedis et praedarum initium et optimo cuique perniciem quaeri apparebat , sed Othoni nondum auctoritas inerat ad prohibendum scelus$$ It was evident that they were seeking to begin massacre and plunder ,  and the proscription of all the most virtuous citizens ,  and Otho had not yet sufficient authority to prevent crime ,  though he could command it
 iubere iam poterat ita simulatione irae vinciri iussum et maiores poenas daturum adfirmans praesenti exitio subtraxit$$ He feigned anger ,  and ordered him to be loaded with chains ,  declaring that he was to suffer more signal punishment ,  and thus he rescued him from immediate destruction

 diu infructuosam et asperam militiam toleraverant ingenio loci caelique et severitate disciplinae , quam in pace inexorabilem discordiae civium resolvunt , paratis utrimque corruptoribus et perfidia impunita$$ They had long endured a service which the character of the country and of the climate and the rigours of military discipline rendered at once unprofitable and severe But that discipline ,  inexorable as it is in times of peace ,  is relaxed by civil strife ,  when on both sides are found the agents of corruption ,  and treachery goes unpunished
 viri , arma , equi ad usum et ad decus supererant sed ante bellum centurias tantum suas turmasque noverant$$ They had men ,  arms and horses ,  more than enough for all purposes of utility and show ,  but before the war they had been acquainted only with the companies and squadrons of their own force ,  as the various armies were separated from each other by the limits of their respective provinces
 exercitus finibus provinciarum discernebantur tum adversus Vindicem contractae legiones , seque et Gallias expertae , quaerere rursus arma novasque discordias$$ But the legions ,  having been concentrated to act against Vindex ,  and having thus learnt to measure their own strength against the strength of Gaul ,  were now on the lookout for another war and for new conflicts

 accessit callide vulgatum , temere creditum , decimari legiones et promptissimum quemque centurionum dimitti$$ There was also a report ,  ingeniously spread and recklessly believed ,  to the effect that the legions were being decimated ,  and all the most energetic centurions dismissed

 infensa Lugdunensis colonia et pertinaci pro Nerone fide fecunda rumoribus$$ The reports from the capital were unfavourable ,  while the disaffection of the colony of Lugdunum ,  which obstinately adhered to Nero ,  gave rise to a multitude of rumours
 sed plurima ad fingendum credendumque materies in ipsis castris , odio metu et , ubi viris suas respexerant , securitate$$ But it was in the army itself ,  in its hatreds ,  its fears ,  and even in the security with which a review of its own strength inspired it ,  that there was the most abundant material for the exercise of imagination and credulity
 Sub ipsas superioris anni kalendas Decembris Aulus Vitellius inferiorem Germaniam ingressus hiberna legionum cum cura adierat$$ Just before December 1 in the preceding year ,  Aulus Vitellius had visited Lower Germany ,  and had carefully inspected the winter quarters of the legions

 nec consularis legati mensura sed in maius omnia accipiebantur$$ But he seemed a greater personage than a simple consular legate ,  and all his acts were invested with an unusual importance
 et ut Vitellius apud severos humilis , ita comitatem bonitatemque faventes vocabant , quod sine modo , sine iudicio donaret sua , largiretur aliena$$ Though sterner judges pronounced Vitellius to be a man of low tastes ,  those who were partial to him attributed to geniality and good nature the immoderate and indiscriminate prodigality ,  with which he gave away what was his own ,  and squandered what did not belong to him
 simul aviditate imperitandi ipsa vitia pro virtutibus interpretabantur$$ Besides this ,  men themselves eager for power were ready to represent his very vices as virtues
 multi in utroque exercitu sicut modesti quietique ita mali et strenui$$ As there were in both armies many of obedient and quiet habits ,  so there were many who were as unprincipled as they were energetic

 e quibus Valens infensus Galbae , tamquam detectam a se Verginii cunctationem , oppressa Capitonis consilia ingrate tulisset , instigare Vitellium , ardorem militum ostentans$$ One of these men ,  Valens ,  had taken offence against Galba ,  under the notion that he had not shewn proper gratitude for his services in discovering to him the hesitation of Verginius and crushing the plans of Capito

 quatiebatur his segne ingenium ut concupisceret magis quam ut speraret$$ You have only to open your arms ,  and to meet the advances of fortune
 At in superiore Germania Caecina , decorus iuventa , corpore ingens , animi immodicus , scito sermone , erecto incessu , studia militum inlexerat$$ These arguments roused the indolent temper of the man ,  yet roused him rather to wish than to hope for the throne Meanwhile however in Upper Germany Caecina ,  young and handsome ,  of commanding stature ,  and of boundless ambition ,  had attracted the favour of the soldiery by his skilful oratory and his dignified mien
 hunc iuvenem Galba , quaestorem in Baetica impigre in partis suas transgressum , legioni praeposuit mox compertum publicam pecuniam avertisse ut peculatorem flagitari iussit$$ This man had ,  when quaestor in Baetica ,  attached himself with zeal to the party of Galba ,  who had appointed him ,  young as he was ,  to the command of a legion ,  but ,  it being afterwards discovered that he had embezzled the public money ,  Galba directed that he should be prosecuted for peculation
 Caecina aegre passus miscere cuncta et privata vulnera rei publicae malis operire statuit$$ Caecina ,  grievously offended ,  determined to throw everything into confusion ,  and under the disasters of his country to conceal his private dishonour
 nec deerant in exercitu semina discordiae , quod et bello adversus Vindicem universus adfuerat , nec nisi occiso Nerone translatus in Galbam atque in eo ipso sacramento vexillis inferioris Germaniae praeventus erat et Treviri ac Lingones , quasque alias civitates atrocibus edictis aut damno finium Galba perculerat , hibernis legionum propius miscentur unde seditiosa colloquia et inter paganos corruptior miles$$ There were not wanting in the army itself the elements of civil strife The whole of it had taken part in the war against Vindex it had not passed over to Galba till Nero fell even then in this transference of its allegiance it had been anticipated by the armies of Lower Germany Besides this ,  the Treveri ,  the Lingones ,  and the other states which Galba had most seriously injured by his severe edicts and by the confiscation of their territory ,  were particularly close to the winter-quarters of the legions Thence arose seditious conferences ,  a soldiery demoralized by intercourse with the inhabitants of the country ,  and tendencies in favour of Verginius ,  which could easily be to the profit of any other person
 Miserat civitas Lingonum vetere instituto dona legionibus dextras , hospitii insigne$$ The Lingones ,  following an old custom ,  had sent presents to the legions ,  right hands clasped together ,  an emblem of friendship
 legati eorum in squalorem maestitiamque compositi per principia per contubernia modo suas iniurias , modo vicinarum civitatium praemia , et ubi pronis militum auribus accipiebantur , ipsius exercitus pericula et contumelias conquerentes accendebant animos$$ Their envoys ,  who had assumed a studied appearance of misery and distress ,  passed through the headquarters and the men's tents ,  and complaining ,  now of their own wrongs ,  now of the rewards bestowed on the neighbouring states ,  and ,  when they found the soldiers' ears open to their words ,  of the perils and insults to which the army itself was exposed ,  inflamed the passions of the troops
 nec procul seditione aberant cum Hordeonius Flaccus abire legatos , utque occultior digressus esset , nocte castris excedere iubet$$ The legions were on the verge of mutiny ,  when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered the envoys to depart ,  and to make their departure more secret ,  directed them to leave the camp by night
 inde atrox rumor , adfirmantibus plerisque interfectos , ac ni sibi ipsi consulerent , fore ut acerrimi militum et praesentia conquesti per tenebras et inscitiam ceterorum occiderentur obstringuntur in ter se tacito foedere legiones , adsciscitur auxiliorum miles , primo suspectus tamquam circumdatis cohortibus alisque impetus in legiones pararetur , mox eadem acrius volvens , faciliore inter malos consensu ad bellum quam in pace ad concordiam$$ Hence arose a frightful rumour ,  many asserting that the envoys had been killed ,  and that ,  unless the soldiers provided their own safety ,  the next thing would be ,  that the most energetic of their number ,  and those who had complained of their present condition ,  would be slaughtered under cover of night ,  when the rest of the army would know nothing of their fate The legions then bound themselves by a secret agreement Into this the auxiliary troops were admitted At first objects of suspicion ,  from the idea that their infantry and cavalry were being concentrated in preparation for an attack on the legions ,  these troops soon became especially zealous in the scheme
 Inferioris tamen Germaniae legiones sollemni kalendarum Ianuariarum sacramento pro Galba adactae , multa cunctatione et raris primorum ordinum vocibus , ceteri silentio proximi cuiusque audaciam expectantes , insita mortalibus natura , propere sequi quae piget inchoare$$ Yet it was to Galba that the legions of Lower Germany took the oath of fidelity annually administered on the first of January It was done ,  however ,  after long delay ,  and then only by a few voices from the foremost ranks ,  while the rest preserved an absolute silence ,  every one waiting for some bold demonstration from his neighbour ,  in obedience to that innate tendency of men ,  which makes them quick to follow where they are slow to lead
 sed ipsis legionibus inerat diversitas animorum$$ And even in the various legions there was a difference of feeling
 primani quintanique turbidi adeo ut quidam saxa in Galbae imagines iecerint$$ The soldiers of the 1st and of the 5th were so mutinous ,  that some of them threw stones at the images of Galba
 quinta decima ac sexta decima legiones nihil ultra fremitum et minas ausae initium erumpendi circumspectabant$$ The 15th and 16th legions ventured on nothing beyond uproar and threatening expressions
 at in superiore exercitu quarta ac duetvicensima legiones , isdem hibernis tendentes , ipso kalendarum Ianuariarum die dirumpunt imagines Galbae , quarta legio promptius , duetvicensima cunctanter , mox consensu$$ They were on the watch for something that might lead to an outbreak In the Upper army ,  however ,  the 4th and 13th legions ,  which were stationed in the same winter-quarters ,  proceeded on this same first of January to break in pieces the images of Galba ,  the 4th legion being foremost ,  the 18th shewing some reluctance ,  but soon joining with the rest
 ac ne reverentiam imperii exuere viderentur , senatus populique Romani oblitterata iam nomina sacramento advocabant , nullo legatorum tribunorumve pro Galba nitente , quibusdam , ut in tumultu , notabilius turbantibus$$ Not however to seem to throw off all their reverence for the Empire ,  they sought to dignify their oath with the now obsolete names of the Senate and people of Rome Not a single legate or tribune exerted himself for Galba some ,  as is usual in a tumult ,  were even conspicuously active in mutiny ,  though no one delivered anything like a formal harangue or spoke from a tribunal
 non tamen quisquam in modum contionis aut suggestu locutus$$ Indeed there was as yet no one to be obliged by such services
 Spectator flagitii Hordeonius Flaccus consularis legatus aderat , non compescere ruentis , non retinere dubios , non cohortari bonos ausus , sed segnis pavidus et socordia innocens$$ Hordeonius Flaccus ,  the consular legate ,  was present and witnessed this outrage ,  but he dared neither check the furious mutineers ,  nor keep the wavering to their duty ,  nor encourage the well affected
 quattuor centuriones duetvicensimae legionis , Nonius Receptus , Donatius Valens , Romilius Marcellus , Calpurnius Repentinus , cum protegerent Galbae imagines , impetu militum abrepti vinctique$$ Indolent and timid ,  he was reserved from guilt only by his sloth Four Centurions of the 18th legion ,  Nonius Receptus ,  Donatius Valens ,  Romilius Marcellus ,  Calpurnius Repentinus ,  striving to protect the images of Galba ,  were swept away by a rush of the soldiers and put in irons
 nec cuiquam ultra fides aut memoria prioris sacramenti , sed quod in seditionibus accidit , unde plures erant omnes fuere$$ After this no one retained any sense of duty ,  any recollection of his late allegiance ,  but ,  as usually happens in mutinies ,  the side of the majority became the side of all

 laeta primoribus civitatis , celebrata in vulgus Celsi salus ne militibus quidem ingrata fuit , eandem virtutem admirantibus cui irascebantur$$ The escape of Celsus gratified the leading men in the State ,  was generally praised by the people ,  and did not displease even the soldiers ,  who could not but admire the virtue which provoked their anger

 unde non alium pertinacius ad poenam flagitaverunt , diverso adfectu , quibus odium Neronis inerat et quibus desiderium$$ Hence there was no criminal ,  whose doom was from opposite motives more importunately demanded ,  as well by those who hated Nero ,  as by those who regretted him
 apud Galbam Titi Vinii potentia defensus , praetexentis servatam ab eo filiam$$ During the reign of Galba Tigellinus had been screened by the influence of Vinius ,  who alleged that he had saved his daughter
 haud dubie servaverat , non clementia , quippe tot interfectis , sed effugium in futurum , quia pessimus quisque diffidentia praesentium mutationem pavens adversus publicum odium privatam gratiam praeparat$$ And doubtless he had preserved her life ,  not indeed out of mercy ,  when he had murdered so many ,  but to secure for himself a refuge for the future For all the greatest villains ,  distrusting the present ,  and dreading change ,  look for private friendship to shelter them from public detestation ,  caring not to be free from guilt ,  but only to ensure their turn in impunity
 unde nulla innocentiae cura sed vices impunitatis$$ This enraged the people more than ever ,  the recent unpopularity of Vinius being superadded to their old hatred against Tigellinus
 eo infensior populus , addita ad vetus Tigellini odium recenti Titi Vinii invidia , concurrere ex tota urbe in Palatium ac fora et , ubi plurima vulgi licentia , in circum ac theatra effusi seditiosis vocibus strepere , donec Tigellinus accepto apud Sinuessanas aquas supremae necessitatis nuntio inter stupra concubinarum et oscula et deformis moras sectis novacula faucibus infamem vitam foedavit etiam exitu sero et inhonesto$$ They rushed from every part of the city into the palace and forum ,  and bursting into the circus and theatre ,  where the mob enjoy a special license ,  broke out into seditious clamours At length Tigellinus ,  having received at the springs of Sinuessa a message that his last hour was come ,  amid the embraces and caresses of his mistresses and other unseemly delays ,  cut his throat with a razor ,  and aggravated the disgrace of an infamous life by a tardy and ignominious death

 Crebrae interim et muliebribus blandimentis infectae ab Othone ad Vitellium epistulae offerebant pecuniam et gratiam et quemcumque e quietis prodigae vitae legisset$$ Meanwhile frequent letters ,  disfigured by unmanly flatteries ,  were addressed by Otho to Vitellius ,  with offers of wealth and favour and any retreat he might select for a life of prodigal indulgence

 Otho , revocatis quos Galba miserat legatis , rursus ad utrumque Germanicum exercitum et ad legionem Italicam easque quae Lugduni agebant copias specie senatus misit$$ Otho ,  having recalled the envoys whom Galba had sent ,  dispatched others ,  nominally from the Senate ,  to both the armies of Germany ,  to the Italian legion ,  and to the troops quartered at Lugdunum
 legati apud Vitellium remansere , promptius quam ut retenti viderentur$$ The envoys remained with Vitellius too readily to let it be supposed that they were detained
 praetoriani , quos per simulationem officii legatis Otho adiunxerat , remissi antequam legionibus miscerentur$$ Some Praetorians ,  whom Otho had attached to the embassy ,  ostensibly as a mark of distinction ,  were sent back before they could mix with the legions

 longinquae provinciae et quidquid armorum mari dirimitur penes Othonem manebat , non partium studio , sed erat grande momentum in nomine urbis ac praetexto senatus , et occupaverat animos prior auditus$$ The distant provinces ,  and all the armies beyond the sea ,  still adhered to Otho ,  not from any attachment to his party ,  but because there was vast weight in the name of the capital and the prestige of the Senate ,  and also because the claims which they had first heard had prepossessed their minds

 id principibus et nobilissimo cuique tegimen , ferreis lamminis aut praeduro corio consertum , ut adversus ictus impenetrabile ita impetu hostium provolutis inhabile ad resurgendum$$ These coats are worn as defensive armour by the princes and most distinguished persons of the tribe They are formed of plates of iron or very tough hides ,  and though they are absolutely impenetrable to blows ,  yet they make it difficult for such as have been overthrown by the charge of the enemy to regain their feet
 simul altitudine et mollitia nivis hauriebantur$$ Besides ,  the Sarmatians were perpetually sinking in the deep and soft snow
 Romanus miles facilis lorica et missili pilo aut lanceis adsultans , ubi res posceret , levi gladio inermem Sarmatam (neque enim scuto defendi mos est) comminus fodiebat , donec pauci qui proelio superfuerant paludibus abderentur$$ The Roman soldier ,  moving easily in his cuirass ,  continued to harass them with javelins and lances ,  and whenever the occasion required ,  closed with them with his short sword ,  and stabbed the defenceless enemy for it is not their custom to defend themselves with a shield

 fremit miles et tribunos centurionesque proditionis arguit , tamquam familiae senatorum ad perniciem Othonis armarentur , pars ignari et vino graves , pessimus quisque in occasionem praedarum , vulgus , ut mos est , cuiuscumque motus novi cupidum$$ many acted in ignorance and were stupefied by wine ,  the worst among them were seeking an opportunity for plunder ,  the mass was as usual ready for any new movement ,  and the military obedience of the better disposed was neutralised by the darkness The tribune ,  who sought to check the movement ,  and the strictest disciplinarians among the centurions ,  were cut down
 et obsequia meliorum nox abstulerat resistentem seditioni tribunum et severissimos centurionum obtruncant$$ The soldiers seized their arms ,  bared their swords ,  and ,  mounted on their horses ,  made for the city and the palace

 qui trepidi , fortuitusne militum furor an dolus imperatoris , manere ac deprehendi an fugere et dispergi periculosius foret , modo constantiam simulare , modo formidine detegi , simul Othonis vultum intueri$$ In their alarm they doubted whether this was a casual outbreak of the soldiers ,  or an act of treachery in the Emperor ,  and whether to remain and be arrested was a more perilous alternative than to disperse and fly At one time making a show of courage ,  at another betrayed by their terror ,  they still watched the countenance of Otho
 utque evenit inclinatis ad suspicionem mentibus , cum timeret Otho , timebatur$$ And ,  as it happened ,  so ready were all to suspect ,  Otho felt as much alarm as he inspired
 sed haud secus discrimine senatus quam suo territus et praefectos praetorii ad mitigandas militum iras statim miserat et abire propere omnis e convivio , iussit$$ Terrified no less by the Senate's critical position than by his own ,  he had forthwith despatched the prefects of the Praetorian Guard to allay the fury of the soldiery ,  and he now ordered all to leave the banquet without delay
 tum vero passim magistratus proiectis insignibus , vitata comitum et servorum frequentia , senes feminaeque per tenebras diversa urbis itinera , rari domos , plurimi amicorum tecta et ut cuique humillimus cliens , incertas latebras petivere$$ Then on all sides officers of state cast aside the insignia of office ,  and shunned the retinues of their friends and domestics aged men and women wandered in the darkness of night about the various streets of the city few went to their homes ,  most sought the houses of friends ,  or some obscure hiding-place in the dwelling of their humblest dependents
 Militum impetus ne foribus quidem Palatii coercitus quo minus convivium inrumperent , ostendi sibi Othonem expostulantes , vulnerato Iulio Martiale tribuno et Vitellio Saturnino praefecto legionis , dum ruentibus obsistunt$$ The rush of the soldiers was not even checked by the doors of the palace They burst in upon the banquet with loud demands that Otho should shew himself They wounded the tribune ,  Julius Martialis ,  and the prefect ,  Vitellius Saturninus ,  who sought to stem the torrent
 undique arma et minae , modo in centuriones tribunosque , modo in senatum universum , lymphatis caeco pavore animis , et quia neminem unum destinare irae poterant , licentiam in omnis poscentibus , donec Otho contra decus imperii toro insistens precibus et lacrimis aegre cohibuit , redieruntque in castra inviti neque innocentes$$ On every they brandished their swords ,  and menaced the centurions and tribunes at one moment ,  the whole Senate at another Their minds were maddened by a blind panic ,  and ,  unable to single out any one object for their fury ,  they sought for indiscriminate vengeance At last Otho ,  regardless of his imperial dignity ,  stood up on a couch ,  and by dint of prayers and tears contrived to restrain them
 postera die velut capta urbe clausae domus , rarus per vias populus , maesta plebs$$ Reluctant and guilty ,  they returned to the camp
 deiecti in terram militum vultus ac plus tristitiae quam paenitentiae$$ The next day the houses were closed as they might be in a captured city
 manipulatim adlocuti sunt Licinius Proculus et Plotius Firmus praefecti , ex suo quisque ingenio mitius aut horridius$$ Few of the citizens could be seen in the streets ,  the populace were dejected ,  the soldiers walked with downcast looks ,  and seemed gloomy rather than penitent
 finis sermonis in eo ut quina milia nummum singulis militibus numerarentur$$ Licinius Proculus and Plotius Firmus ,  the prefects ,  addressed the companies in the gentler or harsher terms that suited their respective characters
 tum Otho ingredi castra ausus$$ The end of these harangues was that 5000 sesterces were paid to each soldier
 atque illum tribuni centurionesque circumsistunt , abiectis militiae insignibus otium et salutem flagitantes$$ Then did Otho venture to enter the camp the tribunes and centurions surrounded him
 sensit invidiam miles et compositus in obsequium auctores seditionis ad supplicium ultro postulabat$$ They had thrown aside the insignia of their rank ,  and they demanded release from the toils and perils of service
 Otho , quamquam turbidis rebus et diversis militum animis , cum optimus quisque remedium praesentis licentiae posceret , vulgus et plures seditionibus et ambitioso imperio laeti per turbas et raptus facilius ad civile bellum impellerentur , simul reputans non posse principatum scelere quaesitum subita modestia et prisca gravitate retineri , sed discrimine urbis et periculo senatus anxius , postremo ita disseruit$$ Otho was aware how disturbed was the country ,  and how conflicting the feelings of the soldiery ,  the most respectable of whom cried out for some remedy for the existing licence ,  while the great mass delighted in riot and in an empire resting on popularity ,  and could be most easily urged to civil war by indulgence in tumult and rapine At the same time he reflected that power acquired by crime could not be retained by a sudden assumption of the moderation and of the dignity of former times ,  yet he was alarmed by the critical position of the capital and by the perils of the Senate
 neque ut adfectus vestros in amorem mei accenderem , commilitones , neque ut animum ad virtutem cohortarer (utraque enim egregie supersunt) , sed veni postulaturus a vobis temperamentum vestrae fortitudinis et erga me modum caritatis$$ Finally ,  he addressed the troops in these terms   Comrades ,  I am not come that I may move your hearts to love me ,  or that I may rouse your courage love and courage you have in superfluous abundance I am come to pray you to put some restraint on your valour ,  some check on your affection for me
 tumultus proximi initium non cupiditate vel odio , quae multos exercitus in discordiam egere , ac ne detrectatione quidem aut formidine periculorum$$ The origin of the late tumult is to be traced not to rapacity or disaffection ,  feelings which have driven many armies into civil strife ,  much less to any shrinking from ,  or fear of danger
 nimia pietas vestra acrius quam considerate excitavit$$ It was your excessive affection for me that roused you to act with more zeal than discretion
 nam saepe honestas rerum causas , ni iudicium adhibeas , perniciosi exitus consequuntur$$ For even honourable motives of action ,  unless directed by judgment ,  are followed by disastrous results
 imus ad bellum$$ We are now starting for a campaign
 num omnis nuntios palam audiri , omnia consilia cunctis praesentibus tractari ratio rerum aut occasionum velocitas patitur$$ Does the nature of things ,  does the rapid flight of opportunities ,  admit of all intelligence being publicly announced ,  of every plan being discussed in the presence of all
 tam nescire quaedam milites quam scire oportet$$ It is as needful that the soldiers should be ignorant of some things as that they should know others
 ita se ducum auctoritas , sic rigor disciplinae habet , ut multa etiam centuriones tribunosque tantum iuberi expediat$$ The general's authority ,  the stern laws of discipline ,  require that in many matters even the centurions and tribunes shall only receive orders
 si cur iubeantur quaerere singulis liceat , pereunte obsequio etiam imperium intercidit$$ If ,  whenever orders are given ,  individuals may ask questions ,  obedience ceases ,  and all command is at an end
 an et illic nocte intempesta rapientur arma$$ Will you in the field too snatch up your arms in the dead of night
 unus alterve perditus ac temulentus (neque enim pluris consternatione proxima insanisse crediderim) centurionis ac tribuni sanguine manus imbuet , imperatoris sui tentorium inrumpet$$ Shall one or two worthless and drunken fellows ,  for I cannot believe that more were carried away by the frenzy of the late outbreak ,  imbrue their hands in the blood of centurions and tribunes ,  and burst into the tent of their Emperor
 Et oratio ad perstringendos mulcendosque militum animos et severitatis modus (neque enim in pluris quam in duos animadverti iusserat) grate accepta compositique ad praesens qui coerceri non poterant$$ This speech ,  which was meant to touch and to calm the feelings of the soldiers ,  and the moderate amount of severity exercised (for Otho had ordered two and no more to be punished) ,  met with a grateful acceptance ,  and for the moment reduced to order men who could not be coerced
 non tamen quies urbi redierat$$ Yet tranquillity was not restored to the capital
 strepitus telorum et facies belli , et militibus ut nihil in commune turbantibus , ita sparsis per domos occulto habitu , et maligna cura in omnis , quos nobilitas aut opes aut aliqua insignis claritudo rumoribus obiecerat$$ there was still the din of arms and all the sights of war ,  and the soldiers ,  though they made no concerted disturbance ,  had dispersed themselves in disguise about private houses ,  and exercised a malignant surveillance over all whom exalted rank ,  or distinction of any kind ,  exposed to injurious reports
 Vitellianos quoque milites venisse in urbem ad studia partium noscenda plerique credebant$$ Many too believed that some of the soldiers of Vitellius had come to the capital to learn the feelings of the different parties
 unde plena omnia suspicionum et vix secreta domuum sine formidine$$ Hence everything was rife with suspicion ,  and even the privacy of the family was hardly exempt from fear
 sed plurimum trepidationis in publico , ut quemque nuntium fama attulisset , animum vultumque conversis , ne diffidere dubiis ac parum gaudere prosperis viderentur$$ It was however in public that most alarm was felt with every piece of intelligence that rumour brought ,  men changed their looks and spirits ,  anxious not to appear discouraged by unfavourable omens ,  or too little delighted by success
 coacto vero in curiam senatu arduus rerum omnium modus , ne contumax silentium , ne suspecta libertas$$ When the Senate was summoned to the Chamber ,  it was hard for them to maintain in all things a safe moderation
 et privato Othoni nuper atque eadem dicenti nota adulatio igitur versare sententias et huc atque illuc torquere , hostem et parricidam Vitellium vocantes , providentissimus quisque vulgaribus conviciis , quidam vera probra iacere , in clamore tamen et ubi plurimae voces , aut tumultu verborum sibi ipsi obstrepentes$$ Silence might seem contumacious ,  and frankness might provoke suspicion ,  and Otho ,  who had lately been a subject ,  and had used the same language ,  was familiar with flattery Accordingly ,  they discussed various motions on which they had put many constructions Vitellius they called a public enemy and a traitor to his country ,  the more prudent contenting themselves with hackneyed terms of abuse ,  though some threw out reproaches founded in truth ,  yet only did so in the midst of clamour ,  and when many voices were heard at once ,  drowning their own speech in a tumult of words
 Prodigia insuper terrebant diversis auctoribus vulgata$$ Prodigies which were now noised abroad from various sources increased men's terror
 investibulo Capitolii omissas habenas bigae , cui Victoria institerat , erupisse cella Iunonis maiorem humana speciem , statuam divi Iulii in insula Tiberini amnis sereno et immoto die ab occidente in orientem conversam , prolocutum in Etruria bovem , insolitos animalium partus , et plura alia rudibus saeculis etiam in pace observata , quae nunc tantum in metu audiuntur$$ It was said that in the porch of the Capitol the reins of the chariot ,  on which stood the goddess of Victory ,  had dropped from her hand ,  that from the chapel of Juno there had rushed forth a form greater than the form of man ,  that the statue of the Divine Julius ,  which stands on the island in the Tiber ,  had turned from the West to the East on a calm and tranquil day ,  that an ox had spoken aloud in Etruria ,  that strange births of animals had taken place ,  besides many other things ,  such as in barbarous ages are observed even during seasons of peace ,  but are now heard of only in times of terror
 sed praecipuus et cum praesenti exitio etiam futuri pavor subita inundatione Tiberis , qui immenso auctu proruto ponte sublicio ac strage obstantis molis refusus , non modo iacentia et plana urbis loca , sed secura eius modi casuum implevit$$ But an alarm greater than all ,  because it connected immediate loss with fears for the future ,  arose from a sudden inundation of the Tiber The river became vastly swollen ,  broke down the wooden bridge ,  was checked by the heap of ruins across the current ,  and overflowed not only the low and level districts of the capital ,  but also much that had been thought safe from such casualties
 rapti e publico plerique , plures in tabernis et cubilibus intercepti$$ Many were swept away in the streets ,  many more were cut off in their shops and chambers
 fames in vulgus inopia quaestus et penuria alimentorum$$ The want of employment and the scarcity of provisions caused a famine among the populace
 corrupta stagnantibus aquis insularum fundamenta , dein remeante flumine dilapsa$$ The poorer class of houses had their foundations sapped by the stagnant waters ,  and fell when the river returned to its channel
 utque primum vacuus a periculo animus fuit , id ipsum quod paranti expeditionem Othoni campus Martius et via Flaminia iter belli esset obstructum fortuitis vel naturalibus causis in prodigium et omen imminentium cladium vertebatur$$ When men's minds were no longer occupied by their fears ,  the fact ,  that while Otho was preparing for his campaign ,  the Campus Martius and the Via Flaminia ,  his route to the war ,  were obstructed by causes either fortuitous or natural ,  was regarded as a prodigy and an omen of impending disasters
 Otho lustrata urbe et expensis bello consiliis , quando Poeninae Cottiaeque Alpes et ceteri Galliarum aditus Vitellianis exercitibus claudebantur , Narbonensem Galliam adgredi statuit classe valida et partibus fida , quod reliquos caesorum ad pontem Mulvium et saevitia Galbae in custodia habitos in numeros legionis composuerat , facta et ceteris spe honoratae in posterum militiae$$ Otho ,  after publicly purifying the city and weighing various plans for the campaign ,  determined to march upon Gallia Narbonensis ,  as the passes of the Penine and Cottian Alps and all the other approaches to Gaul were held by the armies of Vitellius His fleet was strong and loyal to his cause ,  for he had enrolled in the ranks of the legion the survivors of the slaughter at the Milvian bridge ,  whom the stern policy of Galba had retained in custody ,  while to the rest he had held out hopes of a more honourable service for the future
 addidit classi urbanas cohortis et plerosque e praetorianis , viris et robur exercitus atque ipsis ducibus consilium et custodes$$ To the fleet he had added some city cohorts ,  and many of the Praetorians ,  the stay and strength of his army ,  who might at once advise and watch the generals

 peditum equitumque copiis Suetonius Paulinus , Marius Celsus , Annius Gallus rectores destinati , sed plurima fides Licinio Proculo praetorii praefecto$$ Suetonius Paullinus ,  Marius Celsus ,  and Annius Gallus ,  were appointed to command the infantry and cavalry The Emperor ,  however ,  placed most confidence in Licinius Proculus ,  prefect of the Praetorian Guard
 is urbanae militiae impiger , bellorum insolens , auctoritatem Paulini , vigorem Celsi , maturitatem Galli , ut cuique erat , criminando , quod facillimum factu est , pravus et callidus bonos et modestos anteibat$$ an active officer at home ,  without experience in war ,  he founded perpetual accusations on the high influence of Paullinus ,  on the energy of Celsus ,  on the mature judgment of Gallus ,  in fact ,  on each man's special excellence ,  a thing most easy to do
 Sepositus per eos dies Cornelius Dolabella in coloniam Aquinatem , neque arta custodia neque obscura , nullum ob crimen , sed vetusto nomine et propinquitate Galbae monstratus$$ About this time Cornelius Dolabella was banished to the Colonia Aquinas ,  but he was not kept in strict or secret custody it was not for any crime that he suffered he was marked out for suspicion by his ancient name and by his relationship to Galba
 multos e magistratibus , magnam consularium partem Otho non participes aut ministros bello , sed comitum specie secum expedire iubet , in quis et Lucium Vitellium , eodem quo ceteros cultu , nec ut imperatoris fratrem nec ut hostis$$ Many of the officers of state and a large proportion of the men of consular rank Otho ordered to accompany him to the field ,  not indeed to share or serve in the campaign ,  but to form a retinue Among them was Lucius Vitellius ,  whom Otho treated as he treated the rest ,  and not as though he were the brother either of an Emperor ,  or of an enemy
 igitur motae urbis curae$$ This roused the anxieties of the capital
 nullus ordo metu aut periculo vacuus$$ no rank was free from apprehension or peril
 primores senatus aetate invalidi et longa pace desides , segnis et oblita bellorum nobilitas , ignarus militiae eques , quanto magis occultare et abdere pavorem nitebantur , manifestius pavidi$$ The leading men of the Senate either suffered from the infirmities of age ,  or were enervated by a prolonged peace the nobility were indolent and had forgotten how to fight the Equestrian order knew nothing of service
 nec deerant e contrario qui amibitione stolida conspicua arma , insignis equos , quidam luxuriosos apparatus conviviorum et inritamenta libidinum ut instrumentum belli mercarentur$$ and the more they endeavoured to hide and repress their alarm the more evident was their terror On the other hand ,  there were some who with senseless ostentation purchased splendid arms and magnificent horses ,  and some who procured by way of equipments for the war the luxurious furniture of the banquet and other incentives to profligacy
 sapientibus quietis et rei publicae cura levissimus quisque et futuri improvidus spe vana tumens$$ The wise looked to the interests of peace and of the Commonwealth ,  while the giddy and those who were thoughtless of the future were inflated with idle hopes
 multi adflicta fide in pace anxii , turbatis rebus alacres et per incerta tutissimi$$ Many whose credit had been shaken in the years of peace regained their spirits amidst the confusions of the time ,  and found their best safety in revolution

 nam ex quo divus Augustus res Caesarum composuit , procul et in unius sollicitudinem aut decus populus Romanus bellaverat$$ Indeed from the time that the Divine Augustus consolidated the power of the Caesars ,  the wars of the Roman people had been in remote places ,  and had caused anxiety or brought honour to but one man

 mox vocata contione maiestatem urbis et consensum populi ac senatus pro se attollens , adversum Vitellianas partis modeste disseruit , inscitiam potius legionum quam audaciam increpans , nulla Vitellii mentione , sive ipsius ea moderatio , seu scriptor orationis sibi metuens contumeliis in Vitellium abstinuit , quando , ut in consiliis militiae Suetonio Paulino et Mario Celso , ita in rebus urbanis Galeri Trachali ingenio Othonem ut credebatur$$ Soon afterwards he summoned an assembly ,  and enlarged on the dignity of the capital and the unanimity of the Senate and people in his favour Of the party of Vitellius he spoke with moderation ,  charging the legions with ignorance rather than with crime ,  and making no mention of Vitellius himself This moderation was either his own ,  or was due to the writer of the speech ,  who ,  fearing for himself ,  abstained from invectives against Vitellius For Otho was believed to avail himself of the abilities of Galerius Trachalus in civil matters ,  just as he employed those of Celsus and Paullinus in war
 et erant qui genus ipsum orandi noscerent , crebro fori usu celebre et ad implendas populi auris latum et sonans$$ There were some who recognized the very style of speaking ,  which was well known from his constant pleading at the bar ,  and which sought to fill the popular ear with a copious and sonorous diction

 Titus Vespasianus , e Iudaea incolumi adhuc Galba missus a patre , causam profectionis officium erga principem et maturam petendis honoribus iuventam ferebat , sed vulgus fingendi avidum disperserat accitum in adoptionem$$ Titus Vespasian had been sent from Judaea by his father while Galba still lived ,  and alleged as a reason for his journey the homage due to the Emperor ,  and his age ,  which now qualified him to compete for office But the vulgar ,  ever eager to invent ,  had spread the report that he was sent for to be adopted
 materia sermonibus senium et orbitas principis et intemperantia civitatis , donec unus eligatur , multos destinandi$$ The advanced years and childless condition of the Emperor furnished matter for such gossip ,  and the country never can refrain from naming many persons until one be chosen
 augebat famam ipsius Titi ingenium quantaecumque fortunae capax , decor oris cum quadam maiestate , prosperae Vespasiani res , praesaga responsa , et inclinatis ad credendum animis loco ominum etiam fortuita$$ The report gained the more credit from the genius of Titus himself ,  equal as it was to the most exalted fortune ,  from the mingled beauty and majesty of his countenance ,  from the prosperous fortunes of Vespasian ,  from the prophetic responses of oracles ,  and even from accidental occurrences which ,  in the general disposition to belief ,  were accepted as omens
 ubi Corinthi , Achaiae urbe , certos nuntios accepit de interitu Galbae et aderant qui arma Vitellii bellumque adfirmarent , anxius animo paucis amicorum adhibitis cuncta utrimque perlustrat$$ At Corinth ,  the capital of Achaia ,  he received positive information of the death of Galba ,  and found men who spoke confidently of the revolt of Vitellius and of the fact of war In the anxiety of his mind ,  he sent a few of his friends ,  and carefully surveyed his position from both points of view
 si pergeret in urbem , nullam officii gratiam in alterius honorem suscepti , ac se Vitellio sive Othoni obsidem fore$$ He considered that if he should proceed to Rome ,  he should get no thanks for a civility intended for another ,  while his person would be a hostage in the hands either of Vitellius or of Otho
 sin rediret , offensam haud dubiam victoris , set incerta adhuc victoria et concedente in partis patre filium excusatum$$ that should he turn back ,  the conqueror would certainly be offended ,  but with the issue of the struggle still doubtful ,  and the father joining the party ,  the son would be excused
 sin Vespasianus rem publicam susciperet , obliviscendum offensarum de bello agitantibus$$ on the other hand ,  if Vespasian should assume the direction of the state ,  men who had to think of war would have to forget such causes of offence
 Conditorem templi regem Aeriam vetus memoria , quidam ipsius deae nomen id perhibent$$ The founder of the temple ,  according to old tradition ,  was king Aerias ,  though some represent this as the name of the goddess herself

 mox , ne honore nullo regium genus peregrinam stirpem antecelleret , ipsa quam intulerant scientia hospites cessere$$ Afterwards ,  that the royal family might not be without some superiority over the foreign stock ,  the strangers relinquished the craft which they had themselves introduced
 tantum Cinyrades sacerdos consulitur$$ The priest of the line of Cinyras is alone consulted

 Titus spectata opulentia donisque regum quaeque alia laetum antiquitatibus Graecorum genus incertae vetustati adfingit , de navigatione primum consuluit$$ Titus ,  after surveying the treasures ,  the royal presents ,  and the other objects which the antiquarian tendencies of the Greek arbitrarily connect with some uncertain past ,  first consulted the oracle about his voyage

 Profligaverat bellum Iudaicum Vespasianus , obpugnatione Hierosolymorum reliqua , duro magis et arduo opere ob ingenium montis et pervicaciam superstitionis quam quo satis virium obsessis ad tolerandas necessitates superesset$$ Vespasian had all but completed the Jewish war ,  and only the siege of Jerusalem now remained ,  an operation ,  the difficulty and arduousness of which was due ,  rather to the character of its mountain citadel and the perverse obstinacy of the national superstition ,  than to any sufficient means of enduring extremities left to the besieged
 tres , ut supra memoravimus , ipsi Vespasiano legiones erant , exercitae bello$$ As we have mentioned above ,  Vespasian himself had three legions inured to war
 quattuor Mucianus obtinebat in pace , sed aemulatio et proximi exercitus gloria depulerat segnitiam , quantumque illis roboris discrimina et labor , tantum his vigoris addiderat integra quies et inexperti belli$$ Mucianus had four under his command in his peaceful province Emulation ,  however ,  and the glory won by the neighbouring army had banished all tendency to sloth ,  and unbroken rest and exemption from the hardships of war had given them a vigour equivalent to the hardihood which the others had gained by their perils and their toils
 Vespasianus acer militiae anteire agmen , locum castris capere , noctu diuque consilio ac , si res posceret , manu hostibus obniti , cibo fortuito , veste habituque vix a gregario milite discrepans$$ Vespasian was an energetic soldier he could march at the head of his army ,  choose the place for his camp ,  and bring by night and day his skill ,  or ,  if the occasion required ,  his personal courage to oppose the foe His food was such as chance offered

 Mucianum e contrario magnificentia et opes et cuncta privatum modum supergressa extollebant aptior sermone , dispositu provisuque civilium rerum peritus$$ in short ,  but for his avarice ,  he was equal to the generals of old Mucianus ,  on the contrary ,  was eminent for his magnificence ,  for his wealth ,  and for a greatness that transcended in all respects the condition of a subject
 egregium principatus temperamentum , si demptis utriusque vitiis solae virtutes miscerentur$$ readier of speech than the other ,  he thoroughly understood the arrangement and direction of civil business
 ceterum hic Syriae , ille Iudaeae praepositus , vicinis provinciarum administrationibus invidia discordes , exitu demum Neronis positis odiis in medium consuluere , primum per amicos , dein praecipua concordiae fides Titus prava certamina communi utilitate aboleverat , natura atque arte compositus adliciendis etiam Muciani moribus$$ It would have been a rare combination of princely qualities ,  if ,  with their respective faults removed ,  their virtues only could have been united in one man Mucianus was governor of Syria ,  Vespasian of Judaea In the administration of these neighbouring provinces jealousy had produced discord between them ,  but on Nero's fall they had dropped their animosities and associated their counsels At first they communicated through friends ,  till Titus ,  who was the great bond of union between them ,  by representing their common interests had terminated their mischievous feud
 tribuni centurionesque et vulgus militum industria licentia , per virtutes per voluptates , ut cuique ingenium , adsciscebantur$$ He was indeed a man formed both by nature and by education to attract even such a character as that of Mucianus The tribunes ,  the centurions ,  and the common soldiers ,  were brought over to the cause by appeals to their energy or their love of license ,  to their virtues or to their vices ,  according to their different dispositions

 mox , ut Othonem ac Vitellium scelestis armis res Romanas raptum ire vulgatum est , ne penes ceteros imperii praemia , penes ipsos tantum servitii necessitas esset , fremere miles et viris suas circumspicere$$ But when it became notorious that Otho and Vitellius ,  opposed in impious strife ,  were ready to make a spoil of the Empire ,  the thought that others would engross the rewards of power ,  while they would have nothing left for themselves but a compulsory submission ,  made the soldiers murmur and take a survey of their own strength

 nam recens Galbae principatu censuerant patres , ut accusatorum causae noscerentur$$ The Senators indeed had recently ,  during the reign of Galba ,  passed a resolution ,  that cognizance should be taken of the cases of the informers

 nec mora proelio sed acies ita instructa ut pars classicorum mixtis paganis in collis mari propinquos exurgeret , quantum inter collis ac litus aequi loci praetorianus miles expleret , in ipso mari ut adnexa classis et pugnae parata conversa et minaci fronte praetenderetur$$ The conflict commenced without delay ,  the enemy's line of battle being so arranged ,  that part of the levies from the fleet ,  who had a number of rustics among their ranks ,  were posted on the slope of the hills which border on the coast ,  the Praetorians fully occupying the level ground between the hills and the shore ,  while on the sea was the fleet ,  moored to the land and ready for action ,  drawn up in line so as to present a formidable front
 Vitelliani , quibus minor peditum vis , in equite robur , Alpinos proximis iugis , cohortis densis ordinibus post equitem locant$$ The Vitellianists whose infantry was inferior ,  but who were strong in cavalry ,  stationed the mountaineers on the neighbouring heights ,  and their infantry in close ranks behind the cavalry
 Trevirorum turmae obtulere se hosti incaute , cum exciperet contra veteranus miles , simul a latere saxis urgeret apta ad iaciendum etiam paganorum manus , qui sparsi inter milites , strenui ignavique , in victoria idem audebant$$ The squadrons of the Treveri charged the enemy incautiously ,  and found themselves encountered in front by the veteran troops ,  while on the flanks they were also annoyed by showers of stones from the rustic band ,  who were skilful throwers ,  and who ,  mixed up as they were among the regular soldiers ,  whether cowardly or brave ,  were all equally bold in the moment of victory
 additus perculsis terror invecta in terga pugnantium classe$$ The general consternation of the Vitellianists was increased by a new alarm as the fleet attacked the rear of the combatants
 ita undique clausi , deletaeque omnes copiae forent ni victorem exercitum attinuisset obscurum noctis , obtentui fugientibus$$ By this movement they were hemmed in on all sides ,  and the whole force would have perished ,  had not the shades of night checked the advance of the victorious army ,  and covered the retreat of the vanquished
 Corsicam ac Sardiniam ceterasque proximi maris insulas fama victricis classis in partibus Othonis tenuit$$ Corsica ,  Sardinia ,  and the other islands of the neighbouring seas ,  were retained in the interests of Otho by the fame of these naval successes
 sed Corsicam prope adflixit Decumi Pacarii procuratoris temeritas , tanta mole belli nihil in summam profutura , ipsi exitiosa$$ Corsica ,  however ,  all but suffered fatal injury from the rash proceedings of Decumus Pacarius ,  the procurator ,  proceedings which in so gigantic a war could contribute nothing to the general result ,  and which only brought destruction upon their author
 namque Othonis odio iuvare Vitellium Corsorum viribus statuit , inani auxilio etiam si provenisset$$ In his hatred of Otho he resolved to support Vitellius with the whole strength of Corsica ,  an insignificant assistance even had the design succeeded

 sed ubi dilectum agere Pacarius et inconditos homines fatigare militiae muneribus occepit , laborem insolitum perosi infirmitatem suam reputabant$$ But when Pacarius began to enlist troops ,  and to weary with military duties an undisciplined population ,  disgusted with the unusual toil ,  they began to reflect upon their own weakness
 insulam esse quam incolerent , et longe Germaniam virisque legionum$$ The country which we inhabit ,  they said to themselves ,  is an island

 trucidati et comites$$ His associates were slaughtered with him
 capita ut hostium ipsi interfectores ad Othonem tulere$$ The perpetrators of the deed carried the heads of the slain to Otho ,  as being the heads of public enemies
 neque eos aut Otho praemio adfecit aut puniit Vitellius , in multa conluvie rerum maioribus flagitiis permixtos$$ but ,  lost among the crowd of greater criminals ,  in the vast confusion of events ,  they were neither rewarded by Otho nor punished by Vitellius
 Aperuerat iam Italiam bellumque transmiserat , ut supra memoravimus , ala Siliana , nullo apud quemquam Othonis favore , nec quia Vitellium mallent , sed longa pax ad omne servitium fregerat facilis occupantibus et melioribus incuriosos$$ Silius' Horse had now ,  as I have already related ,  opened the way into Italy ,  and transferred the war across the borders No one entertained any attachment to Otho ,  yet it was not because they preferred Vitellius   long years of peace had subdued them to any kind of servitude ,  had made them ready to submit to the first comer and careless about the better cause
 florentissimum Italiae latus , quantum inter Padum Alpisque camporum et urbium , armis Vitellii (namque et praemissae a Caecina cohortes advenerant) tenebatur$$ The wealthiest district of Italy ,  the broad plains and cities which lie between the Padus and the Alps ,  was now held by the troops of Vitellius for by this time the infantry sent on in advance by Caecina had also arrived

 quo successu Vitellianus miles non iam flumine aut ripis arcebatur$$ Elated by these successes the troops of Vitellius would no longer be restrained by the boundaries of the river's bank
 inritabat quin etiam Batavos transrhenanosque Padus ipse , quem repente contra Placentiam transgressi raptis quibusdam exploratoribus ita ceteros terruere ut adesse omnem Caecinae exercitum trepidi ac falsi nuntiarent$$ The very sight of the Padus excited the men from Batavia and the Transrhenane provinces Crossing the stream by a sudden movement ,  they advanced on Placentia ,  and seizing some reconnoiterers so terrified the rest ,  that ,  deceived by their alarm ,  they announced that the whole army of Caecina was at hand
 Certum erat Spurinnae (is enim Placentiam optinebat) necdum venisse Caecinam et , si propinquaret , coercere intra munimenta militem nec tris praetorias cohortis et mille vexillarios cum paucis equitibus veterano exercitui obicere sed indomitus miles et belli ignarus correptis signis vexillisque ruere et retinenti duci tela intentare , spretis centurionibus tribunisque quin prodi Othonem et accitum Caecinam clamitabant$$ Spurinna ,  who now held Placentia ,  was sure that Caecina had not yet arrived ,  and that ,  even were he approaching ,  he ought to keep his men within their fortifications ,  and not confront a veteran army with three Praetorian cohorts ,  a thousand veterans ,  and a handful of cavalry But the undisciplined and inexperienced soldiery seized their standards and colours ,  and rushed to the attack ,  brandishing their weapons in the face of their general when he sought to restrain them ,  and spurning from them the tribunes and centurions ,  and even crying out that Otho was betrayed and that Caecina had come by invitation
 fit temeritatis alienae comes Spurinna , primo coactus , mox velle simulans , quo plus auctoritatis inesset consiliis si seditio mitesceret$$ Spurinna associated himself with the rash movement which others had originated ,  at first acting under compulsion ,  but afterwards pretending to consent ,  in the hope that his counsels might have more influence should the mutinous spirit abate

 is labor urbano militi insolitus contundit animos$$ The labour ,  new as it was to the soldiery of the capital ,  broke their spirits
 tum vetustissimus quisque castigare credulitatem suam , metum ac discrimen ostendere si cum exercitu Caecina patentibus campis tam paucas cohortis circumfudisset$$ All the oldest among them began to inveigh against their own credulity ,  and to point out the difficulty and danger of their position ,  if on those open plains Caecina and his army were to surround their scanty forces
 iamque totis castris modesti sermones , et inserentibus se centurionibus tribunisque laudari providentia ducis quod coloniam virium et opum validam robur ac sedem bello legisset$$ By this time more temperate language was heard throughout the camp ,  and the tribunes and centurions ,  mixing with the troops ,  suggested commendations of the prudence of their general in selecting for the rallying point and basis of his operations a colony rich in military strength and resources
 ipse postremo Spurinna , non tam culpam exprobrans quam rationem ostendens , relictis exploratoribus ceteros Placentiam reduxit minus turbidos et imperia accipientis$$ Finally ,  Spurinna himself ,  not so much reproaching them with their error as exposing it by his arguments ,  conducted them all back to Placentia ,  except some scouts whom he left ,  in a less turbulent temper and more amenable to command
 solidati muri , propugnacula addita , auctae turres , provisa parataque non arma modo sed obsequium et parendi amor , quod solum illis partibus defuit , cum virtutis haud paeniteret$$ The walls were strengthened ,  battlements were added ,  and the towers were raised in height It was not only of the implements of war that provision and preparation were made ,  but of the spirit of subordination and the love of obedience
 At Caecina , velut relicta post Alpis saevitia ac licentia , modesto agmine per Italiam incessit$$ Caecina ,  who seemed to have left his cruelty and profligacy on the other side of the Alps ,  advanced through Italy with his army under excellent discipline
 ornatum ipsius municipia et coloniae in superbiam trahebant , quod versicolori sagulo , bracas barbarum tecgmen indutus togatos adloqueretur$$ The towns and colonies ,  however ,  found indications of a haughty spirit in the general's dress ,  when they saw the cloak of various colours ,  and the trews ,  a garment of foreign fashion ,  clothed in which he was wont to speak to their toga-clad citizens
 uxorem quoque eius Saloninam , quamquam in nullius iniuriam insignis equo ostroque veheretur , tamquam laesi gravabantur , insita mortalibus natura recentem aliorum felicitatem acribus oculis introspicere modumque fortunae a nullis magis exigere quam quos in aequo viderunt$$ And they resented ,  as if with a sense of personal wrong ,  the conduct of his wife Salonina ,  though it injured no one that she presented a conspicuous figure as she rode through their towns on horseback in a purple habit They were acting on the instincts of human nature ,  which prompt men to scrutinize with keen eyes the recent elevation of their fellows ,  and to demand a temperate use of prosperity from none more rigorously than from those whom they have seen on a level with themselves
 Caecina Padum transgressus , temptata Othonianorum fide per conloquium et promissa , isdem petitus , postquam pax et concordia speciosis et inritis nominibus iactata sunt , consilia curasque in obpugnationem Placentiae magno terrore vertit , gnarus ut initia belli provenissent famam in cetera fore$$ Caecina ,  after crossing the Padus ,  sought to tamper with the loyalty of the Othonianists at a conference in which he held out hopes of reward ,  and he was himself assailed with the same arts After the specious but meaningless names of peace and concord had been thus bandied to and fro ,  Caecina turned all his thoughts and plans on the capture of Placentia ,  making a formidable show of preparation ,  as he knew that according to the success of his opening operations would be the subsequent prestige of his arms
 Sed primus dies impetu magis quam veterani exercitus artibus transactus$$ The first day ,  however ,  was spent in a furious onset rather than in the skilful approaches of a veteran army
 aperti incautique muros subiere , cibo vinoque praegraves$$ Exposed and reckless ,  the troops came close under the walls ,  stupefied by excess in food and wine
 in eo certamine pulcherrimum amphitheatri opus , situm extra muros , conflagravit , sive ab obpugnatoribus incensum , dum faces et glandis et missilem ignem in obsessos iaculantur , sive ab obsessis , dum regerunt$$ In this struggle the amphitheatre ,  a most beautiful building ,  situated outside the walls ,  was burnt to the ground ,  possibly set on fire by the assailants ,  while they showered brands ,  fireballs ,  and ignited missiles ,  on the besieged ,  possibly by the besieged themselves ,  while they discharged incessant volleys in return
 municipale vulgus , pronum ad suspiciones , fraude inlata ignis alimenta credidit a quibusdam ex vicinis coloniis invidia et aemulatione , quod nulla in Italia moles tam capax foret$$ The populace of the town ,  always inclined to be suspicious ,  believed that combustibles had been purposely introduced into the building by certain persons from the neighbouring colonies ,  who viewed it with envious and jealous eyes ,  because there was not in Italy another building so capacious
 quocumque casu accidit , dum atrociora metuebantur , in levi habitum , reddita securitate , tamquam nihil gravius pati potuissent , maerebant$$ Whatever the cause of the accident ,  it was thought of but little moment as long as more terrible disasters were apprehended

 utrimque pudor , utrimque gloria et diversae exhortationes hinc legionum et Germanici exercitus robur , inde urbanae militiae et praetoriarum cohortium decus attollentium$$ the Othonianists busied themselves in preparing stakes and huge masses of stone and of lead and brass ,  with which to break and overwhelm the hostile ranks The shame of failure ,  the hope of renown ,  wrought on both armies
 illi ut segnem et desidem et circo ac theatris corruptum militem , hi peregrinum et externum increpabant$$ both were appealed to by different arguments on the one side they extolled the strength of the legions and of the army of Germany

 et Caecina pudore coeptae temere obpugnationis , ne inrisus ac vanus isdem castris adsideret , traiecto rursus Pado Cremonam petere intendit$$ Caecina ,  ashamed of the assault on which he had so rashly ventured ,  and unwilling ,  ridiculed and baffled as he was ,  to remain in the same position ,  again crossed the Padus ,  and resolved on marching to Cremona
 tradidere sese abeunti Turullius Cerialis cum compluribus classicis et Iulius Briganticus cum paucis equitum , hic praefectus alae in Batavis genitus , ille primipilaris et Caecinae haud alienus , quod ordines in Germania duxerat$$ As he was going ,  Turullius Cerialis with a great number of the levies from the fleet ,  and Julius Briganticus with a few troopers ,  gave themselves up to him Julius commanded a squadron of horse he was a Batavian Turullius was a centurion of the first rank ,  not unfriendly to Caecina ,  as he had commanded a company in Germany

 nec solum apud Caecinam , qui culpam in militem conferebat seditioni magis quam proelio paratum$$ Nor was this the case only among the troops of Caecina ,  who indeed laid all the blame upon his soldiers ,  more ready ,  as he said ,  for mutiny than for battle

 cohortes Batavorum , quas bello Neronis a quarta decima legione digressas , cum Britanniam peterent , audito Vitellii motu in civitate Lingonum Fabio Valenti adiunctas rettulimus , superbe agebant , ut cuiusque legionis tentoria accessissent , coercitos a se quartadecimanos , ablatam Neroni Italiam atque omnem belli fortunam in ipsorum manu sitam iactantes$$ I have already described how the Batavian cohorts who separated from the 14th legion during the Neronian war ,  hearing on their way to Britain of the rising of Vitellius ,  joined Fabius Valens in the country of the Lingones They behaved themselves insolently ,  boasting ,  as they visited the quarters of the several legions ,  that they had mastered the men of the 14th ,  that they had taken Italy from Nero ,  that the whole destiny of the war lay in their hands
 contumeliosum id militibus , acerbum duci$$ Such language was insulting to the soldiers ,  and offensive to the general
 corrupta iurgiis aut rixis disciplina$$ The discipline of the army was relaxed by the brawls and quarrels which ensued
 ad postremum Valens e petulantia etiam perfidiam suspectabat$$ At last Valens began to suspect that insolence would end in actual treachery
 Igitur nuntio adlato pulsam Trevirorum alam Tungrosque a classe Othonis et Narbonensem Galliam circumiri , simul cura socios tuendi et militari astu cohortis turbidas ac , si una forent , praevalidas dispergendi , partem Batavorum ire in subsidium iubet$$ When ,  therefore ,  intelligence reached him that the cavalry of the Treveri and the Tungrian infantry had been defeated by Otho's fleet ,  and that Gallia Narbonensis was blockaded ,  anxious at once to protect a friendly population ,  and ,  like a skilful soldier ,  to separate cohorts so turbulent and ,  while they remained united ,  so inconveniently strong ,  he directed a detachment of the Batavians to proceed to the relief of the province
 quod ubi auditum vulgatumque , maerere socii , fremere legiones$$ This having been heard and become generally known ,  the allies were discontented and the legions murmured
 orbari se fortissimorum virorum auxilio$$ We are being deprived ,  they said ,  of the help of our bravest men
 veteres illos et tot bellorum victores , postquam in conspectu sit hostis , velut ex acie abduci$$ Those veteran troops victorious in so many campaigns ,  now that the enemy is in sight ,  are withdrawn ,  so to speak ,  from the very field of battle
 si provincia urbe et salute imperii potior sit , omnes illuc sequerentur sin victoriae sanitas sustentaculum columen in Italia verteretur , non abrumpendos ut corpori validissimos artus$$ If indeed a province be of more importance than the capital and the safety of the Empire ,  let us all follow them thither ,  but if the reality ,  the support ,  the mainstay of success ,  centre in Italy ,  you must not tear ,  as it were ,  from a body its very strongest limbs
 Haec ferociter iactando , postquam immissis lictoribus Valens coercere seditionem coeptabat , ipsum invadunt , saxa iaciunt , fugientem sequuntur$$ In the midst of these fierce exclamations ,  Valens ,  sending his lictors into the crowd ,  attempted to quell the mutiny On this they attacked the general himself ,  hurled stones at him ,  and ,  when he fled ,  pursued him
 spolia Galliarum et Viennensium aurum , pretia laborum suorum , occultare clamitantes , direptis sarcinis tabernacula ducis ipsamque humum pilis et lanceis rimabantur$$ Crying out that he was concealing the spoil of Gaul ,  the gold of the men of Vienna ,  the hire of their own toils ,  they ransacked his baggage ,  and probed with javelins and lances the walls of the general's tent and the very ground beneath
 nam Valens servili veste apud decurionem equitum tegebatur$$ Valens ,  disguised in the garb of a slave ,  found concealment with a subaltern officer of cavalry
 tum Alfenus Varus praefectus castrorum , deflagrante paulatim seditione , addit consilium , vetitis obire vigilias centurionibus , omisso tubae sono , quo miles ad belli munia cietur$$ After this ,  Alfenius Varus ,  prefect of the camp ,  seeing that the mutiny was gradually subsiding ,  promoted the reaction by the following device He forbade the centurions to visit the sentinels ,  and discontinued the trumpet calls by which the troops are summoned to their usual military duties
 igitur torpere cuncti , circumspectare inter se attoniti et id ipsum quod nemo regeret paventes$$ Thereupon all stood paralysed ,  and gazed at each other in amazement ,  panic-stricken by the very fact that there was no one to direct them
 silentio , patientia , postremo precibus ac lacrimis veniam quaerebant$$ By their silence ,  by their submission ,  finally by their tears and entreaties ,  they craved forgiveness
 ut vero deformis et flens et praeter spem incolumis Valens processit , gaudium miseratio favor$$ But when Valens ,  thus unexpectedly preserved ,  came forward in sad plight ,  shedding tears ,  they were moved to joy ,  to pity ,  even to affection
 versi in laetitiam , ut est vulgus utroque immodicum , laudantes gratantesque circumdatum aquilis signisque in tribunal ferunt$$ Their revulsion to delight was just that of a mob ,  always extreme in either emotion They greeted him with praises and congratulations ,  and surrounding him with the eagles and standards ,  carried him to the tribunal
 ille utili moderatione non supplicium cuiusquam poposcit , ac ne dissimulans suspectior foret , paucos incusavit , gnarus civilibus bellis plus militibus quam ducibus licere$$ With a politic prudence he refrained from demanding capital punishment in any case yet ,  fearing that he might lay himself more open to suspicion by concealment of his feelings ,  he censured a few persons ,  well aware that in civil wars the soldiers have more license than the generals
 Munientibus castra apud Ticinum de adversa Caecinae pugna adlatum , et prope renovata seditio tamquam fraude et cunctationibus Valentis proelio defuissent$$ While they were fortifying a camp at Ticinum ,  the news of Caecina's defeat reached them ,  and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh from an impression that underhand dealing and delay on the part of Valens had kept them away from the battle
 nolle requiem , non expectare ducem , anteire signa , urgere signiferos$$ They refused all rest they would not wait for their general
 rapido agmine Caecinae iunguntur$$ they advanced in front of the standards ,  and hurried on the standard-bearers
 improspera Valentis fama apud exercitum Caecinae erat$$ After a rapid march they joined Caecina
 expositos se tanto pauciores integris hostium viribus querebantur , simul in suam excusationem et adventantium robur per adulationem attollentes , ne ut victi et ignavi despectarentur$$ The character of Valens did not stand well with Caecina's army They complained that ,  though so much weaker in numbers ,  they had been exposed to the whole force of the enemy ,  thus at once excusing themselves ,  and extolling ,  in the implied flattery ,  the strength of the new arrivals ,  who might ,  they feared ,  despise them as beaten and spiritless soldiers
 et quamquam plus virium , prope duplicatus legionum auxiliorumque numerus erat Valenti , studia tamen militum in Caecinam inclinabant , super benignitatem animi , qua promptior habebatur , etiam vigore aetatis , proceritate corporis et quodam inani favore$$ Though Valens had the stronger army ,  nearly double the number of legions and auxiliaries ,  yet the partialities of the soldiers inclined to Caecina ,  not only from the geniality of heart ,  which he was thought more ready to display ,  but even from his vigorous age ,  his commanding person ,  and a certain superficial attractiveness which he possessed
 hinc aemulatio ducibus$$ The result was a jealousy between the two generals
 Caecina ut foedum ac maculosum , ille ut tumidum ac vanum inridebant$$ Caecina ridiculed his colleague as a man of foul and infamous character
 sed condito odio eandem utilitatem fovere , crebris epistulis sine respectu veniae probra Othoni obiectantes , cum duces partium Othonis quamvis uberrima conviciorum in Vitellium materia abstinerent$$ Valens retorted with charges of emptiness and vanity But concealing their enmity ,  they devoted themselves to their common interest ,  and in frequent letters ,  without any thought of pardon ,  heaped all manner of charges upon Otho ,  while the Othonianist generals ,  though they had the most abundant materials for invective against Vitellius ,  refrained from employing them
 Sane ante utriusque exitum , quo egregiam Otho famam , Vitellius flagitiosissimam meruere , minus Vitellii ignavae voluptates quam Othonis flagrantissimae libidines timebantur$$ In fact ,  before the death of these two men (and it was by his death that Otho gained high renown ,  as Vitellius incurred by his the foulest infamy) ,  Vitellius with his indolent luxury was less dreaded than Otho with his ardent passions The murder of Galba had made the one terrible and odious ,  while no one reckoned against the other the guilt of having begun the war
 addiderat huic terrorem atque odium caedes Galbae , contra illi initium belli nemo imputabat$$ Vitellius with his sensuality and gluttony was his own enemy Otho ,  with his profligacy ,  his cruelty ,  and his recklessness ,  was held to be more dangerous to the Commonwealth
 Vitellius ventre et gula sibi inhonestus , Otho luxu saevitia audacia rei publicae exitiosior ducebatur$$ When Caecina and Valens had united their forces ,  the Vitellianists had no longer any reason to delay giving battle with their whole strength Otho deliberated as to whether protracting the war or risking an engagement were the better course
 Coniunctis Caecinae ac Valentis copiis nulla ultra penes Vitellianos mora quin totis viribus certarent Otho consultavit trahi bellum an fortunam experiri placeret$$ Then Suetonius Paullinus ,  thinking that it befitted his reputation ,  which was such that no one at that period was looked upon as a more skilful soldier ,  to give an opinion on the whole conduct of the war ,  contended that impatience would benefit the enemy ,  while delay would serve their own cause
 Tunc Suetonius Paulinus dignum fama sua ratus , qua nemo illa tempestate militaris rei callidior habebatur , de toto genere belli censere , festinationem hostibus , moram ipsis utilem disseruit$$ The entire army of Vitellius ,  he said ,  has already arrived Nor have they much strength in their rear ,  since Gaul is ready to rise ,  and to abandon the banks of the Rhine ,  when such hostile tribes are ready to burst in ,  would not answer his purpose
 exercitum Vitellii universum advenisse , nec multum virium a tergo , quoniam Galliae tumeant et deserere Rheni ripam inrupturis tam infestis nationibus non conducat$$ A hostile people and an intervening sea keep from him the army of Britain Spain is not over full of troops Gallia Narbonensis has been cowed by the attack of our ships and by a defeat
 Britannicum militem hoste et mari distineri$$ Italy beyond the Padus is shut in by the Alps ,  cannot be relieved from the sea ,  and has been exhausted by the passage of his army
 Hispanias armis non ita redundare$$ For that army there is no where any corn ,  and without supplies an army cannot be kept together
 provinciam Narbonensem incursu classis et adverso proelio contremuisse clausam Alpibus et nullo maris subsidio transpadanam Italiam atque ipso transitu exercitus vastam$$ Then the Germans ,  the most formidable part of the enemy's forces ,  should the war be protracted into the summer ,  will sink with enfeebled frames under the change of country and climate
 non frumentum usquam exercitui , nec exercitum sine copiis retineri posse$$ Many a war ,  formidable in its first impetuosity ,  has passed into nothing through the weariness of delay
 iam Germanos , quod genus militum apud hostis atrocissimum sit , tracto in aestatem bello , fluxis corporibus , mutationem soli caelique haud toleraturos multa bella impetu valida per taedia et moras evanuisse$$ We ,  on the other hand ,  have on all sides abundant resources and loyal adherents We have Pannonia ,  Moesia ,  Dalmatia ,  the East with its armies yet intact ,  we have Italy and Rome ,  the capital of the Empire ,  the Senate ,  and the people ,  names that never lose their splendour ,  though they may sometimes be eclipsed
 contra ipsis omnia opulenta et fida , Pannoniam Moesiam Dalmatiam Orientem cum integris exercitibus , Italiam et caput rerum urbem senatumque et populum , numquam obscura nomina , etiam si aliquando obumbrentur$$ We have the wealth of the State and of private individuals We have a vast supply of money ,  which in a civil war is a mightier weapon than the sword Our soldiers are inured to the climate of Italy or to yet greater heat
 publicas privatasque opes et immensam pecuniam , inter civilis discordias ferro validiorem$$ We have the river Padus on our front ,  and cities strongly garrisoned and fortified ,  none of which will surrender to the enemy ,  as the defence of Placentia has proved
 corpora militum aut Italiae sueta aut aestibus$$ Let Otho therefore protract the war
 obiacere flumen Padum , tutas viris murisque urbis , e quibus nullam hosti cessuram Placentiae defensione exploratum$$ In a few days the 14th legion ,  itself highly renowned ,  will arrive with the troops from Moesia
 proinde duceret bellum$$ He may then again consider the question ,  and should a battle be resolved on ,  we shall fight with increased strength
 Accedebat sententiae Paulini Marius Celsus$$ Marius Celsus acquiesced in the opinion of Paullinus
 idem placere Annio Gallo , paucos ante dies lapsu equi adflicto , missi qui consilium eius sciscitarentur rettulerant$$ and Annius Gallus ,  who a few days before had been seriously injured by the fall of his horse ,  was reported to agree by those who had been sent to ascertain his opinion
 Otho pronus ad decertandum$$ Otho was inclined to risk a decisive battle
 frater eius Titianus et praefectus praetorii Proculus , imperitia properantes , fortunam et deos et numen Othonis adesse consiliis , adfore conatibus testabantur , neu quis obviam ire sententiae auderet , in adulationem concesserant$$ His brother Titianus ,  and Proculus ,  the prefect of the Praetorian Guard ,  ignorant and therefore impatient ,  declared that fortune ,  the Gods ,  and the genius of Otho ,  were with their counsels ,  and would be with their enterprises That no one might dare to oppose their views ,  they had taken refuge in flattery
 postquam pugnari placitum , interesse pugnae imperatorem an seponi melius foret dubitavere$$ It having been resolved to give battle ,  it became a question whether it would be better for the Emperor to be present in person ,  or to withdraw
 Paulino et Celso iam non adversantibus , ne principem obiectare periculis viderentur idem illi deterioris consilii auctores perpulere ut Brixellum concederet ac dubiis proeliorum exemptus summae rerum et imperii se ipsum reservaret$$ Paullinus and Celsus no longer opposed ,  for they would not seem to put the Emperor in the way of peril ,  and these same men who suggested the baser policy prevailed on him to retire to Brixellum ,  and thus secure from the hazards of the field ,  to reserve himself for the administration of empire
 is primus dies Othonianas partis adflixit$$ That day first gave the death-blow to the party of Otho
 namque et cum ipso praetoriarum cohortium et speculatorum equitumque valida manus discessit , et remanentium fractus animus , quando suspecti duces et Otho , cui uni apud militem fides , dum et ipse non nisi militibus credit , imperia ducum in incerto reliquerat$$ Not only did a strong detachment of the Praetorian cohorts ,  of the bodyguard ,  and of the cavalry ,  depart with him ,  but the spirit of those who remained was broken ,  for the men suspected their generals ,  and Otho ,  who alone had the confidence of the soldiers ,  while he himself trusted in none but them ,  had left the generals' authority on a doubtful footing
 Nihil eorum Vitellianos fallebat , crebris , ut in civili bello , transfugiis et exploratores cura diversa sciscitandi sua non occultabant$$ Nothing of this escaped the Vitellianists ,  for ,  as is usual in civil wars ,  there were many deserters ,  and the spies ,  while busy in inquiring into the plans of the enemy ,  failed to conceal their own
 quieti intentique Caecina ac Valens , quando hostis imprudentia rueret , quod loco sapientiae est , alienam stultitiam opperiebantur , inchoato ponte transitum Padi simulantes adversus obpositam gladiatorum manum , ac ne ipsorum miles segne otium tereret$$ Meanwhile Caecina and Valens remained quiet ,  and watched intently for the moment when the enemy in his blindness should rush upon destruction ,  and found the usual substitute for wisdom in waiting for the folly of others They began to form a bridge ,  making a feint of crossing the Padus ,  in the face of an opposing force of gladiators
 naves pari inter se spatio , validis utrimque trabibus conexae , adversum in flumen dirigebantur , iactis super ancoris quae firmitatem pontis continerent , sed ancorarum funes non extenti fluitabant , ut augescente flumine inoffensus ordo navium attolleretur claudebat pontem imposita turris et in extremam navem educta , unde tormentis ac machinis hostes propulsarentur$$ they wished also to keep their own soldiers from passing their unoccupied time in idleness Boats were ranged at equal distances from each other ,  connected at both ends by strong beams ,  and with their heads turned against the current ,  while anchors were thrown out above to keep the bridge firm The cables ,  however ,  instead of being taut ,  hung loose in the water ,  in order that as the stream rose the vessels might rise without their arrangement being disturbed On the end of the bridge was placed a turret
 Othoniani in ripa turrim struxerant saxaque et faces iaculabantur$$ it was built out on the last boat ,  and from it engines and machines might be worked to repel the enemy
 Et erat insula amne medio , in quam gladiatores navibus molientes , Germani nando praelabebantur$$ In the middle of the river was an island While the gladiators were making their way to it in boats ,  the Germans swam and outstripped them
 ac forte pluris transgressos completis Liburnicis per promptissimos gladiatorum Macer adgreditur$$ A considerable number ,  as it chanced ,  had effected the passage ,  when Macer ,  having manned some light gallies ,  attacked them with the most active of his gladiators
 sed neque ea constantia gladiatoribus ad proelia quae militibus , nec proinde nutantes e navibus quam stabili gradu e ripa vulnera derigebant$$ But the gladiator has not in battle the firmness of the regular soldier ,  and now ,  as they stood on rocking vessels ,  they could not direct their blows like men who had a sure footing on land
 et cum variis trepidantium inclinationibus mixti remiges propugnatoresque turbarentur , desilire in vada ultro Germani , retentare puppis , scandere foros aut comminus mergere$$ As the men in their alarm made confused movements ,  rowers and combatants were mingled together in disorder upon this ,  the Germans themselves leapt into the shallows ,  laid hold of the boats ,  climbed over the gunwales ,  or sank them with their hands
 quae cuncta in oculis utriusque exercitus quanto laetiora Vitellianis , tanto acrius Othoniani causam auctoremque cladis detestabantur$$ All this passed in the sight of both armies ,  and the more it delighted the Vitellianists ,  the more vehemently did the Othonianists curse the cause and author of the disaster
 Et proelium quidem , abruptis quae supererant navibus , fuga diremptum$$ The conflict was terminated by the flight of the vanquished ,  who carried off what boats were left
 Macer ad exitium poscebatur , iamque vulneratum eminus lancea strictis gladiis invaserant , cum intercursu tribunorum centurionumque protegitur$$ Then they cried out for the execution of Macer He had been wounded by a javelin thrown from a distance ,  and the soldiers had made a rush upon him with drawn swords ,  when he was saved by the interference of the tribunes and centurions
 nec multo post Vestricius Spurinna iussu Othonis , relicto Placentiae modico praesidio , cum cohortibus subvenit$$ Soon after Vestricius Spurinna ,  having received orders to that effect from Otho ,  joined with his cohorts ,  leaving but a moderate force in garrison at Placentia
 dein Flavium Sabinum consulem designatum Otho rectorem copiis misit , quibus Macer praefuerat , laeto milite ad mutationem ducum et ducibus ob crebras seditiones tam infestam militiam aspernantibus$$ After this Otho sent Flavius Sabinus ,  consul elect ,  to take the command of the troops which had been under Macer the soldiers were delighted by this change of generals ,  while the generals were led by these continual outbreaks to regard with disgust so hateful a service
 Invenio apud quosdam auctores pavore belli seu fastidio utriusque principis , quorum flagitia ac dedecus apertiore in dies fama noscebantur , dubitasse exercitus num posito certamine vel ipsi in medium consultarent , vel senatui permitterent legere imperatorem , atque eo duces Othonianos spatium ac moras suasisse , praecipua spe Paulini , quod vetustissimus consularium et militia clarus gloriam nomenque Britannicis expeditionibus meruisset$$ I find it stated by some authors that either the dread of or the disgust felt for both Emperors ,  whose wickedness and infamy were coming out every day into more open notoriety ,  made the two armies hesitate whether they should not cease their strife ,  and either themselves consult together ,  or allow the Senate to choose an Emperor and that ,  for this reason ,  Otho's generals recommended a certain measure of delay ,  Paullinus especially entertaining hopes for himself ,  on the ground that he was the senior among the men of consular rank ,  that he was well known as a soldier ,  and had attained great distinction and fame by his campaigns in Britain
 ego ut concesserim apud paucos tacito voto quietem pro discordia , bonum et innocentem principem pro pessimis ac flagitiosissimis expetitum , ita neque Paulinum , qua prudentia fuit , sperasse corruptissimo saeculo tantam vulgi moderationem reor ut qui pacem belli amore turbaverant , bellum pacis caritate deponerent , neque aut exercitus linguis moribusque dissonos in hunc consensum potuisse coalescere , aut legatos ac duces magna ex parte luxus egestatis scelerum sibi conscios nisi pollutum obstrictumque meritis suis principem passuros$$ Though I would allow that there were some few who in their secret wishes prayed for peace in the stead of disorder ,  for a worthy and blameless Emperor in the room of men utterly worthless and wicked ,  yet I cannot suppose that Paullinus ,  wise as he was ,  could have hoped in an age thoroughly depraved to find such moderation in the common herd ,  as that men ,  who in their passion for war had trampled peace under foot ,  should now in their affection for peace renounce the charms of war nor can I think that armies differing in language and in character ,  could have united in such an agreement or that lieutenants and generals ,  who were for the most part burdened by the consciousness of profligacy ,  of poverty ,  and of crime ,  could have endured any Emperor who was not himself stained by vice ,  as well as bound by obligation to themselves
 Vetus ac iam pridem insita mortalibus potentiae cupido cum imperii magnitudine adolevit erupitque$$ That old passion for power which has been ever innate in man increased and broke out as the Empire grew in greatness
 nam rebus modicis aequalitas facile habebatur$$ In a state of moderate dimensions equality was easily preserved
 sed ubi subacto orbe et aemulis urbibus regibusve excisis securas opes concupiscere vacuum fuit , prima inter patres plebemque certamina exarsere$$ but when the world had been subdued ,  when all rival kings and cities had been destroyed ,  and men had leisure to covet wealth which they might enjoy in security ,  the early conflicts between the patricians and the people were kindled into flame
 modo turbulenti tribuni , modo consules praevalidi , et in urbe ac foro temptamenta civilium bellorum$$ At one time the tribunes were factious ,  at another the consuls had unconstitutional power
 mox e plebe infima Gaius Marius et nobilium saevissimus Lucius Sulla victam armis libertatem in dominationem verterunt$$ it was in the capital and the forum that we first essayed civil wars Then rose C Marius ,  sprung from the very dregs of the populace ,  and L
 post quos Gnaeus Pompeius occultior non melior , et numquam postea nisi de principatu quaesitum$$ Sulla ,  the most ruthless of the patricians ,  who perverted into absolute dominion the liberty which had yielded to their arms
 non discessere ab armis in Pharsalia ac Philippis civium legiones , nedum Othonis ac Vitellii exercitus sponte posituri bellum fuerint$$ After them came Cn Pompeius ,  with a character more disguised but no way better Henceforth men's sole object was supreme power
 eadem illos deum ira , eadem hominum rabies , eaedem scelerum causae in discordiam egere$$ Legions formed of Roman citizens did not lay down their arms at Pharsalia and Philippi ,  much less were the armies of Otho and Vitellius likely of their own accord to abandon their strife
 quod singulis velut ictibus transacta sunt bella , ignavia principum factum est$$ They were driven into civil war by the same wrath from heaven ,  the same madness among men ,  the same incentives to crime
 sed me veterum novorumque morum reputatio longius tulit$$ That these wars were terminated by what we may call single blows ,  was owing to want of energy in the chiefs
 nunc ad rerum ordinem venio$$ But these reflections on the character of ancient and modern times have carried me too far from my subject
 Non ut ad pugnam sed ad bellandum profecti confluentis Padi et Ardae fluminum , sedecim inde milium spatio distantis , petebant$$ They started for a campaign rather than for a battle ,  making for the confluence of the Padus and Addua ,  a distance of sixteen miles from their position
 Celso et Paulino abnuentibus militem itinere fessum , sarcinis gravem obicere hosti , non omissuro quo minus expeditus et vix quattuor milia passuum progressus aut incompositos in agmine aut dispersos et vallum molientis adgrederetur , Titianus et Proculus , ubi consiliis vincerentur , ad ius imperii transibant$$ Celsus and Paullinus remonstrated against exposing troops wearied with a march and encumbered with baggage to any enemy ,  who ,  being himself ready for action and having marched barely four miles ,  would not fail to attack them ,  either when they were in the confusion of an advance ,  or when they were dispersed and busy with the work of entrenchment Titianus and Proculus ,  overcome in argument ,  fell back on the Imperial authority
 aderat sane citus equo Numida cum atrocibus mandatis , quibus Otho increpita ducum segnitia rem in discrimen mitti iubebat , aeger mora et spei impatiens$$ It was true that a Numidian had arrived at full gallop with an angry message from Otho ,  in which the Emperor ,  sick of delay and impatient of suspense ,  sharply rebuked the inactivity of the generals ,  and commanded that matters should be brought to an issue
 Eodem die ad Caecinam operi pontis intentum duo praetoriarum cohortium tribuni , conloquium eius postulantes , venerunt$$ The same day ,  while Caecina was engaged on the construction of a bridge ,  two tribunes of the Praetorian Guard came to him and begged an interview
 audire condiciones ac reddere parabat , cum praecipites exploratores adesse hostem nuntiavere$$ He was on the point of hearing their proposals and sending back his own ,  when the scouts arrived at headlong speed with the news that the enemy were close at hand
 interruptus tribunorum sermo , eoque incertum fuit insidias an proditionem vel aliquod honestum consilium coeptaverint$$ The address of the tribunes was thus abruptly terminated Thus it remained uncertain whether deception ,  or treason ,  or some honourable arrangement ,  had been in their thoughts
 Caecina dimissis tribunis revectus in castra datum iussu Fabii Valentis pugnae signum et militem in armis invenit$$ Caecina dismissed the tribunes and rode back to the camp There he found that Fabius Valens had given the signal for battle ,  and that the troops were under arms
 dum legiones de ordine agminis sortiuntur , equites prorupere et mirum dictu , a paucioribus Othonianis quo minus in vallum inpingerentur , Italicae legionis virtute deterriti sunt$$ While the legions were casting lots for the order of march ,  the cavalry charged ,  and ,  strange to say ,  were kept only by the courage of the Italian legion from being driven back on the entrenchments by an inferior force of Othonianists
 ea strictis mucronibus redire pulsos et pugnam resumere coegit$$ These men ,  at the sword's point ,  compelled the beaten squadron to wheel round and resume the conflict
 disposita Vitellianarum legionum acies sine trepidatione$$ The line of the Vitellianists was formed without hurry ,  for ,  though the enemy was close at hand ,  the sight of their arms was intercepted by the thick brushwood
 etenim quamquam vicino hoste aspectus armorum densis arbustis prohibebatur$$ In Otho's army the generals were full of fear ,  and the soldiers hated their officers
 apud Othonianos pavidi duces , miles ducibus infensus , mixta vehicula et lixae , et praeruptis utrimque fossis via quieto quoque agmini angusta$$ the baggage-wagons and the camp-followers were mingled with the troops and as there were steep ditches on both sides the road ,  it would have been found too narrow even for an undisturbed advance
 circumsistere alii signa sua , quaerere alii$$ Some were gathering round their standards
 incertus undique clamor adcurrentium , vocantium$$ others were seeking them
 ut cuique audacia vel formido , in primam postremamve aciem prorumpebant aut relabebantur$$ everywhere was heard the confused shouting of men who were joining the ranks ,  or calling to their comrades ,  and each ,  as he was prompted by courage or by cowardice ,  rushed on to the front ,  or slunk back to the rear
 Forte inter Padum viamque patenti campo duae legiones congressae sunt , pro Vitellio unaetvicensima , cui cognomen Rapaci , vetere gloria insignis , e parte Othonis prima Adiutrix , non ante in aciem deducta , sed ferox et novi decoris avida$$ In an open plain between the Padus and the road ,  two legions happened to meet On the side of Vitellius was the 21st ,  called the Rapax ,  a corps of old and distinguished renown On that of Otho was the 1st ,  called Adjutrix ,  which had never before been brought into the field ,  but was high-spirited ,  and eager to gain its first triumph
 primani stratis unaetvicensimanorum principiis aquilam abstulere$$ The men of the 1st ,  overthrowing the foremost ranks of the 21st ,  carried off the eagle

 exitiabile id rei publicae , ingratum militi , cui eadem munia inter paucos periculaque ac labor crebrius redibant$$ This measure was disastrous to the State ,  and distasteful to the soldier ,  who found that the same duty was distributed among a smaller number ,  and that his toils and risks came round in a more frequent succession
 et vires luxu corrumpebantur , contra veterem disciplinam et instituta maiorum apud quos virtute quam pecunia res Romana melius stetit$$ Their vigour too was undermined by luxury ,  a luxury that transgressed our ancient discipline and the customs of our ancestors ,  in whose days the power of Rome found a surer foundation in valour than in wealth

 ut Valenti et Caecinae vacuos honoris mensis aperiret , coartati aliorum consulatus , dissimulatus Marci Macri tamquam Othonianarum partium ducis$$ To leave some months of office open for Valens and Caecina ,  the consulates of others were abridged ,  that of Martius Macer was ignored on the ground of his having been one of Otho's generals

 igitur deterrimo quoque in argumentum fabulae adsumpto vulgus credulum et quidam militum , errore veri seu turbarum studio , certatim adgregabantur , cum pertractus ad Vitellium interrogatusque quisnam mortalium esset postquam nulla dictis fides et a domino noscebatur condicione fugitivus , nomine Geta , sumptum de eo supplicium in servilem modum$$ He admitted into the secret of his imposture all the most worthless of his followers and the credulous populace and some of the soldiers ,  either from not knowing the truth ,  or impatient for revolution ,  began eagerly to rally round him When he was brought before Vitellius ,  and asked who he was ,  as his account of himself could not be trusted ,  ,  and his master recognised him as a runaway slave ,  by name Geta ,  he was executed as slaves usually are

 namque omnis exercitus flammaverat adrogantia venientium a Vitellio militum , quod truces corpore , horridi sermone ceteros ut imparis inridebant$$ In fact the whole army had been kindled into indignation by the insolence of the soldiers who came among them from Vitellius Savage in appearance ,  and speaking a rude dialect ,  they ridiculed everybody else as their inferiors
 sed in tanta mole belli plerumque cunctatio$$ But in such gigantic preparations for war there is usually delay

 ego te , Vespasiane , ad imperium voco , quam salutare rei publicae , quam tibi magnificum , iuxta deos in tua manu positum est$$ I invite you ,  Vespasian ,  to a dignity which will be as beneficial to the State ,  as it will be honourable to yourself

 non adversus divi Augusti acerrimam mentem nec adversus cautissimam Tiberii senectutem , ne contra Gai quidem aut Claudii vel Neronis fundatam longo imperio domum exurgimus$$ To be chosen successor to Vitellius would be more of an insult than a compliment It is not against the vigorous intellect of the Divine Augustus ,  it is not against the profound subtlety of the aged Tiberius ,  it is not even against the house of Caius ,  Claudius ,  or Nero ,  established by a long possession of the Empire ,  that we are rising in revolt

 munia imperii Caecina ac Valens obibant , olim anxii odiis , quae bello et castris male dissimulata pravitas amicorum et fecunda gignendis inimicitiis civitas auxerat , dum ambitu comitatu et immensis salutantium agminibus contendunt comparanturque , variis in hunc aut illum Vitellii inclinationibus$$ The functions of Empire were discharged by Caecina and Valens They had long before been led to suspect each other by animosities scarcely concealed amid the cares of the campaign and the camp ,  and aggravated by unprincipled friends and a state of society calculated to produce such feuds In their struggles for popularity ,  in their long retinues ,  and in the vast crowds at their levees ,  they vied with each other and challenged comparison ,  while the favour of Vitellius inclined first to one ,  and then to the other
 nec umquam satis fida potentia , ubi nimia est$$ There can never be complete confidence in a power which is excessive
 simul ipsum Vitellium , subitis offensis aut intempestivis blanditiis mutabilem , contemnebant metuebantque$$ Vitellius himself ,  who was ever varying between sudden irritation and unseasonable fondness ,  they at once despised and feared
 nec eo segnius invaserant domos hortos opesque imperii , cum flebilis et egens nobilium turba , quos ipsos liberosque patriae Galba reddiderat , nulla principis misericordia iuvarentur$$ Still this had not made them less keen to seize on palaces and gardens and all the wealth of the Empire ,  while a sad and needy throng of nobles ,  whom with their children Galba had restored to their country ,  received no relief from the compassion of the Emperor
 gratum primoribus civitatis etiam plebs adprobavit , quod reversis ab exilio iura libertorum concessisset , quamquam id omni modo servilia ingenia corrumpebant , abditis pecuniis per occultos aut ambitiosos sinus , et quidam in domum Caesaris transgressi atque ipsis dominis potentiores$$ By an edict which gratified the leading men of the State ,  while it approved itself even to the populace ,  Vitellius gave back to the returned exiles their rights over their freedmen ,  although servile ingenuity sought in every way to neutralise the boon ,  concealing money in quarters which either obscurity or rank rendered secure Some freedmen had made their way into the palace of the Emperor ,  and thus became more powerful even than their patrons
 Sed miles , plenis castris et redundante multitudine , in porticibus aut delubris et urbe tota vagus , non principia noscere , non servare vigilias neque labore firmari$$ Meanwhile the soldiers ,  as their numbers overflowed the crowded camp ,  dispersed throughout the porticoes ,  the temples ,  and the whole capital ,  did not know their own headquarters ,  kept no watch ,  and ceased to brace themselves by toil
 per inlecebras urbis et inhonesta dictu corpus otio , animum libidinibus imminuebant$$ Amidst the allurements of the city and all shameful excesses ,  they wasted their strength in idleness ,  and their energies in riot
 postremo ne salutis quidem cura infamibus Vaticani locis magna pars tetendit , unde crebrae in vulgus mortes$$ At last ,  reckless even of health ,  a large portion of them quartered themselves in the notoriously pestilential neighbourhood of the Vatican
 et adiacente Tiberi Germanorum Gallorumque obnoxia morbis corpora fluminis aviditas et aestus impatientia labefecit$$ hence ensued a great mortality in the ranks The Tiber was close at hand ,  and their extreme eagerness for the water and their impatience of the heat weakened the constitutions of the Germans and Gauls ,  always liable to disease
 insuper confusus pravitate vel ambitu ordo militiae$$ To make matters worse ,  the organisation of the service was deranged by unprincipled intrigue and favour
 sedecim praetoriae , quattuor urbanae cohortes scribebantur , quis singula milia inessent$$ Sixteen Praetorian and four city cohorts were being raised ,  each to consist of a thousand men
 plus in eo dilectu Valens audebat , tamquam ipsum Caecinam periculo exemisset$$ In this levy Valens ventured to do more than his rival on the pretence of his having rescued Caecina himself from peril
 sane adventu eius partes convaluerant , et sinistrum lenti itineris rumorem prospero proelio verterat$$ Doubtless his arrival had restored the fortunes of the party ,  and his victory had reversed the unfavourable rumours occasioned by his tardy advance
 omnisque inferioris Germaniae miles Valentem adsectabatur , unde primum creditur Caecinae fides fluitasse$$ The entire army too of Lower Germany was attached to him this circumstance ,  it is thought ,  first made the allegiance of Caecina waver
 Prima Vitellio tertiae legionis defectio nuntiatur , missis ab Aponio Saturnino epistulis , antequam is quoque Vespasiani partibus adgregaretur$$ The first revolt of which Vitellius received tidings was that of the 3rd legion ,  despatches having been sent by Aponius Saturninus before he too attached himself to the party of Vespasian
 sed neque Aponius cuncta , ut trepidans re subita , perscripserat , et amici adulantes mollius interpretabantur$$ Aponius ,  however ,  agitated by the unexpected occurrence ,  had not written all the particulars ,  and flattering friends softened down its import
 unius legionis eam seditionem , ceteris exercitibus constare fidem$$ It was ,  they said ,  a mutiny of only a single legion
 in hunc modum etiam Vitellius apud milites disseruit , praetorianos nuper exauctoratos insectatus , a quibus falsos rumores dispergi , nec ullum civilis belli metum adseverabat , suppresso Vespasiani nomine et vagis per urbem militibus qui sermones populi coercerent$$ the loyalty of the other armies was unshaken Vitellius in addressing the soldiers spoke to the same effect He inveighed against the lately disbanded Praetorians ,  and asserted that false rumours were circulated by them ,  and that there was no fear of a civil war The name of Vespasian he suppressed ,  and soldiers were dispersed through the city to check the popular gossip
 id praecipuum alimentum famae erat$$ This more than anything else kept these rumours alive
 Auxilia tamen e Germania Britanniaque et Hispaniis excivit , segniter et necessitatem dissimulans$$ Nevertheless Vitellius summoned auxiliary troops from Germany ,  Britain ,  and Spain ,  tardily ,  however ,  and with an attempt to conceal his necessities
 perinde legati provinciaeque cunctabantur , Hordeonius Flaccus suspectis iam Batavis anxius proprio bello , Vettius Bolanus numquam satis quieta Britannia , et uterque ambigui$$ The legates and the provinces were equally slow Hordeonius Flaccus ,  who was beginning to suspect the Batavians ,  feared that he should have a war on his own hands ,  and Vettius Bolanus had in Britain a province never very quiet
 neque ex Hispaniis properabatur , nullo tum ibi consulari$$ and both these officers were wavering in their allegiance
 trium legionum legati , pares iure et prosperis Vitellii rebus certaturi ad obsequium , adversam eius fortunam ex aequo detrectabant in Africa legio cohortesque delectae a Clodio Macro , mox a Galba dimissae , rursus iussu Vitellii militiam cepere simul cetera iuventus dabat impigre nomina quippe integrum illic ac favorabilem proconsulatum Vitellius , famosum invisumque Vespasianus egerat$$ Spain too ,  which then was without a governor of consular rank ,  showed no alacrity The legates of the three legions ,  equal in authority ,  and ready ,  while Vitellius was prosperous ,  to vie in obedience ,  stood aloof with one consent from his falling fortunes In Africa ,  the legion ,  and the auxiliary infantry levied by Clodius Macer and soon after disbanded by Galba ,  again entered the service at the order of Vitellius ,  while all the rest of the youth promptly gave in their names Vitellius had ruled that province as proconsul with integrity and popularity
 proinde socii de imperio utriusque coniectabant , sed experimentum contra fuit$$ Vespasian's government had been infamous and odious The allies formed conjectures accordingly as to the manner in which each would reign ,  but the result contradicted them
 Ac primo Valerius Festus legatus studia provincialium cum fide iuvit$$ At first Valerius Festus ,  the legate ,  loyally seconded the zeal of the provincials
 mox nutabat , palam epistulis edictisque Vitellium , occultis nuntiis Vespasianum fovens et haec illave defensurus , prout invaluissent$$ Soon he began to waver ,  supporting Vitellius in his public dispatches and edicts ,  Vespasian in his secret correspondence ,  and intending to hold by the one or the other according as they might succeed
 deprehensi cum litteris edictisque Vespasiani per Raetiam et Gallias militum et centurionum quidam ad Vitellium missi necantur$$ Some soldiers and centurions ,  coming through Rhaetia and Gaul ,  were seized with letters and edicts from Vespasian ,  and on being sent to Vitellius were put to death
 plures fefellere , fide amicorum aut suomet astu occultati$$ More ,  however ,  eluded discovery ,  escaping either through the faithful protection of friends or by their own tact
 ita Vitellii paratus noscebantur , Vespasiani consiliorum pleraque ignota , primum socordia Vitellii , dein Pannonicae Alpes praesidiis insessae nuntios retinebant$$ Thus the preparations of Vitellius became known ,  while the plans of Vespasian were for the most part kept secret At first the supineness of Vitellius was in fault afterwards the occupation of the Pannonian Alps with troops stopped all intelligence
 mare quoque etesiarum flatu in Orientem navigantibus secundum , inde adversum erat$$ And on the sea the prevalent Etesian winds favoured an eastward voyage ,  but hindered all return
 Tandem inruptione hostium atrocibus undique nuntiis exterritus Caecinam ac Valentem expedire ad bellum iubet$$ At length Vitellius ,  appalled by the irruption of the enemy and by the menacing intelligence from every quarter ,  ordered Caecina and Valens to take the field
 praemissus Caecina , Valentem e gravi corporis morbo tum primum adsurgentem infirmitas tardabat$$ Caecina was sent on in advance Valens ,  who was just recovering from a severe illness ,  was delayed by weakness
 longe alia proficiscentis ex urbe Germanici exercitus species$$ Far different was the appearance of the German army as it marched out of the capital
 non vigor corporibus , non ardor animis$$ All strength had departed from their bodies ,  all energy from their spirits
 lentum et rarum agmen , fluxa arma , segnes equi$$ Slowly ,  and with thin ranks ,  the column moved along ,  their weapons feebly grasped ,  their horses spiritless
 impatiens solis pulveris tempestatum , quantumque hebes ad sustinendum laborem miles , tanto ad discordias promptior$$ The soldiers ,  impatient of the heat ,  the dust ,  and the weather ,  in proportion as they were less capable of enduring toil ,  were more ready for mutiny
 accedebat huc Caecinae ambitio vetus , torpor recens , nimia fortunae indulgentia soluti in luxum , seu perfidiam meditanti infringere exercitus virtutem inter artis erat$$ All this was aggravated by the old vanity of Caecina ,  and by the indolence that had of late crept over him presuming on the excessive favour of fortune ,  he had abandoned himself to luxury Perhaps he meditated perfidy ,  and it was part of his policy to enervate the courage of the army
 credidere plerique Flavii Sabini consiliis concussam Caecinae mentem , ministro sermonum Rubrio Gallo$$ Many believe that his fidelity had been shaken by the suggestions of Flavius Sabinus ,  who employed Rubrius Gallus as the bearer of communications intimating that the conditions of desertion would be held binding by Vespasian
 rata apud Vespasianum fore pacta transitionis$$ At the same time he was reminded of his hatred and jealousy of Fabius Valens
 simul odiorum invidiaeque erga Fabium Valentem admonebatur ut impar apud Vitellium gratiam virisque apud novum principem pararet$$ Being inferior to his rival in influence with Vitellius ,  he should seek to secure favour and power with the new Emperor
 Caecina e complexu Vitellii multo cum honore digressus partem equitum ad occupandam Cremonam praemisit$$ Caecina ,  having embraced Vitellius and received tokens of high distinction ,  left him ,  and sent a detachment of cavalry to occupy Cremona
 mox vexilla primae , quartae , quintaedecimae , sextaedecimae legionum , dein quinta et duoetvicensima secutae postremo agmine unaetvicensima Rapax et prima Italica incessere cum vexillariis trium Britannicarum legionum et electis auxiliis$$ It was followed by the veteran troops of the 4th ,  10th ,  and 16th legions ,  by the 5th and 22nd legions ,  and the rear was brought up by the 21st (the Rapax) and the first Italian legion with the veteran troops of three British legions ,  and a chosen body of auxiliaries After the departure of Caecina ,  Valens sent a despatch to the army which had been under his own command with directions that it should wait for him on the road
 profecto Caecina scripsit Fabius Valens exercitui , quem ipse ductaverat , ut in itinere opperiretur sic sibi cum Caecina convenisse$$ such ,  he said ,  was his arrangement with Caecina Caecina ,  however ,  being with the army in person ,  and consequently having greater influence ,  pretended that this plan had been changed ,  so that the gathering forces of the enemy might be met with their whole strength
 qui praesens eoque validior mutatum id consilium finxit ut ingruenti bello tota mole occurreretur$$ Orders were therefore given to the legions to advance with all speed upon Cremona ,  while a portion of the force was to proceed to Hostilia
 ita adcelerare legiones Cremonam , pars Hostiliam petere iussae$$ Caecina himself turned aside to Ravenna ,  on the pretext that he wished to address the fleet
 ipse Ravennam devertit praetexto classem adloquendi$$ Soon ,  however ,  he sought the retirement of Patavium ,  there to concert his treachery
 mox Patavii secretum componendae proditionis quaesitum namque Lucilius Bassus post praefecturam alae Ravennati simul ac Misenensi classibus a Vitellio praepositus , quod non statim praefecturam praetorii adeptus foret , iniquam iracundiam flagitiosa perfidia ulciscebatur$$ Lucilius Bassus ,  who had been promoted by Vitellius from the command of a squadron of cavalry to be admiral of the fleets at Ravenna and Misenum ,  failing immediately to obtain the command of the Praetorian Guard sought to gratify his unreasonable resentment by an atrocious act of perfidy It cannot be certainly known whether he carried Caecina with him ,  or whether (as is often the case with bad men ,  that they are like each other) both were actuated by the same evil motives
 Meliore fato fideque partium Flavianarum duces consilia belli tractabant$$ UNDER happier auspices and in a more loyal spirit the Flavianist leaders were discussing the plans of the campaign
 Poetovionem in hiberna tertiae decimae legionis convenerant$$ They had assembled at Petovio ,  the winter-quarters of the 13th legion
 illic agitavere placeretne obstrui Pannoniae Alpes , donec a tergo vires universae consurgerent , an ire comminus et certare pro Italia constantius foret$$ There they debated ,  whether they should blockade the passes of the Pannonian Alps till the whole strength of their party should be gathered in their rear ,  or whether it would be the more vigorous policy to close with the enemy ,  and to contend for the possession of Italy
 quibus opperiri auxilia et trahere bellum videbatur , Germanicarum legionum vim famamque extollebant , et advenisse mox cum Vitellio Britannici exercitus robora$$ Those who thought it advisable to wait for reinforcements ,  and to protract the campaign ,  dwelt on the strength and reputation of the German legions Vitellius ,  they said ,  has now joined them with the flower of the British army
 ipsis nec numerum parem pulsarum nuper legionum , et quamquam atrociter loquerentur , minorem esse apud victos animum$$ Our numbers are not even equal to those of the legions whom they lately defeated and the conquered ,  let them talk as fiercely as they will ,  lose something of their courage
 sed insessis interim Alpibus venturum cum copiis Orientis Mucianum$$ But ,  if we occupy meanwhile the passes of the Alps ,  Mucianus will come up with the forces of the East
 superesse Vespasiano mare , classis , studia provinciarum , per quas velut alterius belli molem cieret$$ Vespasian has in addition the command of the sea ,  his fleets ,  and provinces loyal to his cause ,  in which he may collect the vast materials for what may be called another war
 ita salubri mora novas viris adfore , ex praesentibus nihil periturum$$ A salutary delay will bring us new forces ,  while we shall lose nothing of what we have
 Ad ea Antonius Primus (is acerrimus belli concitator) festinationem ipsis utilem , Vitellio exitiosam disseruit$$ In answer to this ,  Antonius Primus ,  who was the most energetic promoter of the war ,  declared that prompt action would be advantageous to themselves ,  and fatal to Vitellius
 plus socordiae quam fiduciae accessisse victoribus$$ Supineness ,  he said ,  rather than confidence has grown upon the conquerors
 neque enim in procinctu et castris habitos$$ They are not even kept under arms or within camps
 per omnia Italiae municipia desides , tantum hospitibus metuendos , quanto ferocius ante se egerint , tanto cupidius insolitas voluptates hausisse$$ In every town of Italy ,  sunk in sloth ,  formidable only to their entertainers ,  they have drunk of unaccustomed pleasures with an eagerness equal to the rudeness of their former life
 circo quoque ac theatris et amoenitate urbis emollitos aut valetudinibus fessos$$ They have been emasculated by the circus ,  the theatre ,  and the allurements of the capital ,  or they are worn out with sickness
 sed addito spatio rediturum et his robur meditatione belli$$ Yet even to these men ,  if you give them time ,  their old vigour will return with the preparation for war
 nec procul Germaniam , unde vires$$ Germany ,  whence their strength is drawn ,  is faraway
 Britanniam freto dirimi , iuxta Gallias Hispaniasque , utrimque viros equos tributa , ipsamque Italiam et opes urbis$$ Britain is separated only by a strait the provinces of Gaul and Spain are near
 ac si inferre arma ultro velint , duas classis vacuumque Illyricum mare$$ on either side they can find troops ,  horses ,  tribute
 quid tum claustra montium profutura quid tractum in aestatem aliam bellum$$ they have Italy itself ,  and the resources of the capital ,  and ,  should they choose themselves to take the offensive ,  they have two fleets ,  and the Illyrian sea open to them
 unde interim pecuniam et commeatus$$ What good then will our mountain-passes do us
 quin potius eo ipso uterentur quod Pannonicae legiones deceptae magis quam victae resurgere in ultionem properent , Moesici exercitus integras viris attulerint$$ What will be the use of having protracted the war into another summer Where are we to find in the meanwhile money and supplies
 si numerus militum potius quam legionum putetur , plus hinc roboris , nihil libidinum$$ Why not rather avail ourselves of the fact that the legions of Pannonia ,  which were cheated rather than vanquished ,  are hastening to rise again for vengeance ,  and that the armies of Moesia have brought us their unimpaired strength
 et profuisse disciplinae ipsum pudorem$$ If you reckon the number of soldiers ,  rather than that of legions ,  we have greater strength ,  and no vices ,  for our very humiliation has been most helpful to our discipline
 equites vero ne tum quidem victos , sed quamquam rebus adversis disiectam Vitellii aciem$$ As for the cavalry ,  they were not vanquished even on that day
 duae tunc Pannonicae ac Moesicae alae perrupere hostem$$ though the fortune of war was against them ,  they penetrated the Vitellianist lines
 nunc sedecim alarum coniuncta signa pulsu sonituque et nube ipsa operient ac superfundent oblitos proeliorum equites equosque$$ Two squadrons of Moesian and Pannonian cavalry then broke through the enemy
 nisi quis retinet , idem suasor auctorque consilii ero$$ now the united standards of sixteen squadrons will bury and overwhelm with the crash and din and storm of their onset these horses and horsemen that have forgotten how to fight
 vos , quibus fortuna in integro est , legiones continete$$ Unless any one hinders me ,  I who suggest will execute the plan
 mihi expeditae cohortes sufficient$$ You ,  whose fortune never suffered a reverse ,  may keep back the legions
 iam reseratam Italiam , impulsas Vitellii res audietis$$ the light cohorts will be enough for me
 iuvabit sequi et vestigiis vincentis insistere$$ Before long you will hear that Italy has been opened ,  and the power of Vitellius shaken
 Proxima Cornelii Fusci procuratoris auctoritas$$ Next to Primus in influence was Cornelius Fuscus ,  the procurator
 is quoque inclementer in Vitellium invehi solitus nihil spei sibi inter adversa reliquerat$$ He also had been accustomed to inveigh mercilessly against Vitellius ,  and had thus left himself no hope in the event of defeat
 Tampius Flavianus , natura ac senecta cunctator , suspiciones militum inritabat , tamquam adfinitatis cum Vitellio meminisset$$ T Ampius Flavianus ,  disposed to caution by natural temperament and advanced years ,  excited in the soldiers a suspicion that he still remembered his relationship to Vitellius
 idemque , quod coeptante legionum motu profugus , dein sponte remeaverat , perfidiae locum quaesisse credebatur$$ and as he had fled when the movement in the legions began ,  and had then voluntarily returned ,  it was believed that he had sought an opportunity for treachery
 nam Flavianum , omissa Pannonia ingressum Italiam et discrimini exemptum , rerum novarum cupido legati nomen resumere et misceri civilibus armis impulerat , suadente Cornelio Fusco , non quia industria Flaviani egebat , sed ut consulare nomen surgentibus cum maxime partibus honesta specie praetenderetur$$ Flavianus indeed had left Pannonia ,  and had entered Italy ,  and was out of the way of danger ,  when his desire for revolution urged him to resume the title of Legate ,  and to take part in the civil strife Cornelius Fuscus had advised him to this course ,  not that he needed the talents of Flavianus ,  but wishing that a consular name might clothe with its high prestige the very first movements of the party
 Ceterum ut transmittere in Italiam impune et usui foret , scriptum Aponio Saturnino , cum exercitu Moesico celeraret$$ Still ,  that the passage into Italy might be safe and advantageous ,  directions were sent to Aponius Saturninus to hasten up with the armies of Moesia That the provinces might not be exposed without defence to the barbarian tribes ,  the princes of the Sarmatae Iazyges ,  who had in their hands the government of that nation ,  were enrolled in the army
 ac ne inermes provinciae barbaris nationibus exponerentur , principes Sarmatarum Iazugum , penes quos civitatis regimen , in commilitium adsciti$$ These chiefs also offered the service of their people ,  and its force of cavalry ,  their only effective troops but the offer was declined ,  lest in the midst of civil strife they should attempt some hostile enterprise ,  or ,  influenced by higher offers from other quarters ,  should cast off all sense of right and duty
 plebem quoque et vim equitum , qua sola valent , offerebant$$ Sido and Italicus ,  kings of the Suevi ,  were brought over to the cause Their loyalty to the Roman people was of long standing ,  and their nation was more faithful than the other to any trust reposed in them
 remissum id munus , ne inter discordias externa molirentur aut maiore ex diverso mercede ius fasque exuerent trahuntur in partis Sido atque Italicus reges Sueborum , quis vetus obsequium erga Romanos et gens fidei$$ On the flank of the army were posted some auxiliaries ,  for Rhaetia was hostile ,  Portius Septimius ,  the procurator ,  remaining incorruptibly faithful to Vitellius Accordingly ,  Sextilius Felix with Aurius' Horse ,  eight cohorts ,  and the native levies of Noricum ,  was sent to occupy the bank of the river Aenus ,  which flows between Rhaetia and Noricum Neither hazarded an engagement ,  and the fate of the two parties was decided elsewhere
 Antonio vexillarios e cohortibus et partem equitum ad invadendam Italiam rapienti comes fuit Arrius Varus , strenuus bello , quam gloriam et dux Corbulo et prosperae in Armenia res addiderant$$ Antonius ,  as he hurried with the veteran soldiers of the cohorts and part of the cavalry to invade Italy ,  was accompanied by Arrius Varus ,  an energetic soldier Service under Corbulo ,  and successes in Armenia ,  had gained for him this reputation
 idem secretis apud Neronem sermonibus ferebatur Corbulonis virtutes criminatus$$ yet it was generally said ,  that in secret conversations with Nero he had calumniated Corbulo's high qualities
 unde infami gratia primum pilum adepto laeta ad praesens male parta mox in perniciem vertere$$ The favour thus infamously acquired made him a centurion of the first rank ,  yet the ill-gotten prosperity of the moment afterwards turned to his destruction
 sed Primus ac Varus occupata Aquileia <per> proxima quaeque et Opitergii et Altini laetis animis accipiuntur$$ Primus and Varus ,  having occupied Aquileia ,  were joyfully welcomed in the neighbourhood ,  and in the towns of Opitergium and Altinum
 relictum Altini praesidium adversus classis Ravennatis <conatus> , nondum defectione eius audita$$ At Altinum a force was left to oppose the Ravenna fleet ,  the defection of which from Vitellius was not yet known
 inde Patavium et Ateste partibus adiunxere$$ They next attached to their party Patavium and Ateste
 illic cognitum tris Vitellianas cohortis et alam , cui Sebosianae nomen , ad Forum Alieni ponte iuncto consedisse$$ There they learnt that three cohorts ,  belonging to Vitellius ,  and the Sebonian Horse had taken up a position at the Forum Alieni ,  where they had thrown a bridge across the river
 placuit occasio invadendi incuriosos$$ It was determined to seize the opportunity of attacking this force ,  unprepared as it was
 nam id quoque nuntiabatur$$ for this fact had likewise been communicated
 luce prima inermos plerosque oppressere$$ Coming upon them at dawn ,  they killed many before they could arm
 praedictum ut paucis interfectis ceteros pavore ad mutandam fidem cogerent$$ Orders had been given to slay but few ,  and to constrain the rest by fear to transfer their allegiance
 et fuere qui se statim dederent plures abrupto ponte instanti hosti viam abstulerunt$$ Some indeed at once surrendered ,  but the greater part broke down the bridge ,  and thus cut off the advance of the pursuing enemy
 Vulgata victoria legiones septima Galbiana , tertia decima Gemina cum Vedio Aquila legato Patavium alacres veniunt ibi pauci dies ad requiem sumpti , et Minicius Iustus praefectus castrorum legionis septimae , quia adductius quam civili bello imperitabat , subtractus militum irae ad Vespasianum missus est$$ When this success became known ,  two legions ,  the seventh (Galba's) and the eighteenth (the Gemina) ,  finding the campaign opening in favour of the Flavianists ,  repaired with alacrity to Patavium under the command of Vedius Aquila the legate A few days were there taken for rest ,  and Minucius Justus ,  prefect of the camp in the 7th legion ,  who ruled with more strictness than a civil war will permit ,  was withdrawn from the exasperated soldiery ,  and sent to Vespasian
 desiderata diu res interpretatione gloriaque in maius accipitur , postquam Galbae imagines discordia temporum subversas in omnibus municipiis recoli iussit Antonius , decorum pro causa ratus , si placere Galbae principatus et partes revirescere crederentur$$ An act that had been long desired was taken by a flattering construction for more than it was worth ,  when Antonius gave orders that the statues of Galba ,  which had been thrown down during the troubles of the times ,  should be restored in all the towns It would ,  he supposed ,  reflect honour on the cause ,  if it were thought that they had been friendly to Galba's rule ,  and that his party was again rising into strength
 Quaesitum inde quae sedes bello legeretur$$ The next question was ,  what place should be selected as the seat of war
 Verona potior visa , patentibus circum campis ad pugnam equestrem , qua praevalebant$$ Verona seemed the most eligible ,  surrounded as it was with open plains ,  suitable for the action of cavalry ,  in which they were very strong
 simul coloniam copiis validam auferre Vitellio in rem famamque videbatur$$ At the same time it was thought that in wresting from Vitellius a colony so rich in resources there would be both profit and glory
 possessa ipso transitu Vicetia$$ They secured Vicetia by simply passing through it
 quod per se parvum (etenim modicae municipio vires) magni momenti locum obtinuit reputantibus illic Caecinam genitum et patriam hostium duci ereptam$$ Though in itself a small gain ,  for the town is but of moderate strength ,  it was considered an important advantage when they reflected that in this town Caecina was born ,  and that the general of the enemy had lost his native place
 in Veronensibus pretium fuit$$ The people of Verona were a valuable aid
 exemplo opibusque partis iuvere et interiectus exercitus Raetiam Iuliasque Alpis , ac ne pervium illa Germanicis exercitibus foret , obsaepserat$$ they served the cause by the example of their zeal and by their wealth ,  and the army thus occupied a position between Rhaetia and the Julian Alps
 quae ignara Vespasiano aut vetita$$ It was to cut off all passage at this point from the armies of Germany that they had barred this route
 quippe Aquileiae sisti bellum expectarique Mucianum iubebat , adiciebatque imperio consilium , quando Aegyptus , claustra annonae , vectigalia opulentissimarum provinciarum obtinerentur , posse Vitellii exercitum egestate stipendii frumentique ad deditionem subigi$$ All this was done either without the knowledge ,  or against the commands of Vespasian He gave orders that the army should halt at Aquileia and there await Mucianus and these orders he supported by the argument ,  that as Aegypt ,  which commanded the corn supplies ,  and the revenues of the wealthiest provinces were in his hands ,  the army of Vitellius would be compelled to capitulate from the want of pay and provisions
 eadem Mucianus crebris epistulis monebat , incruentam et sine luctu victoriam et alia huiusce modi praetexendo , sed gloriae avidus atque omne belli decus sibi retinens$$ Mucianus in frequent letters advised the same policy a victory that should cost neither blood nor tears ,  and other objects of the kind ,  were his pretexts but in truth he was greedy of glory ,  and anxious to keep the whole credit of the war to himself
 ceterum ex distantibus terrarum spatiis consilia post res adferebantur$$ Owing ,  however ,  to the vast distances ,  the advice came only after the matter was decided
 Adventu deinde duarum legionum , e quibus tertiam Dillius Aponianus , octavam Numisius Lupus ducebant , ostentare viris et militari vallo Veronam circumdare placuit$$ On the subsequent arrival of two legions ,  the third commanded by Dillius Aponianus ,  the eighth by Numisius Lupus ,  it was resolved to make a demonstration of their strength ,  and to surround Verona with military lines
 forte Galbianae legioni in adversa fronte valli opus cesserat , et visi procul sociorum equites vanam formidinem ut hostes fecere$$ It so happened that Galba's legion had had their work allotted to them on that side the lines which faced the enemy ,  and that some of the allied cavalry appearing in the distance were taken for the enemy ,  and excited a groundless panic
 rapiuntur arma metu proditionis$$ They flew to arms ,  and as the rage of the soldiers at the supposed treachery fell upon T
 ira militum in Tampium Flavianum incubuit , nullo criminis argumento , sed iam pridem invisus turbine quodam ad exitium poscebatur$$ Ampius Flavianus ,  not from any proof of his guilt ,  but because he had been long unpopular ,  they clamoured for his death in a very whirlwind of passion ,  vociferating that he was the kinsman of Vitellius ,  that he had betrayed Otho ,  that he had embezzled the donative
 propinquum Vitellii , proditorem Othonis , interceptorem donativi clamitabant$$ He could get no opportunity of defending himself ,  even though he stretched out his hands in entreaty ,  repeatedly prostrating himself on the ground ,  his garments torn ,  his breast and features convulsed with sobs
 nec defensioni locus , quamquam supplicis manus tenderet , humi plerumque stratus , lacera veste , pectus atque ora singultu quatiens$$ This very conduct provoked afresh these furious men ,  for fear so excessive seemed to argue a consciousness of guilt
 id ipsum apud infensos incitamentum erat , tamquam nimius pavor conscientiam argueret$$ Aponius was clamoured down by the shouts of the soldiers ,  when he attempted to address them
 obturbabatur militum vocibus Aponius , cum loqui coeptaret$$ every one else was repulsed with noisy cries
 fremitu et clamore ceteros aspernantur$$ To Antonius alone the soldiers' ears were open
 uni Antonio apertae militum aures$$ for he had eloquence ,  the art of soothing an angry crowd ,  and personal influence
 namque et facundia aderat mulcendique vulgum artes et auctoritas$$ As the mutiny grew fiercer ,  and the soldiers went on from abuse and taunts to use their hands and their weapons ,  he ordered that Flavianus should be put in irons
 ubi crudescere seditio et a conviciis ac probris ad tela et manus transibant , inici catenas Flaviano iubet$$ The soldiers saw what a mockery it was ,  and pushing aside those who were guarding the tribunal ,  were about to commit the most outrageous violence
 sensit ludibrium miles , disiectisque qui tribunal tuebantur extrema vis parabatur$$ Antonius threw himself in the way with his sword drawn ,  protesting that he would die either by the soldiers' hands or by his own
 opposuit sinum Antonius stricto ferro , aut militum se manibus aut suis moriturum obtestans , ut quemque notum et aliquo militari decore insignem aspexerat , ad ferendam opem nomine ciens$$ whenever he saw any one who was known to him ,  or who was distinguished by any military decoration ,  he summoned him by name to his assistance Then he turned to the standards ,  and prayed to the gods of war ,  that they would inspire the armies of the enemy ,  rather than his own ,  with such madness and such strife
 mox conversus ad signa et bellorum deos , hostium potius exercitibus illum furorem , illam discordiam inicerent orabat , donec fatisceret seditio et extremo iam die sua quisque in tentoria dilaberentur$$ So the mutiny began to abate ,  and at the close of the day the men dispersed to their tents The same night Flavianus set out ,  and being met by letters from Vespasian ,  was relieved from his perilous position
 Ne in Vitellii quidem partibus quietae mentes exitiosiore discordia non suspicionibus vulgi , sed perfidia ducum turbabantur$$ Nor indeed was there less restlessness among the partisans of Vitellius ,  who were distracted by yet more fatal dissensions ,  springing ,  not from the suspicions of the common men ,  but from the treachery of the generals
 Lucilius Bassus classis Ravennatis praefectus ambiguos militum animos , quod magna pars Dalmatae Pannoniique erant , quae provinciae Vespasiano tenebantur , partibus eius adgregaverat$$ Lucilius Bassus ,  prefect of the Ravenna fleet ,  finding that the troops wavered in purpose ,  from the fact that many were natives of Dalmatia and Pannonia ,  provinces held for Vespasian ,  had attached them to the Flavianist party
 nox proditioni electa , ut ceteris ignaris soli in principia defectores coirent$$ The night-time was chosen for accomplishing the treason ,  because then ,  unknown to all the rest ,  the ringleaders alone might assemble at head-quarters
 Bassus pudore seu metu , quisnam exitus foret , intra domum opperiebatur$$ Bassus ,  moved by shame ,  or perhaps by fear ,  awaited the issue in his house
 trierarchi magno tumultu Vitellii imagines invadunt$$ The captains of the triremes rushed with a great outcry on the images of Vitellius
 et paucis resistentium obtruncatis ceterum vulgus rerum novarum studio in Vespasianum inclinabat$$ a few ,  who attempted to resist ,  were cut down the great majority ,  with the usual love of change ,  were ready to join Vespasian
 tum progressus Lucilius auctorem se palam praebet$$ Then Bassus came forward and openly sanctioned the movement
 classis Cornelium Fuscum praefectum sibi destinat , qui propere adcucurrit$$ The fleet appointed Cornelius Fuscus to be prefect ,  and he hastened to join them
 Bassus honorata custodia Liburnicis navibus Atriam pervectus a praefecto alae Vibennio Rufino , praesidium illic agitante , vincitur , sed exoluta statim vincula interventu Hormi Caesaris liberti is quoque inter duces habebatur$$ Lucilius was put under honourable arrest ,  and conveyed as far as Adria by the Liburnian ships there he was thrown into prison by Vivennius Rufinus ,  prefect of a squadron of cavalry ,  which was there in garrison His chains ,  however ,  were immediately struck off on the interference of Hormus ,  one of the Emperor's freedmen ,  for he too ranked among the generals
 At Caecina , defectione classis vulgata , primores centurionum et paucos militum , ceteris per militiae munera dispersis , secretum castrorum adfectans in principia vocat$$ On the revolt of the fleet becoming known ,  Caecina called together to head-quarters ,  which he purposely selected as being the most retired part of the camp ,  the chief centurions and some few soldiers ,  while the rest were dispersed on various military duties
 ibi Vespasiani virtutem virisque partium extollit$$ Then he extolled the valour of Vespasian ,  and the strength of his party
 transfugisse classem , in arto commeatum , adversas Gallias Hispaniasque , nihil in urbe fidum$$ he told them that the fleet had changed sides ,  that they were straitened for supplies ,  that Gaul and Spain were against them ,  that in the capital there was nothing on which to rely ,  thus making the worst of everything that concerned Vitellius
 atque omnia de Vitellio in deterius mox incipientibus qui conscii aderant , ceteros re nova attonitos in verba Vespasiani adigit$$ Then ,  the conspirators present setting the example ,  and the rest being paralysed by the strangeness of the proceeding ,  he made them swear allegiance to Vespasian
 simul Vitellii imagines dereptae et missi qui Antonio nuntiarent$$ At the same time the images of Vitellius were torn down ,  and persons were despatched to convey the intelligence to Antonius
 sed ubi totis castris in fama proditio , recurrens in principia miles praescriptum Vespasiani nomen , proiectas Vitellii effigies aspexit , vastum primo silentium , mox cuncta simul erumpunt$$ But when this treason became noised abroad throughout the camp ,  when the soldiers ,  hurrying back to head-quarters ,  saw the name of Vespasian written on the colours ,  and the images of Vitellius thrown upon the ground ,  first there was a gloomy silence ,  then all their rage burst out at once
 huc cecidisse Germanici exercitus gloriam ut sine proelio , sine vulnere vinctas manus et capta traderent arma$$ What ,  they cried ,  has the glory of the army of Germany fallen so low ,  that without a battle ,  even without a wound ,  they should yield up hands ready bound and arms resigned to surrender
 quas enim ex diverso legiones$$ What legions indeed are these against us
 nempe victas$$ Only the conquered
 et abesse unicum Othoniani exercitus robur , primanos quartadecimanosque , quos tamen isdem illis campis fuderint straverintque$$ The first and the twelfth ,  the sole strength of the Othonianist army ,  are not there ,  and even them we routed and crushed on these very plains ,  only that so many thousands of armed men ,  like a herd of slaves for sale ,  might be given as a present to the exile Antonius
 ut tot armatorum milia , velut grex venalium , exuli Antonio donum darentur$$ Thus ,  forsooth ,  the adhesion of one fleet would be worth eight legions
 octo nimirum legiones unius classis accessionem fore$$ So it pleases Bassus and Caecina ,  after robbing the Emperor of palaces ,  gardens ,  and money ,  to rob the soldiers of their Emperor
 id Basso , id Caecinae visum , postquam domos hortos opes principi abstulerint , etiam militem auferre$$ But we ,  who have seen nothing of toil and bloodshed ,  we ,  who must be contemptible even to the Flavianists ,  what shall we answer to those who shall ask us of our victories and our defeats
 Quinta ferme hora diei erat , cum citus eques adventare hostis , praegredi paucos , motum fremitumque late audiri nuntiavit$$ It was almost eleven o'clock ,  when a horseman arrived at full speed with the news ,  that the enemy were approaching ,  that a small body was moving in front ,  but that the stir and noise could be heard far and wide
 dum Antonius quidnam agendum consultat , aviditate navandae operae Arrius Varus cum promptissimis equitum prorupit impulitque Vitellianos modica caede$$ While Antonius was deliberating as to what was to be done ,  Arrius Varus ,  eager to do his best ,  charged with the bravest of the cavalry ,  and drove back the Vitellianists ,  inflicting upon them some slight loss
 nam plurium adcursu versa fortuna , et acerrimus quisque sequentium fugae ultimus erat$$ as more came up ,  the fortune of the day changed ,  and those who had been most eager in the pursuit found themselves last in the flight
 nec sponte Antonii properatum , et fore quae acciderant rebatur$$ This rash act did not originate with Antonius
 hortatus suos ut magno animo capesserent pugnam , diductis in latera turmis vacuum medio relinquit iter quo Varum equitesque eius reciperet$$ he anticipated in fact what actually happened He now urged his soldiers to enter on the battle with a good heart he then drew off the squadrons of his cavalry to the two flanks ,  leaving in the midst an open space in which to receive Varus and his troopers
 iussae armari legiones datum per agros signum ut , qua cuique proximum , omissa praeda proelio occurreret$$ the legions were ordered to arm themselves ,  signals were made over the country that every man should leave plundering ,  and join the battle at the nearest point
 pavidus interim Varus turbae suorum miscetur intulitque formidinem$$ Meanwhile the terror-stricken Varus plunged into the disordered ranks of his friends ,  and brought a panic with him
 pulsi cum sauciis integri suomet ipsi metu et angustiis viarum conflictabantur$$ The fresh troops were driven back along with the wounded fugitives ,  confused by their own alarm and by the difficulties of the road
 Nullum in illa trepidatione Antonius constantis ducis aut fortis militis officium omisit$$ In the midst of this panic Antonius omitted nothing that a self-possessed commander or a most intrepid soldier could do
 occursare paventibus , retinere cedentis , ubi plurimus labor , unde aliqua spes , consilio manu voce insignis hosti , conspicuus suis eo postremo ardoris provectus est ut vexillarium fugientem hasta transverberaret$$ He threw himself before the terrified fugitives ,  he held back those who were giving way ,  and wherever the struggle was hardest ,  wherever there was a gleam of hope ,  there he was with his ready skill ,  his bold hand ,  his encouraging voice ,  easily recognized by the enemy ,  and a conspicuous object to his own men
 mox raptum vexillum in hostem vertit quo pudore haud plures quam centum equites restitere$$ At last he was carried to such a pitch of excitement ,  that he transfixed with a lance a flying standard bearer ,  and then ,  seizing the standard ,  turned it towards the enemy
 iuvit locus , artiore illic via et fracto interfluentis rivi ponte , qui incerto alveo et praecipitibus ripis fugam impediebat ea necessitas seu fortuna lapsas iam partis restituit$$ Touched by the reproach ,  a few troopers ,  not more than a hundred in number ,  made a stand The locality favoured them ,  for the road was at that point particularly narrow ,  while the bridge over the stream which crossed it had been broken down ,  and the stream itself ,  with its varying channel and its precipitous banks ,  checked their flight
 firmati inter se densis ordinibus excipiunt Vitellianos temere effusos , atque illi consternantur$$ It was this necessity ,  or a happy chance ,  that restored the fallen fortunes of the party Forming themselves into strong and close ranks ,  they received the attack of the Vitellianists ,  who were now imprudently scattered
 Antonius instare perculsis , sternere obvios , simul ceteri , ut cuique ingenium , spoliare , capere , arma equosque abripere$$ These were at once overthrown Antonius pursued those that fled ,  and crushed those that encountered him Then came the rest of his troops ,  who ,  as they were severally disposed ,  plundered ,  made prisoners ,  or seized on weapons and horses
 et exciti prospero clamore , qui modo per agros fuga palabantur , victoriae se miscebant$$ Roused by the shouts of triumph ,  those who had lately been scattered in flight over the fields hastened to share in the victory
 Ad quartum a Cremona lapidem fulsere legionum signa Rapacis atque Italicae , laeto inter initia equitum suorum proelio illuc usque provecta sed ubi fortuna contra fuit , non laxare ordines , non recipere turbatos , non obviam ire ultroque adgredi hostem tantum per spatium cursu et pugnando fessum forte victi haud perinde rebus prosperis ducem desideraverant atque in adversis deesse intellegebant$$ At the fourth milestone from Cremona glittered the standards of two legions ,  the Italica and the Rapax ,  which had been advanced as far as that point during the success achieved by the first movement of their cavalry But when fortune changed ,  they would not open their ranks ,  nor receive the fugitives ,  nor advance and themselves attack an enemy now exhausted by so protracted a pursuit and conflict
 nutantem aciem victor equitatus incursat et Vipstanus Messala tribunus cum Moesicis auxiliaribus adsequitur , quos multi e legionariis quamquam raptim ductos aequabant$$ Vanquished by accident ,  these men had never in their success valued their general as much as they now in disaster felt his absence The victorious cavalry charged the wavering line
 ita mixtus pedes equesque rupere legionum agmen et propinqua Cremonensium moenia quanto plus spei ad effugium minorem ad resistendum animum dabant$$ the tribune Vipstanus Messalla followed with the auxiliary troops from Moesia ,  whom ,  though hurriedly brought up ,  long service had made as good soldiers as the legionaries
 nec Antonius ultra institit , memor laboris ac vulnerum , quibus tam anceps proelii fortuna , quamvis prospero fine , equites equosque adflictaverat$$ The horse and foot ,  thus mixed together ,  broke through the line of the legions The near neighbourhood of the fortifications of Cremona ,  while it gave more hope of escape ,  diminished the vigour of their resistance
 Inumbrante vespera universum Flaviani exercitus robur advenit utque cumulos super et recentia caede vestigia incessere , quasi debellatum foret , pergere Cremonam et victos in deditionem accipere aut expugnare deposcunt haec in medio , pulchra dictu$$ Antonius did not press forward ,  for he thought of the fatigue and the wounds with which a battle so hard fought ,  notwithstanding its successful termination ,  must have disabled his cavalry and their horses As the shadows of evening deepened the whole strength of the Flavianist army came up They advanced amid heaps of dead and the traces of recent slaughter ,  and ,  as if the war was over ,  demanded that they should advance to Cremona ,  and receive the capitulation of the vanquished party ,  or take the place by storm
 illa sibi quisque , posse coloniam plano sitam impetu capi$$ This was the motive alleged ,  and it sounded well ,  but what every one said to himself was this 
 idem audaciae per tenebras inrumpentibus et maiorem rapiendi licentiam$$  The colony ,  situated as it is on level ground ,  may be taken by assault
 quod si lucem opperiantur , iam pacem , iam preces , et pro labore ac vulneribus clementiam et gloriam , inania , laturos , sed opes Cremonensium in sinu praefectorum legatorumque fore$$ If we attack under cover of darkness ,  we shall be at least as bold ,  and shall enjoy more licence in plunder If we wait for the light ,  we shall be met with entreaties for peace ,  and in return for our toil and our wounds shall receive only the empty satisfaction of clemency and praise ,  but the wealth of Cremona will go into the purses of the legates and the prefects
 expugnatae urbis praedam ad militem , deditae ad duces pertinere$$ The soldiers have the plunder of a city that is stormed ,  the generals of one which capitulates
 spernuntur centuriones tribunique , ac ne vox cuiusquam audiatur , quatiunt arma , rupturi imperium ni ducantur$$ The centurions and tribunes were spurned away that no man's voice might be heard ,  the troops clashed their weapons together ,  ready to break through all discipline ,  unless they were led as they wished
 Tum Antonius inserens se manipulis , ubi aspectu et auctoritate silentium fecerat , non se decus neque pretium eripere tam bene meritis adfirmabat , sed divisa inter exercitum ducesque munia$$ Antonius then made his way into the companies When his presence and personal authority had restored silence ,  he declared ,  I would not snatch their glory or their reward from those who have deserved them so well
 militibus cupidinem pugnandi convenire , duces providendo , consultando , cunctatione saepius quam temeritate prodesse$$ Yet there is a division of duties between the army and its generals Eagerness for battle becomes the soldiers ,  but generals serve the cause by forethought ,  by counsel ,  by delay oftener than by temerity
 ut pro virili portione armis ac manu victoriam iuverit , ratione et consilio , propriis ducis artibus , profuturum$$ As I promoted your victory to the utmost of my power by my sword and by my personal exertions ,  so now I must help you by prudence and by counsel ,  the qualities which belong peculiarly to a general
 neque enim ambigua esse quae occurrant , noctem et ignotae situm urbis , intus hostis et cuncta insidiis opportuna$$ What you will have to encounter is indeed perfectly plain There will be the darkness ,  the strange localities of the town ,  the enemy inside the walls ,  and all possible facilities for ambuscades
 non si pateant portae , nisi explorato , nisi die intrandum$$ Even if the gates were wide open ,  we ought not to enter the place ,  except we had first reconnoitred it ,  and in the day-time
 an obpugnationem inchoaturos adempto omni prospectu , quis aequus locus , quanta altitudo moenium , tormentisne et telis an operibus et vineis adgredienda urbs foret$$ Shall we set about storming the town when we have no means seeing where the ground is level ,  what is the height of the walls ,  whether the city is to be assailed by our artillery and javelins ,  or by siege-works and covered approaches
 mox conversus ad singulos , num securis dolabrasque et cetera expugnandis urbibus secum attulissent , rogitabat$$ He then turned to individual soldiers ,  asking them whether they had brought with them their axes and spades and whatever else is used when towns are to be stormed
 et cum abnuerent , gladiisne inquit et pilis perfringere ac subruere muros ullae manus possunt$$ On their admitting that they had not done so ,  Can any hands ,  he answered ,  break through and undermine walls with swords and lances
 si aggerem struere , si pluteis cratibusve protegi necesse fuerit , ut vulgus improvidum inriti stabimus , altitudinem turrium et aliena munimenta mirantes$$ And if it should be found necessary to throw up an embankment and to shelter ourselves under mantlets and hurdles ,  shall we stand baffled like a thoughtless mob ,  marvelling at the height of the towers and at the enemy's defences
 quin potius mora noctis unius , advectis tormentis machinisque , vim victoriamque nobiscum ferimus$$ Shall we not rather ,  by delaying one night ,  till our artillery and engines come up ,  take with us a strength that must prevail
 simul lixas calonesque cum recentissimis equitum Bedriacum mittit , copias ceteraque usui adlaturos$$ At the same time he sent the sutlers and camp-followers with the freshest of the cavalry to Bedriacum to fetch supplies and whatever else they needed
 Id vero aegre tolerante milite prope seditionem ventum , cum progressi equites sub ipsa moenia vagos e Cremonensibus corripiunt , quorum indicio noscitur sex Vitellianas legiones omnemque exercitum , qui Hostiliae egerat , eo ipso die triginta milia passuum emensum , comperta suorum clade in proelium accingi ac iam adfore$$ The soldiers ,  however ,  were impatient ,  and a mutiny had almost broken out ,  when some cavalry ,  who had advanced to the very walls of Cremona ,  seized some stragglers from the town ,  from whose information it was ascertained ,  that the six legions of Vitellius and the entire army which had been quartered at Hostilia had on that very day marched a distance of thirty miles ,  and having heard of the defeat of their comrades ,  were preparing for battle ,  and would soon be coming up
 is terror obstructas mentis consiliis ducis aperuit$$ This alarm opened the ears that had before been deaf to their general's advice
 sistere tertiam decimam legionem in ipso viae Postumiae aggere iubet , cui iuncta a laevo septima Galbiana patenti campo stetit , dein septima Claudiana , agresti fossa (ita locus erat) praemunita$$ The 13th legion was ordered to take up its position on the raised causeway of the Via Postumia ,  supported on the left by the 7th (Galba's) which was posted in the plain ,  next came the 7th (Claudius') ,  defended in front by a field-ditch ,  such being the character of the ground
 dextro octava per apertum limitem , mox tertia densis arbustis intersepta$$ On the right was the 8th legion ,  drawn up in an open space ,  and then the 3rd ,  whose ranks were divided by some thick brushwood
 hic aquilarum signorumque ordo$$ Such was the arrangement of the eagles and the standards
 milites mixti per tenebras , ut fors tulerat$$ The soldiers were mingled in the darkness as accident had determined
 praetorianum vexillum proximum tertianis , cohortes auxiliorum in cornibus , latera ac terga equite circumdata$$ The Praetorian colours were close to the 3rd legion the auxiliary infantry were stationed on the wings
 Sido atque Italicus Suebi cum delectis popularium primori in acie versabantur$$ the cavalry covered the flanks and the rear Sido and Italicus ,  the Suevian chieftains ,  with a picked body of their countrymen ,  manoeuvred in the van
 At Vitellianus exercitus , cui adquiescere Cremonae et reciperatis cibo somnoque viribus confectum algore atque inedia hostem postera die profligare ac proruere ratio fuit , indigus rectoris , inops consilii , tertia ferme noctis hora paratis iam dispositisque Flavianis impingitur$$ It would have been the best policy for the army of Vitellius to rest at Cremona ,  and ,  with strength recruited by food and repose ,  to attack and crush the next day an enemy exhausted by cold and hunger but now ,  wanting a leader ,  and having no settled plan ,  they came into collision about nine o'clock at night with the Flavianist troops ,  who stood ready ,  and in order of battle
 ordinem agminis disiecti per iram ac tenebras adseverare non ausim , quamquam alii tradiderint quartam Macedonicam dextrum suorum cornu , quintam et quintam decimam cum vexillis nonae secundaeque et vicensimae Britannicarum legionum mediam aciem , sextadecimanos duoetvicensimanosque et primanos laevum cornu complesse$$ Respecting the disposition of the Vitellianist army ,  disordered as it was by its fury and by the darkness ,  I would not venture to speak positively Some ,  however ,  have related ,  that on the right wing was the 4th legion (the Macedonian) that the 5th and 15th ,  with the veterans of three British legions (the 9th ,  2nd ,  and 20th) ,  formed the centre ,  while the left wing was made up of the 1st ,  the 16th ,  and the 22nd
 Rapaces atque Italici omnibus se manipulis miscuerant$$ Men of the legions Rapax and Italica were mingled with all the companies
 eques auxiliaque sibi ipsi locum legere$$ The cavalry and the auxiliaries chose their position themselves
 proelium tota nocte varium , anceps , atrox , his , rursus illis exitiabile$$ Throughout the night the battle raged in many forms ,  indecisive and fierce ,  destructive ,  first to one side ,  then to the other
 nihil animus aut manus , ne oculi quidem provisu iuvabant$$ Courage ,  strength ,  even the eye with its keenest sight ,  were of no avail
 eadem utraque acie arma , crebris interrogationibus notum pugnae signum , permixta vexilla , ut quisque globus capta ex hostibus huc vel illuc raptabat$$ Both armies fought with the same weapons the watch-word ,  continually asked ,  became known the colours were confused together ,  as parties of combatants snatched them from the enemy ,  and hurried them in this or that direction
 urgebatur maxime septima legio , nuper a Galba conscripta$$ The 7th legion ,  recently levied by Galba ,  was the hardest pressed
 occisi sex primorum ordinum centuriones , abrepta quaedam signa$$ Six centurions of the first rank were killed ,  and some of the standards taken
 ipsam aquilam Atilius Verus primi pili centurio multa cum hostium strage et ad extremum moriens servaverat$$ but the eagle was saved by Atilius Verus ,  the centurion of the first company ,  who ,  after making a great slaughter among the enemy ,  at last fell
 Sustinuit labentem aciem Antonius accitis praetorianis$$ The line was supported ,  as it began to waver ,  by Antonius ,  who brought up the Praetorians
 qui ubi excepere pugnam , pellunt hostem , dein pelluntur$$ They took up the conflict ,  repulsed the enemy ,  and were then themselves repulsed
 namque Vitelliani tormenta in aggerem viae contulerant ut tela vacuo atque aperto excuterentur , dispersa primo et arbustis sine hostium noxa inlisa$$ The troops of Vitellius had collected their artillery on the raised causeway ,  where there was a free and open space for the discharge of the missiles ,  which at first had been scattered at random ,  and had struck against the trees without injury to the enemy
 magnitudine eximia quintae decimae legionis ballista ingentibus saxis hostilem aciem proruebat lateque cladem intulisset ni duo milites praeclarum facinus ausi , arreptis e strage scutis ignorati , vincla ac libramenta tormentorum abscidissent$$ An engine of remarkable size ,  belonging to the 15th legion ,  was crushing the hostile ranks with huge stones ,  and would have spread destruction far and wide ,  had not two soldiers ventured on a deed of surpassing bravery Disguising themselves with shields snatched from the midst of the carnage ,  they cut the ropes and springs of the engine
 statim confossi sunt eoque intercidere nomina$$ They were instantly slain ,  and their names have consequently been lost
 de facto haud ambigitur$$ but the fact is undoubted
 neutro inclinaverat fortuna donec adulta nocte luna surgens ostenderet acies falleretque$$ Fortune favoured neither side ,  till at a late hour of the night the moon rose and showed ,  but showed deceptively ,  both armies
 sed Flavianis aequior a tergo$$ The light ,  however ,  shining from behind ,  favoured the Flavianists
 hinc maiores equorum virorumque umbrae , et falso , ut in corpora , ictu tela hostium citra cadebant Vitelliani adverso lumine conlucentes velut ex occulto iaculantibus incauti offerebantur$$ With them a lengthened shadow fell from men and horses ,  and the enemy's missiles ,  incorrectly aimed at what seemed the substance ,  fell short ,  while the Vitellianists ,  who had the light shining on their faces ,  were unconsciously exposed to an enemy who were ,  so to speak ,  concealed while they aimed
 Igitur Antonius , ubi noscere suos noscique poterat , alios pudore et probris , multos laude et hortatu , omnis spe promissisque accendens , cur resumpsissent arma , Pannonicas legiones interrogabat$$ As soon as Antonius could recognize his men and be recognized by them ,  he sought to kindle their courage ,  striving to shame some with his reproaches ,  stirring many with praise and encouragement ,  and all with hopes and promises
 illos esse campos , in quibus abolere labem prioris ignominiae , ubi reciperare gloriam possent$$ Why ,  he demanded of the legions of Pannonia ,  have you again taken up arms
 tum ad Moesicos conversus principes auctoresque belli ciebat$$ Yonder is the field where you may wipe out the stain of past disgrace ,  and redeem your honour
 frustra minis et verbis provocatos Vitellianos , si manus eorum oculosque non tolerent$$ Then turning to the troops of Moesia ,  he appealed to them as the authors and originators of the war
 haec , ut quosque accesserat plura ad tertianos , veterum recentiumque admonens , ut sub Marcus Antonio Parthos , sub Corbulone Armenios , nuper Sarmatas pepulissent mox infensus praetorianis vos inquit , nisi vincitis , pagani , quis alius imperator , quae castra alia excipient$$ Idly ,  he said have you challenged the Vitellianists with threatening words ,  if you cannot abide their attack or even their looks So he spoke to each as he approached them The third legion he addressed at greater length ,  reminding them of old and recent achievements ,  how under Marcus Antonius they had defeated the Parthians ,  under Corbulo the Armenians ,  and had lately discomfited the Sarmatians
 illic signa armaque vestra sunt , et mors victis nam ignominiam consumpsistis$$ Then angrily turning to the Praetorians ,  Clowns ,  said he ,  unless you are victorious ,  what other general ,  what other camp will receive you
 undique clamor , et orientem solem (ita in Syria mos est) tertiani salutavere$$ There are your colours and your arms defeat is death ,  for disgrace you have exhausted
 Vagus inde an consilio ducis subditus rumor , advenisse Mucianum , exercitus in vicem salutasse$$ A vague rumour thus arose ,  or was intentionally suggested by the general ,  that Mucianus had arrived ,  and that the two armies had exchanged salutations
 gradum inferunt quasi recentibus auxiliis aucti , rariore iam Vitellianorum acie , ut quos nullo rectore suus quemque impetus vel pavor contraheret diduceretve$$ The men then charged as confidently as if they had been strengthened by fresh reinforcements ,  while the enemy's array was now less compact for ,  as there was no one to command ,  it was now contracted ,  now extended ,  as the courage or fear of individual soldiers might prompt
 postquam impulsos sensit Antonius , denso agmine obturbabat$$ Antonius ,  seeing that they gave way ,  charged them with a heavy column

 Iulius Mansuetus ex Hispania , Rapaci legioni additus , impubem filium domi liquerat$$ Julius Mansuetus ,  a Spaniard ,  enlisting in the legion Rapax ,  had left at home a son of tender age
 is mox adultus , inter septimanos a Galba conscriptus , oblatum forte patrem et vulnere stratum dum semianimem scrutatur , agnitus agnoscensque et exanguem amplexus , voce flebili precabatur placatos patris manis , neve se ut parricidam aversarentur$$ The lad grew up to manhood ,  and was enrolled by Galba in the 7th legion Now chancing to meet his father ,  he brought him to the ground with a wound ,  and ,  as he rifled his dying foe ,  recognized him ,  and was himself recognized Clasping the expiring man in his arms ,  in piteous accents he implored the spirit of his father to be propitious to him ,  and not to turn from him with loathing as from a parricide
 publicum id facinus$$ This guilt ,  he said ,  is shared by all
 et unum militem quotam civilium armorum partem$$ how small a part of a civil war is a single soldier! With these words he raised the body ,  opened a grave ,  and discharged the last duties for his father

 at Romae senatus cuncta principibus solita Vespasiano decernit , laetus et spei certus , quippe sumpta per Gallias Hispaniasque civilia arma , motis ad bellum Germaniis , mox Illyrico , postquam Aegyptum Iudaeam Syriamque et omnis provincias exercitusque lustraverant , velut expiato terrarum orbe cepisse finem videbantur$$ At Rome the Senate ,  delighted and full of confident hope ,  decreed to Vespasian all the honours customarily bestowed on the Emperors And indeed the civil war ,  which ,  beginning in Gaul and Spain ,  and afterwards drawing into the struggle first Germany and then Illyricum ,  had traversed Aegypt ,  Judaea ,  and Syria ,  every province ,  and every army ,  this war ,  now that the whole earth was ,  as it were ,  purged from guilt ,  seemed to have reached its close

 Lupercus legionarios e praesentibus , Vbios e proximis , Trevirorum equites haud longe agentis raptim transmisit , addita Batavorum ala , quae iam pridem corrupta fidem simulabat , ut proditis in ipsa acie Romanis maiore pretio fugeret$$ Lupercus in great haste threw across the Rhine such legionaries as were on the spot ,  some Ubian troops who were close at hand ,  and some cavalry of the Treveri ,  who were stationed at no great distance these were accompanied by some Batavian horse ,  who ,  though they had been long disaffected ,  yet still simulated loyalty in order that by betraying the Romans in the moment of actual conflict they might receive a higher price for their desertion
 Civilis captarum cohortium signis circumdatus , ut suo militi recens gloria ante oculos et hostes memoria cladis terrerentur , matrem suam sororesque , simul omnium coniuges parvosque liberos consistere a tergo iubet , hortamenta victoriae vel pulsis pudorem$$ Civilis ,  surrounding himself with the standards of the captured cohorts ,  to keep their recent honours before the eyes of his own men ,  and to terrify the enemy by the remembrance of defeat ,  now directed his own mother and sisters ,  and the wives and children of all his men ,  to stand in the rear ,  where they might encourage to victory ,  or shame defeat
 ut virorum cantu , feminarum ululatu sonuit acies , nequaquam par a legionibus cohortibusque redditur clamor$$ The war-song of the men ,  and the shrill cries of the women ,  rose from the whole line ,  and an answering but far less vigorous cheer ,  came from the legions and auxiliaries
 nudaverat sinistrum cornu Batavorum ala transfugiens statimque in nos versa$$ The Batavians had exposed the left wing by their desertion ,  and they immediately turned against our men
 sed legionarius miles , quamquam rebus trepidis , arma ordinesque retinebat$$ Still the legionaries ,  though their position was alarming ,  kept their arms and their ranks
 Vbiorum Trevirorumque auxilia foeda fuga dispersa totis campis palantur$$ The auxiliaries of the Ubii and the Treveri broke at once in shameful flight ,  and dispersed over the whole country
 illuc incubuere Germani , et fuit interim effugium legionibus in castra , quibus Veterum nomen est$$ On that side the Germans threw the weight of their attack
 praefectus alae Batavorum Claudius Labeo , oppidano certamine aemulus Civili , ne interfectus invidiam apud popularis vel , si retineretur , semina discordiae praeberet , in Frisios avehitur$$ Meanwhile the legions had an opportunity of retreating into what was called the Old Camp Claudius Labeo ,  prefect of the Batavian horse ,  who had been the rival of Civilis in some local contest ,  was sent away into the country of the Frisii
 Isdem diebus Batavorum et Canninefatium cohortis , cum iussu Vitellii in urbem pergerent , missus a Civile nuntius adsequitur$$ About the same time the messenger despatched by Civilis came up with the cohorts of the Batavians and the Canninefates ,  while by the orders of Vitellius they were advancing towards Rome
 intumuere statim superbia ferociaque et pretium itineris donativum , duplex stipendium , augeri equitum numerum , promissa sane a Vitellio , postulabant , non ut adsequerentur , sed causam seditioni$$ At once ,  inflated with pride and haughtiness ,  they demanded ,  by way of remuneration for their march ,  a donative ,  double pay ,  and an increase in the number of cavalry ,  things indeed which Vitellius had promised ,  but which they now asked ,  not with the thought of obtaining them ,  but as a pretext for mutiny
 et Flaccus multa concedendo nihil aliud effecerat quam ut acrius exposcerent quae sciebant negaturum$$ Flaccus ,  by his many concessions ,  had produced no other effect but to make them insist with more energy on what they knew he must refuse
 spreto Flacco inferiorem Germaniam petivere ut Civili iungerentur$$ Treating him with contempt ,  they made their way towards Lower Germany ,  to join Civilis
 Hordeonius adhibitis tribunis centurionibusque consultavit num obsequium abnuentis vi coerceret$$ Hordeonius ,  assembling the tribunes and centurions ,  asked their opinion as to whether he should use coercion with those who refused obedience
 mox insita ignavia et trepidis ministris , quos ambiguus auxiliorum animus et subito dilectu suppletae legiones angebant , statuit continere intra castra militem$$ Soon ,  yielding to his natural timidity and to the alarm of his officers ,  who were troubled by the suspicious temper of the auxiliaries and by the fact that the ranks of the legions had been recruited by a hurried conscription ,  he resolved to confine his troops to the camp
 dein paenitentia et arguentibus ipsis qui suaserant , tamquam secuturus scripsit Herennio Gallo legionis primae legato , qui Bonnam obtinebat , ut arceret transitu Batavos$$ Then ,  repenting of his resolve ,  and finding that the very men who had advised it now disapproved it ,  he seemed bent on pursuing the enemy ,  and wrote to Herennius Gallus ,  legate of the first legion ,  who was then holding Bonna ,  that he was to prevent the Batavians from crossing the Rhine ,  and that he would himself hang on their rear with his army
 se cum exercitu tergis eorum haesurum$$ They might have been crushed ,  if Hordeonius ,  moving from one side ,  and Gallus from the other ,  had enclosed them between their armies
 et opprimi poterant si hinc Hordeonius , inde Gallus , motis utrimque copiis , medios clausissent$$ But Flaccus abandoned his purpose ,  and ,  in other despatches to Gallus ,  recommended him not to threaten the departing foe
 Flaccus omisit inceptum aliisque litteris Gallum monuit ne terreret abeuntis unde suspicio sponte legatorum excitari bellum cunctaque quae acciderant aut metuebantur non inertia militis neque hostium vi , sed fraude ducum evenire$$ Thence arose a suspicion that the war was being kindled with the consent of the legates ,  and that everything which had happened ,  or was apprehended ,  was due ,  not to the cowardice of the troops ,  or to the strength of the enemy ,  but to the treachery of the generals
 Batavi cum castris Bonnensibus propinquarent , praemisere qui Herennio Gallo mandata cohortium exponeret$$ When the Batavians were near the camp at Bonna ,  they sent on before them delegates ,  commissioned to deliver to Herennius Gallus a message from the cohorts
 nullum sibi bellum adversus Romanos , pro quibus totiens bellassent$$ It was to this effect 
 longa atque inrita militia fessis patriae atque otii cupidinem esse$$  We have no quarrel with the Romans ,  for whom we have so often fought
 si nemo obsisteret , innoxium iter fore$$ Wearied with a protracted and fruitless service ,  we long for our native land and for rest
 sin arma occurrant , ferro viam inventuros$$ If no one oppose us ,  our march will be harmless ,  but if an armed force encounter us ,  we will make a way with the sword
 cunctantem legatum milites perpulerant fortunam proelii experiretur$$ The soldiers prevailed upon the hesitating legate to risk the chances of a battle
 tria milia legionariorum et tumultuariae Belgarum cohortes , simul paganorum lixarumque ignava sed procax ante periculum manus omnibus portis prorumpunt ut Batavos numero imparis circumfundant$$ Three thousand legionaries ,  some raw Belgian cohorts ,  and with them a mob of rustics and camp-followers ,  cowardly ,  but bold of speech before the moment of danger ,  rushed out of all the gates ,  thinking to surround the Batavians ,  who were inferior in number
 illi veteres militiae in cuneos congregantur , densi undique et frontem tergaque ac latus tuti$$ But the enemy ,  being veteran troops ,  formed in columns ,  presenting on every side a dense array ,  with front ,  flanks ,  and rear secure
 sic tenuem nostrorum aciem perfringunt$$ Thus they were able to break the thin line of our soldiers
 cedentibus Belgis pellitur legio , et vallum portasque trepidi petebant$$ The Belgians giving way ,  the legion was driven back ,  retreating in confusion on the entrenchments and the gates
 ibi plurimum cladis$$ It was there that the greatest slaughter took place
 cumulatae corporibus fossae , nec caede tantum et vulneribus , sed ruina et suis plerique telis interiere$$ The trenches were heaped up with corpses Nor was it only from the deadly blows of the enemy that they suffered
 victores colonia Agrippinensium vitata , nihil cetero in itinere hostile ausi , Bonnense proelium excusabant , tamquam petita pace , postquam negabatur , sibimet ipsi consuluissent$$ many perished in the crush and by their own weapons The victorious army ,  who avoided the Colonia Agrippinensis ,  did not venture on any other hostile act during the remainder of their march ,  and excused the conflict at Bonna ,  alleging that they had asked for peace ,  and that when it was refused they had but looked to their own safety
 Civilis adventu veteranarum cohortium iusti iam exercitus ductor , sed consilii ambiguus et vim Romanam reputans , cunctos qui aderant in verba Vespasiani adigit mittitque legatos ad duas legiones , quae priore acie pulsae in Vetera castra concesserant , ut idem sacramentum acciperent$$ Civilis ,  who now on the arrival of these veteran cohorts was at the head of a complete army ,  but who was undecided in his plans ,  and still reflected on the power of Rome ,  made all who were with him swear allegiance to Vespasian ,  and sent envoys to the two legions which after their defeat in the previous engagement had retreated into the Old Camp ,  advising them to accept the same allegiance
 redditur responsum$$ Their reply was 
 neque proditoris neque hostium se consiliis uti$$  We do not follow the advice of traitors or enemies
 esse sibi Vitellium principem , pro quo fidem et arma usque ad supremum spiritum retenturos$$ Vitellius is our Emperor to him we will retain our fealty and devote our swords till our last breath
 proinde perfuga Batavus arbitrium rerum Romanarum ne ageret , sed meritas sceleris poenas expectaret$$ Then let not a Batavian refugee affect to decide the destinies of Rome let him rather await the merited penalty of his guilt
 quae ubi relata Civili , incensus ira universam Batavorum gentem in arma rapit$$ When this reply was delivered to Civilis ,  he was furious with anger ,  and hurried the whole Batavian nation into open war
 iunguntur Bructeri Tencterique et excita nuntiis Germania ad praedam famamque$$ The Bructeri and the Tencteri joined him ,  and messengers summoned all Germany to share in his plunder and his glory
 Adversus has concurrentis belli minas legati legionum Munius Lupercus et Numisius Rufus vallum murosque firmabant$$ To meet the threatened dangers of the gathering war ,  the legates of the legions ,  Munius Lupercus and Numisius Rufus ,  strengthened their entrenchments and walls
 subversa longae pacis opera , haud procul castris in modum municipii extructa , ne hostibus usui forent$$ The buildings ,  which during a long period of peace had grown up like a town near the camp ,  were destroyed ,  lest they might be useful to the enemy
 sed parum provisum ut copiae in castra conveherentur$$ Little care ,  however ,  was taken about the conveyance of supplies into the camp
 rapi permisere$$ These the generals allowed to be plundered
 ita paucis diebus per licentiam absumpta sunt quae adversus necessitates in longum suffecissent$$ and so ,  what might long have sufficed for their necessities ,  was wantonly wasted in a few days
 Civilis medium agmen cum robore Batavorum obtinens utramque Rheni ripam , quo truculentior visu foret , Germanorum catervis complet , adsultante per campos equite$$ Civilis ,  who occupied the centre of the army with the elite of the Batavian troops ,  wishing to add a new terror to his demonstration ,  covered both banks of the Rhine with columns of his German allies ,  while his cavalry galloped about the plains
 simul naves in adversum amnem agebantur$$ At the same time the fleet was moved up the stream
 hinc veteranarum cohortium signa , inde depromptae silvis lucisque ferarum imagines , ut cuique genti inire proelium mos est , mixta belli civilis externique facie obstupefecerant obsessos$$ Here were the standards of the veteran cohorts there the images of wild beasts ,  brought out of the woods and sacred groves ,  under the various forms which each tribe is used to follow into battle ,  and these mingled emblems of civil and of foreign warfare utterly confounded the besieged
 et spem obpugnantium augebat amplitudo valli , quod duabus legionibus situm vix quinque milia armatorum Romanorum tuebantur$$ The extent of the entrenchment raised the hopes of the besiegers Constructed for two legions ,  it was now held by not more than five thousand Roman soldiers
 sed lixarum multitudo turbata pace illuc congregata et bello ministra aderat$$ But there was with them a great number of camp-followers ,  who had assembled there on the disturbance of peace ,  and who could be employed in the contest
 Pars castrorum in collem leniter exurgens , pars aequo adibatur$$ Part of the camp occupied the gentle slope of a hill
 quippe illis hibernis obsideri premique Germanias Augustus crediderat , neque umquam id malorum ut obpugnatum ultro legiones nostras venirent$$ to part was a level approach By this encampment Augustus had thought the German tribes might be watched and checked
 inde non loco neque munimentis labor additus$$ never had he contemplated such a pitch of disaster ,  as that these tribes should themselves advance to attack our legions
 vis et arma satis placebant$$ Hence no labour was bestowed on the ground or on the defences
 Batavi Transrhenanique , quo discreta virtus manifestius spectaretur , sibi quaeque gens consistunt , eminus lacessentes$$ Our valour and our arms seemed defence enough The Batavians and the Transrhenane tribes took up their position ,  each tribe by itself ,  to distinguish and so the better to display the valour of each
 post ubi pleraque telorum turribus pinnisque moenium inrita haerebant et desuper saxis vulnerabantur , clamore atque impetu invasere vallum , adpositis plerique scalis , alii per testudinem suorum$$ first annoying us by a distant volley then ,  as they found that very many of their missiles fixed themselves harmlessly in the turrets and battlements of the walls ,  and they themselves suffered from the stones showered down on them ,  they fell on the entrenchment with a shout and furious rush ,  many placing their scaling-ladders against the ramparts ,  and others mounting on a testudo formed by their comrades
 scandebantque iam quidam , cum gladiis et armorum incussu praecipitati sudibus et pilis obruuntur , praeferoces initio et rebus secundis nimii$$ Some were in the act of climbing over when they were thrust down by the swords of the enemy ,  and fell overwhelmed by a storm of javelins and stakes
 sed tum praedae cupidine adversa quoque tolerabant$$ Always very daring at first and excessively elated by success ,  they now in their eagerness for plunder bore up against reverse
 machinas etiam , insolitum sibi , ausi$$ They also ventured to use what to them was a novelty ,  engines of war
 nec ulla ipsis sollertia perfugae captivique docebant struere materias in modum pontis , mox subiectis rotis propellere , ut alii superstantes tamquam ex aggere proeliarentur , pars intus occulti muros subruerent$$ they had themselves no skill in handling them ,  but the prisoners and deserters taught them to pile up timber in the shape of a bridge ,  under which they put wheels ,  and so propelled it ,  some standing on the top ,  and fighting as they would from an earth-work ,  others concealing themselves within and undermining the walls
 sed excussa ballistis saxa stravere informe opus et cratis vineasque parantibus adactae tormentis ardentes hastae , ultroque ipsi obpugnatores ignibus petebantur , donec desperata vi verterent consilium ad moras , haud ignari paucorum dierum inesse alimenta et multum imbellis turbae$$ But the stones thrown by the catapults prostrated the ill-constructed fabric ,  and when they set themselves to prepare hurdles and mantlets ,  burning spears were thrown on them by the engines ,  fire being thus actually used against the assailants At last ,  despairing of success by force ,  they changed their plans ,  and resolved to wait ,  for they were well aware that only a few days' provisions were in the camp ,  and that there was a great crowd on non-combatants
 simul ex inopia proditio et fluxa servitiorum fides ac fortuita belli sperabantur$$ and they counted at the same time on the treachery that might follow on scarcity ,  on the wavering fidelity of the slaves ,  and on the chances of war
 Flaccus interim cognito castrorum obsidio et missis per Gallias qui auxilia concirent , lectos e legionibus Dillio Voculae duoetvicensimae legionis legato tradit , ut quam maximis per ripam itineribus celeraret , ipse navibus <invadit> invalidus corpore , invisus militibus$$ Meanwhile Flaccus ,  who had heard of the siege of the camp ,  and had sent into all parts of Gaul to collect auxiliaries ,  put under command of Dillius Vocula ,  legate of the 18th legion ,  some troops picked from the legions with orders to hasten by forced marches along the banks of the Rhine Flaccus himself ,  who was weak in health and disliked by his troops ,  travelled with the fleet
 neque enim ambigue fremebant emissas a Mogontiaco Batavorum cohortis , dissimulatos Civilis conatus , adsciri in societatem Germanos$$ The troops indeed complained in unmistakable language that their general had despatched the Batavian cohorts from Mogontiacum ,  had feigned ignorance of the plans of Civilis ,  and was inviting the German tribes to join the league
 non Primi Antonii neque Muciani ope Vespasianum magis adolevisse$$ This ,  they said ,  has strengthened Vespasian no less than the exertions of Primus Antonius and Mucianus
 aperta odia armaque palam depelli$$ Declared enmity and hostility may be openly repulsed ,  but treachery and fraud work in darkness ,  and so cannot be avoided
 fraudem et dolum obscura eoque inevitabilia$$ Civilis stands in arms against us ,  and arranges the order of his battle
 Civilem stare contra , struere aciem$$ Hordeonius from his chamber or his litter gives such orders as may best serve the enemy
 Hordeonium e cubiculo et lectulo iubere quidquid hosti conducat$$ The swords of thousands of brave men are directed by one old man's sick caprice
 tot armatas fortissimorum virorum manus unius senis valetudine regi quin potius interfecto traditore fortunam virtutemque suam malo omine exolverent his inter se vocibus instinctos flammavere insuper adlatae a Vespasiano litterae , quas Flaccus , quia occultari nequibant , pro contione recitavit , vinctosque qui attulerant ad Vitellium misit$$ How much better by slaying the traitor ,  to set free our valour and our fortune from these evil auspices! The passions already kindled by the language which they thus held among themselves were yet more inflamed by a despatch from Vespasian ,  which Flaccus ,  finding that it could not be concealed ,  read before an assembly of the troops ,  sending the persons who had brought it in chains to Vitellius
 Sic mitigatis animis Bonnam , hiberna primae legionis , ventum$$ With feelings somewhat appeased ,  they arrived at Bonna ,  the winter-camp of the first legion
 infensior illic miles culpam cladis in Hordeonium vertebat$$ The troops there were even more enraged against Hordeonius ,  and laid on him the blame of the late disaster
 eius iussu derectam adversus Batavos aciem , tamquam a Mogontiaco legiones sequerentur$$ They said that it was by his orders that they had offered battle to the Batavians ,  supposing that the legions from Mogontiacum were following them
 eiusdem proditione caesos , nullis supervenientibus auxiliis$$ that it was through his treachery that they had been slaughtered ,  no reinforcements coming up
 ignota haec ceteris exercitibus neque imperatori suo nuntiari , cum adcursu tot provinciarum extingui repens perfidia potuerit$$ that all these events were unknown to the other legions ,  and were not told to their Emperor ,  though the sudden outburst of treason might have been crushed by the prompt action of so many provinces
 Hordeonius exemplaris omnium litterarum , quibus per Gallias Britanniamque et Hispanias auxilia orabat , exercitui recitavit instituitque pessimum facinus , ut epistulae aquiliferis legionum traderentur , a quis ante militi quam ducibus legebantur$$ Hordeonius read to the army copies of all the letters which he had sent about Gaul ,  begging for reinforcements ,  and established as a precedent a most disgraceful practice ,  namely ,  the handing over the despatches to the standard-bearers of the legions ,  through whose means they were read by the soldiers sooner than by the generals
 tum e seditiosis unum vinciri iubet , magis usurpandi iuris , quam quia unius culpa foret$$ He then ordered one of the mutineers to be put in irons ,  more for the sake of asserting his authority than because any one man was in fault
 motusque Bonna exercitus in coloniam Agrippinensem , adfluentibus auxiliis Gallorum , qui primo rem Romanam enixe iuvabant$$ The army was then moved from Bonna to the Colonia Agrippinensis ,  while auxiliaries from Gaul continued to flow in
 mox valescentibus Germanis pleraeque civitates adversum nos arma <sumpsere> spe libertatis et , si exuissent servitium , cupidine imperitandi$$ for at first that nation zealously supported the cause of Rome Soon indeed as the Germans increased in power ,  many of the states took up arms against us ,  moved by the hope of freedom and ,  could they once shake off the yoke ,  even by the lust of empire
 gliscebat iracundia legionum , nec terrorem unius militis vincula indiderant$$ The irritation of the legions still increased ,  nor had the imprisonment of a single soldier struck them with terror
 quin idem ille arguebat ultro conscientiam ducis , tamquam nuntius inter Civilem Flaccumque falso crimine testis veri opprimeretur$$ This fellow indeed actually charged the general with complicity he had ,  he said ,  acted as a messenger between Civilis and Flaccus ,  and because he might tell the truth he was now being crushed under a false charge
 conscendit tribunal Vocula mira constantia , prensumque militem ac vociferantem duci ad supplicium iussit$$ With wonderful firmness Vocula ascended the tribunal ,  and ordered the man ,  who had been seized by the lictors ,  and was loudly remonstrating ,  to be led off to execution
 et dum mali pavent , optimus quisque iussis paruere$$ All the best men acquiesced in the order ,  while the ill-affected were struck with terror
 exim consensu ducem Voculam poscentibus , Flaccus summam rerum ei permisit$$ Then ,  as all with common consent demanded that Vocula should be their general ,  Hordeonius handed over to him the supreme command
 Sed discordis animos multa efferabant$$ But there were many things to exasperate the already divided feelings of the soldiery
 inopia stipendii frumentique et simul dilectum tributaque Galliae aspernantes , Rhenus incognita illi caelo siccitate vix navium patiens , arti commeatus , dispositae per omnem ripam stationes quae Germanos vado arcerent , eademque de causa minus frugum et plures qui consumerent$$ Pay and provisions were scanty ,  Gaul was rebelling against conscription and taxes ,  while the Rhine ,  owing to a drought unexampled in that climate ,  would hardly admit of navigation ,  and thus supplies were straitened at the same time that outposts had to be established along the entire bank to keep the Germans from fording the stream the self-same cause thus bringing about a smaller supply of grain and a greater number of consumers
 apud imperitos prodigii loco accipiebatur ipsa aquarum penuria , tamquam nos amnes quoque et vetera imperii munimenta desererent$$ Among ignorant persons the very failure of the stream was regarded as a prodigy ,  as if the very rivers ,  the old defences of the Empire ,  were deserting us

 additus Voculae in partem curarum Herennius Gallus legatus$$ Herennius Gallus ,  its legate ,  was associated with Vocula in the responsibilities of command
 nec ausi ad hostem pergere * * (loco Gelduba nomen est) castra fecere$$ As they did not venture to advance upon the enemy ,  they constructed a camp at a place called Gelduba
 ibi struenda acie , muniendo vallandoque et ceteris belli meditamentis militem firmabant$$ Here the generals sought to give steadiness to the troops by such exercises as forming in order of battle ,  constructing fortifications ,  making entrenchments ,  and whatever else might train them for war
 utque praeda ad virtutem accenderetur , in proximos Cugernorum pagos , qui societatem Civilis acceperant , ductus a Vocula exercitus$$ In the hope that they might be fired to courage by the delights of plunder ,  Vocula led the army against the nearest villages of the Gugerni ,  who had accepted the alliance of Civilis
 pars cum Herennio Gallo permansit$$ Some of the troops remained permanently with Herennius Gallus
 Forte navem haud procul castris , frumento gravem , cum per vada haesisset , Germani in suam ripam trahebant$$ One day it happened that at no great distance from the camp the Germans were endeavouring to drag off to their own bank a vessel laden with corn ,  which had run aground in the shallows

 illum auctorem sceleris , hunc ministrum vocant , donec exitium minitantibus exterritus proditionem et ipse Hordeonio obiecit$$ He ,  they declared ,  was the instigator of the crime ,  Gallus his tool At last ,  utterly terrified by their threats of instant death ,  the legate himself charged Hordeonius with treachery
 vinctusque adventu demum Voculae exolvitur is postera die auctores seditionis morte adfecit$$ He was then put in irons ,  and only released on the arrival of Vocula ,  who the next day inflicted capital punishment on the ringleaders of the mutiny
 tanta illi exercitui diversitas inerat licentiae patientiaeque$$ such wide extremes of license and of subordination were to be found in that army
 haud dubie gregarius miles Vitellio fidus , splendidissimus quisque in Vespasianum proni$$ The common soldiers were undoubtedly loyal to Vitellius ,  but all the most distinguished men were in favour of Vespasian
 inde scelerum ac suppliciorum vices et mixtus obsequio furor , ut contineri non possent qui puniri poterant$$ The result was an alternation of outbreaks and executions ,  and a strange mixture of obedience and frenzy ,  which made it impossible to restrain the men whom it was yet possible to punish
 At Civilem immensis auctibus universa Germania extollebat , societate nobilissimis obsidum firmata$$ Meanwhile all Germany was raising the power of Civilis by vast additions of strength ,  and the alliance was secured by hostages of the noblest rank
 ille , ut cuique proximum , vastari Vbios Trevirosque , et aliam manum Mosam amnem transire iubet , ut Menapios et Morinos et extrema Galliarum quateret$$ He directed that the territories of the Ubii and the Treveri should be ravaged by the several tribes on which they bordered ,  and that another detachment should cross the river Mosa ,  to threaten the Menapii and the Morini and the frontiers of Gaul
 actae utrobique praedae , infestius in Vbiis , quod gens Germanicae originis eiurata patria Romanorum nomen Agrippinenses vocarentur$$ In both quarters plunder was collected with peculiar hostility in the case of the Ubii ,  because ,  this nation ,  being of German origin ,  had forsworn its native country ,  and assumed the Roman name of the Agrippinenses
 caesae cohortes eorum in vico Marcoduro incuriosius agentes , quia procul ripa aberant$$ Their cohorts were cut up at the village of Marcodurum ,  where they lay in careless security ,  presuming on their distance from the river-bank
 nec quievere Vbii quo minus praedas e Germania peterent , primo impune , dein circumventi sunt , per omne id bellum meliore usi fide quam fortuna$$ The Ubii did not remain quiet ,  but made predatory excursions into Germany ,  escaping at first with impunity ,  though they were afterwards cut off Throughout the whole of this war ,  they were more loyal than fortunate
 contusis Vbiis gravior et successu rerum ferocior Civilis obsidium legionum urgebat , intentis custodiis ne quis occultus nuntius venientis auxilii penetraret$$ Civilis ,  grown more formidable now that the Ubii had been crushed ,  and elated by the success of his operations ,  pressed on the siege of the legions ,  keeping a strict watch to prevent any secret intelligence of advancing succours from reaching them
 machinas molemque operum Batavis delegat Transrhenanos proelium poscentis ad scindendum vallum ire detrusosque redintegrare certamen iubet , superante multitudine et facili damno$$ He entrusted to the Batavians the care of the machines and the vast siege-works ,  and when the Transrhenane tribes clamoured for battle ,  he bade them go and cut through the ramparts ,  and ,  if repulsed ,  renew the struggle
 Nec finem labori nox attulit congestis circum lignis accensisque , simul epulantes , ut quisque vino incaluerat , ad pugnam temeritate inani ferebantur$$ Piling up logs of wood round the walls and lighting them ,  they sat feasting ,  and rushed to the conflict ,  as each grew heated with wine ,  with a useless daring
 quippe ipsorum tela per tenebras vana Romani conspicuam barbarorum aciem , et si quis audacia aut insignibus effulgens , ad ictum destinabant$$ Their missiles were discharged without effect in the darkness ,  but to the Romans the ranks of the barbarians were plainly discernible ,  and they singled out with deliberate aim anyone whose boldness or whose decorations made him conspicuous
 intellectum id Civili et restincto igne misceri cuncta tenebris et armis iubet$$ Civilis saw this ,  and ,  extinguishing the fires ,  threw the confusion of darkness over the attack
 tum vero strepitus dissoni , casus incerti , neque feriendi neque declinandi providentia$$ Then ensued a scene of discordant clamour ,  of accident ,  and uncertainty ,  where no one could see how to aim or to avoid a blow
 unde clamor acciderat , circumagere corpora , tendere artus$$ Wherever a shout was heard ,  they wheeled round and strained hand and foot

 apud Germanos inconsulta ira$$ The Germans fought with inconsiderate fury
 Romanus miles periculorum gnarus ferratas sudis , gravia saxa non forte iaciebat$$ our men ,  more alive to the danger ,  threw ,  but not at random ,  stakes shod with iron and heavy stones
 ubi sonus molientium aut adpositae scalae hostem in manus dederant , propellere umbone , pilo sequi multos in moenia egressos pugionibus fodere$$ Where the noise of the assailants was heard ,  or where the ladders placed against the walls brought the enemy within reach of their hands ,  they pushed them back with their shields ,  and followed them with their javelins
 sic exhausta nocte novam aciem dies aperuit$$ Many ,  who had struggled on to the walls ,  they stabbed with their short swords
 Eduxerant Batavi turrim duplici tabulato , quam praetoriae portae (is aequissimus locus) propinquantem promoti contra validi asseres et incussae trabes perfregere multa superstantium pernicie$$ The Batavians had raised a tower two stories high ,  which they brought up to the Praetorian gate of the camp ,  where the ground was most level But our men ,  pushing forward strong poles ,  and battering it with beams ,  broke it down ,  causing great destruction among the combatants on the top
 pugnatumque in perculsos subita et prospera eruptione$$ The enemy were attacked in their confusion by a sudden and successful sally
 simul a legionariis peritia et arte praestantibus plura struebantur$$ All this time many engines were constructed by the legionaries ,  who were superior to the enemy in experience and skill
 praecipuum pavorem intulit suspensum et nutans machinamentum , quo repente demisso praeter suorum ora singuli pluresve hostium sublime rapti verso pondere intra castra effundebantur$$ Peculiar consternation was caused by a machine ,  which ,  being poised in the air over the heads of the enemy ,  suddenly descended ,  and carried up one or more of them past the faces of their friends ,  and then ,  by a shifting of the weights ,  projected them within the limits of the camp
 Civilis omissa expugnandi spe rursus per otium adsidebat , nuntiis et promissis fidem legionum convellens$$ Civilis ,  giving up all hope of a successful assault ,  again sat down to blockade the camp at his leisure ,  and undermined the fidelity of the legions by the promises of his emissaries
 Haec in Germania ante Cremonense proelium gesta , cuius eventum litterae Primi Antonii docuere , addito Caecinae edicto$$ All these events in Germany took place before the battle of Cremona ,  the result of which was announced in a despatch from Antonius ,  accompanied by Caecina's proclamation
 et praefectus cohortis e victis , Alpinius Montanus , fortunam partium praesens fatebatur$$ Alpinius Montanus ,  prefect of a cohort in the vanquished army ,  was on the spot ,  and acknowledged the fate of his party
 diversi hinc motus animorum$$ Various were the emotions thus excited
 auxilia e Gallia , quis nec amor neque odium in partis , militia sine adfectu , hortantibus praefectis statim a Vitellio desciscunt$$ the Gallic auxiliaries ,  who felt neither affection nor hatred towards either party ,  and who served without attachment ,  at once ,  at the instance of their prefects ,  deserted Vitellius
 vetus miles cunctabatur$$ The veteran soldiers hesitated
 sed adigente Hordeonio Flacco , instantibus tribunis , dixit sacramentum , non vultu neque animo satis adfirmans et cum cetera iuris iurandi verba conciperent , Vespasiani nomen haesitantes aut levi murmure et plerumque silentio transmittebant$$ Nevertheless ,  when Hordeonius administered the oath ,  under a strong pressure from their tribunes ,  they pronounced the words ,  which their looks and their temper belied ,  and while they adopted every other expression ,  they hesitated at the name of Vespasian ,  passing it over with a slight murmur ,  and not unfrequently in absolute silence
 Lectae deinde pro contione epistulae Antonii ad Civilem suspiciones militum inritavere , tamquam ad socium partium scriptae et de Germanico exercitu hostiliter$$ After this ,  certain letters from Antonius to Civilis were read in full assembly ,  and provoked the suspicions of the soldiery ,  as they seemed to be addressed to a partisan of the cause and to be unfriendly to the army of Germany
 mox adlatis Geldubam in castra nuntiis eadem dicta factaque , et missus cum mandatis Montanus ad Civilem ut absisteret bello neve externa armis falsis velaret si Vespasianum iuvare adgressus foret , satis factum coeptis$$ Soon the news reached the camp at Gelduba ,  and the same language and the same acts were repeated Montanus was sent with a message to Civilis ,  bidding him desist from hostilities ,  and not seek to conceal the designs of an enemy by fighting under false colours ,  and telling him that ,  if he had been attempting to assist Vespasian ,  his purpose had been fully accomplished
 ad ea Civilis primo callide post ubi videt Montanum praeferocem ingenio paratumque in res novas , orsus a questu periculisque quae per quinque et viginti annos in castris Romanis exhausisset , egregium inquit pretium laborum recepi , necem fratris et vincula mea et saevissimas huius exercitus voces , quibus ad supplicium petitus iure gentium poenas reposco$$ Civilis at first replied in artful language ,  but soon perceiving that Montanus was a man of singularly high spirit and was himself disposed for change ,  he began with lamenting the perils through which he had struggled for five-and-twenty years in the camps of Rome It is ,  he said ,  a noble reward that I have received for my toils my brother murdered ,  myself imprisoned ,  and the savage clamour of this army ,  a clamour which demanded my execution ,  and for which by the law of nations I demand vengeance
 vos autem Treviri ceteraeque servientium animae , quod praemium effusi totiens sanguinis expectatis nisi ingratam militiam , immortalia tributa , virgas , securis et dominorum ingenia$$ You ,  Treveri ,  and other enslaved creatures ,  what reward do you expect for the blood which you have shed so often What but a hateful service ,  perpetual tribute ,  the rod ,  the axe ,  and the passions of a ruling race
 en ego praefectus unius cohortis et Canninefates Batavique , exigua Galliarum portio , vana illa castrorum spatia excidimus vel saepta ferro fameque premimus$$ See how I ,  the prefect of a single cohort ,  with the Batavians and the Canninefates ,  a mere fraction of Gaul ,  have destroyed their vast but useless camps ,  or are pressing them with the close blockade of famine and the sword
 denique ausos aut libertas sequetur aut victi idem erimus$$ In a word ,  either freedom will follow on our efforts ,  or ,  if we are vanquished ,  we shall but be what we were before
 sic accensum , sed molliora referre iussum dimittit$$ Having thus fired the man's ambition ,  Civilis dismissed him ,  but bade him carry back a milder answer
 ille ut inritus legationis redit , cetera dissimulans , quae mox erupere$$ He returned ,  pretending to have failed in his mission ,  but not revealing the other facts
 Civilis parte copiarum retenta veteranas cohortis et quod e Germanis maxime promptum adversus Voculam exercitumque eius mittit , Iulio Maximo et Claudio Victore , sororis suae filio , ducibus$$ Civilis ,  retaining a part of his forces ,  sent the veteran cohorts and the bravest of his German troops against Vocula and his army ,  under the command of Julius Maximus and Claudius Victor ,  his sister's son
 rapiunt in transitu hiberna alae Asciburgii sita adeoque improvisi castra involavere ut non adloqui , non pandere aciem Vocula potuerit$$ On their march they plundered the winter camp of a body of horse stationed at Ascibergium ,  and they fell on Vocula's camp so unexpectedly that he could neither harangue his army ,  nor even get it into line
 id solum ut in tumultu monuit , subsignano milite media firmare$$ All that he could do in the confusion was to order the veteran troops to strengthen the centre
 auxilia passim circumfusa sunt$$ The auxiliaries were dispersed in every part of the field
 eques prorupit , exceptusque compositis hostium ordinibus terga in suos vertit$$ The cavalry charged ,  but ,  received by the orderly array of the enemy ,  fled to their own lines
 caedes inde , non proelium$$ What ensued was a massacre rather than a battle
 et Nerviorum cohortes , metu seu perfidia , latera nostrorum nudavere$$ The Nervian infantry ,  from panic or from treachery ,  exposed the flank of our army
 sic ad legiones perventum , quae amissis signis intra vallum sternebantur , cum repente novo auxilio fortuna pugnae mutatur$$ Thus the attack fell upon the legions ,  who had lost their standards and were being cut down within the entrenchments ,  when the fortune of the day was suddenly changed by a reinforcement of fresh troops
 Vasconum lectae a Galba cohortes ac tum accitae , dum castris propinquant , audito proeliantium clamore intentos hostis a tergo invadunt latioremque quam pro numero terrorem faciunt , aliis a Novaesio , aliis a Mogontiaco universas copias advenisse credentibus$$ Some Vascon infantry ,  levied by Galba ,  which had by this time been sent for ,  heard the noise of the combatants as they approached the camp ,  attacked the rear of the preoccupied enemy ,  and spread a panic more than proportionate to their numbers ,  some believing that all the troops from Novesium ,  others that all from Mogontiacum ,  had come up
 is error Romanis addit animos , et dum alienis viribus confidunt , suas recepere$$ This delusion restored the courage of the Romans ,  and in relying on the strength of others they recovered their own
 fortissimus quisque e Batavis , quantum peditum erat , funduntur eques evasit cum signis captivisque , quos prima acie corripuerant$$ All the bravest of the Batavians ,  of the infantry at least ,  fell ,  but the cavalry escaped with the standards and with the prisoners whom they had secured in the early part of the engagement
 caesorum eo die in partibus nostris maior numerus et imbellior , e Germanis ipsa robora$$ Of the slain on that day the greater number belonged to our army ,  but to its less effective part
 Dux uterque pari culpa meritus adversa prosperis defuere$$ The two generals were equally blameworthy
 nam Civilis si maioribus copiis instruxisset aciem , circumiri a tam paucis cohortibus nequisset castraque perrupta excidisset$$ they deserved defeat ,  they did not make the most of success
 Vocula nec adventum hostium exploravit , eoque simul egressus victusque$$ Had Civilis given battle in greater force ,  he could not have been outflanked by so small a number of cohorts ,  and he might have destroyed the camp after once forcing an entrance
 dein victoriae parum confisus , tritis frustra diebus castra in hostem movit , quem si statim impellere cursumque rerum sequi maturasset , solvere obsidium legionum eodem impetu potuit$$ As for Vocula ,  he did not reconnoitre the advancing enemy ,  and consequently he was vanquished as soon as be left the camp and then ,  mistrusting his victory ,  he fruitlessly wasted several days before marching against the enemy ,  though ,  had he at once resolved to drive them back ,  and to follow up his success ,  he might ,  by one and the same movement ,  have raised the siege of the legions
 temptaverat interim Civilis obsessorum animos , tamquam perditae apud Romanos res et suis victoria provenisset$$ Meanwhile Civilis had tried to work on the feelings of the besieged by representing that with the Romans all was lost ,  and that victory had declared for his own troops
 circumferebantur signa vexillaque , ostentati etiam captivi$$ The standards and colours were carried round the ramparts ,  and the prisoners also were displayed
 ex quibus unus , egregium facinus ausus , clara voce gesta patefecit , confossus illico a Germanis$$ One of them ,  with noble daring ,  declared the real truth in a loud voice ,  and ,  as he was cut down on the spot by the Germans ,  all the more confidence was felt in his information
 unde maior indici fides$$ At the same time it was becoming evident ,  from the devastation of the country and from the flames of burning houses ,  that the victorious army was approaching
 simul vastatione incendiisque flagrantium villarum venire victorem exercitum intellegebatur$$ Vocula issued orders that the standards should be planted within sight of the camp ,  and should be surrounded with a ditch and rampart ,  where his men might deposit their knapsacks ,  and so fight without encumbrance
 in conspectu castrorum constitui signa fossamque et vallum circumdari Vocula iubet$$ On this ,  the General was assailed by a clamorous demand for instant battle
 depositis impedimentis sarcinisque expediti certarent$$ They had now grown used to threaten
 hinc in ducem clamor pugnam poscentium$$ Without even taking time to form into line ,  disordered and weary as they were ,  they commenced the action
 et minari adsueverant$$ Civilis was on the field ,  trusting quite as much to the faults of his adversaries as to the valour of his own troops
 ne tempore quidem ad ordinandam aciem capto incompositi fessique proelium sumpsere$$ With the Romans the fortune of the day varied ,  and the most violently mutinous shewed themselves cowards
 nam Civilis aderat , non minus vitiis hostium quam virtute suorum fretus$$ But some ,  remembering their recent victory ,  stood their ground and struck fiercely at the foe ,  now encouraging each other and their neighbours ,  and now ,  while they re-formed their lines ,  imploring the besieged not to lose the opportunity
 varia apud Romanos fortuna et seditiosissimus quisque ignavus$$ These latter ,  who saw everything from the walls ,  sallied out from every gate
 quidam recentis victoriae memores retinere locum , ferire hostem , seque et proximos hortari et redintegrata acie manus ad obsessos tendere ne tempori deessent$$ It so happened that Civilis was thrown to the ground by the fall of his horse A report that he had been either wounded or slain gained belief throughout both armies ,  and spread incredible panic among his own troops ,  and gave as great encouragement to their opponents
 illi cuncta e muris cernentes omnibus portis prorumpunt$$ But Vocula ,  leaving the flying foe ,  began to strengthen the rampart and the towers of the camp ,  as if another siege were imminent
 ac forte Civilis lapsu equi prostratus , credita per utrumque exercitum fama vulneratum aut interfectum , immane quantum suis pavoris et hostibus alacritatis indidit$$ He had misused success so often that he was rightly suspected of a preference for war
 Nihil aeque exercitus nostros quam egestas copiarum fatigabat$$ Nothing distressed our troops so much as the scarcity of supplies
 impedimenta legionum cum imbelli turba Novaesium missa ut inde terrestri itinere frumentum adveherent$$ The baggage of the legions was therefore sent to Novesium with a crowd of non-combatants to fetch corn from that place overland ,  for the enemy commanded the river
 nam flumine hostes potiebantur$$ The march of the first body was accomplished in security ,  as Civilis had not yet recovered
 primum agmen securum incessit , nondum satis firmo Civile qui ubi rursum missos Novaesium frumentatores datasque in praesidium cohortis velut multa pace ingredi accepit , rarum apud signa militem , arma in vehiculis , cunctos licentia vagos , compositus invadit , praemissis qui pontis et viarum angusta insiderent$$ But when he heard that officers of the commissariat had been again sent to Novesium ,  and that the infantry detached as an escort were advancing just as if it were a time of profound peace ,  with but few soldiers round the standards ,  the arms stowed away in the wagons ,  and all wandering about at their pleasure ,  he attacked them in regular form ,  having first sent on troops to occupy the bridges and the defiles in the road
 pugnatum longo agmine et incerto Marte , donec proelium nox dirimeret$$ The battle extended over a long line of march ,  lasting with varying success till night parted the combatants
 cohortes Geldubam perrexere , manentibus , ut fuerant , castris , quae relictorum illic militum praesidio tenebantur$$ The infantry pushed on to Gelduba ,  while the camp remained in the same state as before ,  garrisoned by such troops as had been left in it
 non erat dubium quantum in regressu discriminis adeundum foret frumentatoribus onustis perculsisque$$ There could be no doubt what peril a convoy ,  heavily laden and panic-stricken ,  would have to encounter in attempting to return
 addit exercitui suo Vocula mille delectos e quinta et quinta decima legionibus apud Vetera obsessis , indomitum militem et ducibus infensum$$ Vocula added to his force a thousand picked men from the fifth and fifteenth legions besieged in the Old Camp ,  a body of troops undisciplined and ill-affected to their officers
 plures quam iussum erat profecti palam in agmine fremebant , non se ultra famem , insidias legatorum toleraturos$$ But more than the number specified came forward ,  and openly protested ,  as they marched ,  that they would not endure any longer the hardships of famine and the treachery of the legates
 at qui remanserant , desertos se abducta parte legionum querebantur$$ On the other hand ,  those who had stayed behind complained that they were ,  being left to their fate by this withdrawal of a part of the legions
 duplex hinc seditio , aliis revocantibus Voculam , aliis redire in castra abnuentibus$$ A twofold mutiny was the result ,  some calling upon Vocula to come back ,  while the others refused to return to the camp
 Interim Civilis Vetera circumsedit$$ Meanwhile Civilis blockaded the Old Camp
 Vocula Geldubam atque inde Novaesium concessit , Civilis capit Geldubam mox haud procul Novaesio equestri proelio prospere certavit$$ Vocula retired first to Gelduba ,  after ,  wards to Novesium Civilis took possession of Gelduba ,  and not long after was victorious in a cavalry engagement near Novesium
 sed miles secundis adversisque perinde in exitium ducum accendebatur$$ But reverses and successes seemed equally to kindle in the troops the one desire of murdering their officers
 et adventu quintanorum quintadecimanorumque auctae legiones donativum exposcunt , comperto pecuniam a Vitellio missam$$ The legions ,  increased in number by the arrival of the men from the fifth and fifteenth ,  demanded a donative ,  for they had discovered that some money had been sent by Vitellius
 nec diu cunctatus Hordeonius nomine Vespasiani dedit , idque praecipuum fuit seditionis alimentum$$ After a short delay Hordeonius gave the donative in the name of Vespasian This ,  more than anything else ,  fostered the mutinous spirit
 effusi in luxum et epulas et nocturnos coetus veterem in Hordeonium iram renovant , nec ullo legatorum tribunorumve obsistere auso (quippe omnem pudorem nox ademerat) protractum e cubili interficiunt$$ The men ,  abandoning themselves to debauchery and revelry and all the license of nightly gatherings ,  revived their old grudge against Hordeonius Without a single legate or tribune venturing to check them ,  for the darkness seems to have taken from them all sense of shame ,  they dragged him out of his bed and killed him
 eadem in Voculam parabantur , nisi servili habitu per tenebras ignoratus evasisset$$ The same fate was intended for Vocula ,  but he assumed the dress of a slave ,  and escaped unrecognized in the darkness
 Vbi sedato impetu metus rediit , centuriones cum epistulis ad civitates Galliarum misere , auxilia ac stipendia oraturos ipsi , ut est vulgus sine rectore praeceps pavidum socors , adventante Civile raptis temere armis ac statim omissis , in fugam vertuntur$$ These men ,  headstrong ,  cowardly ,  and spiritless ,  as a mob without a leader always is ,  on the approach of Civilis hastily took up arms ,  and ,  as hastily abandoning them ,  betook themselves to flight Disaster produced disunion ,  the troops from the Upper army dissociating their cause from that of their comrades
 res adversae discordiam peperere , iis qui e superiore exercitu erant causam suam dissociantibus$$ Nevertheless the statues of Vitellius were again set up in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgian towns ,  and this at a time when Vitellius himself had fallen
 Vitellii tamen imagines in castris et per proximas Belgarum civitates repositae , cum iam Vitellius occidisset dein mutati in paenitentiam primani quartanique et duoetvicensimani Voculam sequuntur , apud quem resumpto Vespasiani sacramento ad liberandum Mogontiaci obsidium ducebantur$$ Then the men of the 1st ,  the 4th ,  and the 18th legions ,  repenting of their conduct ,  followed Vocula ,  and again taking in his presence the oath of allegiance to Vespasian ,  were marched by him to the relief of Mogontiacum The besieging army ,  an heterogeneous mass of Chatti ,  Usipii ,  and Mattiaci ,  had raised the siege ,  glutted with spoils ,  but not without suffering loss
 discesserant obsessores , mixtus ex Chattis Vsipis Mattiacis exercitus , satietate praedae nec incruenti in via dispersos et nescios miles noster invaserat quin et loricam vallumque per finis suos Treviri struxere , magnisque in vicem cladibus cum Germanis certabant , donec egregia erga populum Romanum merita mox rebelles foedarent$$ Our troops attacked them on the way ,  dispersed and unprepared Moreover the Treveri had constructed a breastwork and rampart across their territory ,  and they and the Germans continued to contend with great losses on both sides up to the time when they tarnished by rebellion their distinguished services to the Roman people
 Interea Vespasianus iterum ac Titus consulatum absentes inierunt , maesta et multiplici metu suspensa civitate , quae super instantia mala falsos pavores induerat , descivisse Africam res novas moliente Lucius Pisone$$ Meanwhile Vespasian (now consul for the second time) and Titus entered upon their office ,  both being absent from Rome People were gloomy and anxious under the pressure of manifold fears ,  for ,  over and above immediate perils ,  they had taken groundless alarm under the impression that Africa was in rebellion through the revolutionary movements of Lucius Piso
 is <pro consule> provinciae nequaquam turbidus ingenio$$ He was governor of that province ,  and was far from being a man of turbulent disposition
 sed quia naves saevitia hiemis prohibebantur , vulgus alimenta in dies mercari solitum , cui una ex re publica annonae cura , clausum litus , retineri commeatus , dum timet , credebat , augentibus famam Vitellianis , qui studium partium nondum posuerant , ne victoribus quidem ingrato rumore , quorum cupiditates externis quoque bellis inexplebilis nulla umquam civilis victoria satiavit$$ The fact was that the wheat-ships were detained by the severity of the weather ,  and the lower orders ,  who were accustomed to buy their provisions from day to day ,  and to whom cheap corn was the sole subject of public interest ,  feared and believed that the ports had been closed and the supplies stopped ,  the Vitellianists ,  who had not yet given up their party feelings ,  helping to spread the report ,  which was not displeasing even to the conquerors Their ambition ,  which even foreign campaigns could not fill to the full ,  was not satisfied by any triumphs that civil war could furnish
 Kalendis Ianuariis in senatu , quem Iulius Frontinus praetor urbanus vocaverat , legatis exercitibusque ac regibus laudes gratesque decretae$$ On the 1st of January ,  at a meeting of the Senate ,  convoked for the purpose by Julius Frontinus ,  praetor of the city ,  votes of thanks were passed to the legates ,  to the armies ,  and to the allied kings
 Tettio Iuliano praetura , tamquam transgredientem in partis Vespasiani legionem deseruisset , ablata ut in Plotium Grypum transferretur$$ The office of praetor was taken away from Tettius Julianus ,  as having deserted his legion when it passed over to the party of Vespasian ,  with a view to its being transferred to Plotius Griphus
 Hormo dignitas equestris data$$ Equestrian rank was conferred on Hormus
 et mox eiurante Frontino Caesar Domitianus praeturam cepit$$ Then ,  on the resignation of Frontinus ,  Caesar Domitian assumed the office of praetor of the city
 eius nomen epistulis edictisque praeponebatur , vis penes Mucianum erat , nisi quod pleraque Domitianus instigantibus amicis aut propria libidine audebat$$ His name was put at the head of despatches and edicts ,  but the real authority was in the hands of Mucianus ,  with this exception ,  that Domitian ventured on several acts of power ,  at the instigation of his friends ,  or at his own caprice
 sed praecipuus Muciano metus e Primo Antonio Varoque Arrio , quos recentis clarosque rerum fama ac militum studiis etiam populus fovebat , quia in neminem ultra aciem saevierant$$ But Mucianus found his principal cause of apprehension in Primus Antonius and Varus Arrius ,  who ,  in the freshness of their fame ,  while distinguished by great achievements and by the attachment of the soldiery ,  were also supported by the people ,  because in no case had they extended their severities beyond the battle-field
 et ferebatur Antonius Scribonianum Crassum , egregiis maioribus et fraterna imagine fulgentem , ad capessendam rem publicam hortatus , haud defutura consciorum manu , ni Scribonianus abnuisset , ne paratis quidem corrumpi facilis , adeo metuens incerta$$ It was also reported that Antonius had urged Scribonianus Crassus ,  whom an illustrious descent added to the honours of his brother made a conspicuous person ,  to assume the supreme power and it was understood that a number of accomplices would not have failed to support him ,  had not the proposal been rejected by Scribonianus ,  who was a man not easily to be tempted even by a certainty ,  and was proportionately apprehensive of risk
 igitur Mucianus , quia propalam opprimi Antonius nequibat , multis in senatu laudibus cumulatum secretis promissis onerat , citeriorem Hispaniam ostentans discessu Cluvii Rufi vacuam$$ Mucianus ,  seeing that Antonius could not be openly crushed ,  heaped many praises upon him in the Senate ,  and loaded him with promises in secret ,  holding out as a prize the government of Eastern Spain ,  then vacant in consequence of the departure of Cluvius Rufus
 simul amicis eius tribunatus praefecturasque largitur$$ At the same time he lavished on his friends tribuneships and prefectures
 dein postquam inanem animum spe et cupidine impleverat , viris abolet dimissa in hiberna legione septima , cuius flagrantissimus in Antonium amor$$ and then ,  when he had filled the vain heart of the man with hope and ambition ,  he destroyed his power by sending into winter quarters the 7th legion ,  whose affection for Antonius was particularly vehement
 et tertia legio , familiaris Arrio Varo miles , in Syriam remissa$$ The 3rd legion ,  old troops of Varus Arrius ,  were sent back to Syria
 pars exercitus in Germanias ducebatur$$ Part of the army was on its way to Germany
 sic egesto quidquid turbidum redit urbi sua forma legesque et munia magistratuum$$ Thus all elements of disturbance being removed ,  the usual appearance of the capital ,  the laws ,  and the jurisdiction of the magistrates ,  were once more restored
 Senatus inchoantibus primoribus ius iurandum concepit quo certatim omnes magistratus , ceteri , ut sententiam rogabantur , deos testis advocabant , nihil ope sua factum quo cuiusquam salus laederetur , neque se praemium aut honorem ex calamitate civium cepisse , trepidis et verba iuris iurandi per varias artis mutantibus , quis flagitii conscientia inerat$$ The Senate ,  led by its principal members ,  then framed a form of oath ,  which was eagerly taken by all the magistrates and by the other Senators in the order in which they voted They called the Gods to witness ,  that nothing had been done by their instrumentality to prejudice the safety of any person ,  and that they had gained no distinction or advantage by the ruin of Roman citizens Great was the alarm ,  and various the devices for altering the words of the oath ,  among those who felt the consciousness of guilt
 probabant religionem patres , periurium arguebant$$ The Senate appreciated the scruple ,  but denounced the perjury
 eaque velut censura in Sariolenum Voculam et Nonium Attianum et Cestium Severum acerrime incubuit , crebris apud Neronem delationibus famosos$$ This public censure ,  as it might be called ,  fell with especial severity on three men ,  Sariolenus Vocula ,  Nonnius Attianus ,  and Cestius Severus ,  all of them infamous for having practised the trade of the informer in the days of Nero
 Sariolenum et recens crimen urgebat , quod apud Vitellium molitus eadem foret$$ Sariolenus indeed laboured under an imputation of recent date
 nec destitit senatus manus intentare Voculae , donec curia excederet$$ It was said that he had attempted the same practices during the reign of Vitellius
 ad Paccium Africanum transgressi eum quoque proturbant , tamquam Neroni Scribonios fratres concordia opibusque insignis ad exitium monstravisset$$ The Senators did not desist from threatening gestures ,  till he quitted the chamber then passing to Paccius Africanus ,  they assailed him in the same way
 Africanus neque fateri audebat neque abnuere poterat$$ It was he ,  they said ,  who had singled out as victims for Nero the brothers Scribonius ,  renowned for their mutual affection and for their wealth
 in Vibium Crispum , cuius interrogationibus fatigabatur , ultro conversus , miscendo quae defendere nequibat , societate culpae invidiam declinavit$$ Africanus dared not confess his guilt ,  and could not deny it but he himself turned on Vibius Crispus ,  who was pressing him with questions ,  and complicating a charge which he could not rebut ,  shifted the blame from himself by associating another with his guilt
 Magnam eo die pietatis eloquentiaeque famam Vipstanus Messala adeptus est , nondum senatoria aetate , ausus pro fratre Aquilio Regulo deprecari$$ Great was the reputation for brotherly affection ,  as well as for eloquence ,  which Vipstanus Messalla earned for himself on that day ,  by venturing ,  though not yet of Senatorial age ,  to plead for his brother Aquilius Regulus
 Regulum subversa Crassorum et Orfiti domus in summum odium extulerat$$ The fall of the families of the Crassi and Orfitus had brought Regulus into the utmost odium
 sponte ex sc accusationem subisse iuvenis admodum , nec depellendi periculi sed in spem potentiae videbatur$$ Of his own free will ,  as it seemed ,  and while still a mere youth ,  he had undertaken the prosecution ,  not to ward off any peril from himself ,  but in the hope of gaining power
 et Sulpicia Praetextata Crassi uxor quattuorque liberi , si cognosceret senatus , ultores aderant$$ The wife of Crassus ,  Sulpicia Praetextata ,  and her four children were ready ,  should the Senate take cognizance of the cause ,  to demand vengeance
 igitur Messala non causam neque reum tueri , sed periculis fratris semet opponens flexerat quosdam$$ Accordingly ,  Messalla ,  without attempting to defend the case or the person accused ,  had simply thrown himself in the way of the perils that threatened his brother ,  and had thus wrought upon the feelings of several Senators
 occurrit truci oratione Curtius Montanus , eo usque progressus ut post caedem Galbae datam interfectori Pisonis pecuniam a Regulo adpetitumque morsu Pisonis caput obiectaret$$ On this Curtius Montanus met him with a fierce speech ,  in which he went to the length of asserting ,  that after the death of Galba ,  money had been given by Regulus to the murderer of Piso ,  and that he had even fastened his teeth in the murdered man's head
 hoc certe inquit Nero non coegit , nec dignitatem aut salutem illa saevitia redemisti$$ Certainly ,  he said ,  Nero did not compel this act
 sane toleremus istorum defensiones qui perdere alios quam periclitari ipsi maluerunt$$ you did not secure by this piece of barbarity either your rank or your life
 te securum reliquerat exul pater et divisa inter creditores bona , nondum honorum capax aetas , nihil quod ex te concupisceret Nero , nihil quod timeret$$ We may bear with the defence put forward by men who thought it better to destroy others than to come into peril themselves
 libidine sanguinis et hiatu praemiorum ignotum adhuc ingenium et nullis defensionibus expertum caede nobili imbuisti , cum ex funere rei publicae raptis consularibus spoliis , septuagiens sestertio saginatus et sacerdotio fulgens innoxios pueros , inlustris senes , conspicuas feminas eadem ruina prosterneres , cum segnitiam Neronis incusares , quod per singulas domos seque et delatores fatigaret posse universum senatum una voce subverti retinete , patres conscripti , et reservate hominem tam expediti consilii ut omnis aetas instructa sit , et quo modo senes nostri Marcellum , Crispum , iuvenes Regulum imitentur$$ As for you ,  the exile of your father ,  and the division of his property among his creditors ,  had left you perfectly safe ,  besides that your youth incapacitated you for office there was nothing in you which Nero could either covet or dread It was from sheer lust of slaughter and greed of gain that you ,  unknown as you were ,  you ,  who had never pleaded in any man's defence ,  steeped your soul in noble blood ,  when ,  though you had snatched from the very grave of your Country the spoils of a man of consular rank ,  had been fed to the full with seven million sesterces ,  and shone with all sacerdotal honours ,  you yet overwhelmed in one common ruin innocent boys ,  old men of illustrious name ,  and noble ladies ,  when you actually blamed the tardy movements of Nero in wearying himself and his informers with the overthrow of single families ,  and declared that the whole Senate might be destroyed by one word
 invenit aemulos etiam infelix nequitia$$ Keep ,  Conscript Fathers ,  preserve a man of such ready counsels ,  that every age may be furnished with its teacher ,  and that our young men may imitate Regulus ,  just as our old men imitate Marcellus and Crispus
 quid si floreat vigeatque$$ Even unsuccessful villany finds some to emulate it 
 et quem adhuc quaestorium offendere non audemus , praetorium et consularem ausuri sumus$$  what will happen ,  if it flourish and be strong
 an Neronem extremum dominorum putatis$$ And the man ,  whom we dare not offend when he holds only quaestor's rank ,  are we to see him rise to the dignities of praetor and consul
 idem crediderant qui Tiberio , qui Gaio superstites fuerunt , cum interim intestabilior et saevior exortus est$$ Do you suppose that Nero will be the last of the tyrants
 non timemus Vespasianum$$ Those who survived Tiberius ,  those who survived Caligula ,  thought the same
 ea principis aetas , ea moderatio$$ and yet after each there arose another ruler yet more detestable and more cruel
 sed diutius durant exempla quam mores$$ We are not afraid of Vespasian
 elanguimus , patres conscripti , nec iam ille senatus sumus qui occiso Nerone delatores et ministros more maiorum puniendos flagitabat$$ the age and moderation of the new Emperor reassure us
 optimus est post malum principem dies primus$$ But the influence of an example outlives the individual character
 Tanto cum adsensu senatus auditus est Montanus ut spem caperet Helvidius posse etiam Marcellum prosterni$$ Montanus was heard with such approval on the part of the Senate ,  that Helvidius conceived a hope that Marcellus also might be overthrown
 igitur a laude Cluvii Rufi orsus , qui perinde dives et eloquentia clarus nulli umquam sub Nerone periculum facessisset , crimine simul exemploque Eprium urgebat , ardentibus patrum animis$$ He therefore began with a panegyric on Cluvius Rufus ,  who ,  though not less rich nor less renowned for eloquence ,  had never imperilled a single life in the days of Nero By this comparison ,  as well as by direct accusations ,  he pressed Eprius hard ,  and stirred the indignation of the Senators
 quod ubi sensit Marcellus , velut excedens curia imus inquit , Prisce , et relinquimus tibi senatum tuum$$ When Marcellus perceived this ,  he made as if he would leave the House ,  exclaiming ,  We go ,  Priscus ,  and leave you your Senate
 regna praesente Caesare$$ act the king ,  though Caesar himself be present
 sequebatur Vibius Crispus , ambo infensi , vultu diverso , Marcellus minacibus oculis , Crispus renidens , donec adcursu amicorum retraherentur$$ Crispus followed Both were enraged ,  but their looks were different Marcellus cast furious glances about him ,  while Crispus smiled They were drawn back ,  however ,  into the Senate by the hasty interference of friends
 cum glisceret certamen , hinc multi bonique , inde pauci et validi pertinacibus odiis tenderent , consumptus per discordiam dies$$ The contest grew fiercer ,  while the well-disposed majority on the one side ,  and a powerful minority on the other ,  fought out their obstinate quarrel ,  and thus the day was spent in altercation
 Proximo senatu , inchoante Caesare de abolendo dolore iraque et priorum temporum necessitatibus , censuit Mucianus prolixe pro accusatoribus$$ At the next meeting of the Senate Caesar began by recommending that the wrongs ,  the resentments ,  and the terrible necessities of former times ,  should be forgotten ,  and Mucianus spoke at great length in favour of the informers
 simul eos qui coeptam , deinde omissam actionem repeterent , monuit sermone molli et tamquam rogaret$$ At the same time he admonished in gentle terms and in a tone of entreaty those who were reviving indictments ,  which they had before commenced and afterwards dropped
 patres coeptatam libertatem , postquam obviam itum , omisere$$ The Senators ,  when they found themselves opposed ,  relinquished the liberty which they had begun to exercise
 Mucianus , ne sperni senatus iudicium et cunctis sub Nerone admissis data impunitas videretur , Octavium Sagittam et Antistium Sosianum senatorii ordinis egressos exilium in easdem insulas redegit$$ That it might not be thought that the opinion of the Senate was disregarded ,  or that impunity was accorded to all acts done in the days of Nero ,  Mucianus sent back to their islands two men of Senatorial rank ,  Octavius Sagitta and Antistius Sosianus ,  who had quitted their places of banishment
 Octavius Pontiam Postuminam , stupro cognitam et nuptias suas abnuentem , impotens amoris interfecerat , Sosianus pravitate morum multis exitiosus$$ Octavius had seduced one Pontia Postumia ,  and ,  on her refusing to marry him ,  in the frenzy of passion had murdered her Sosianus by his depravity had brought many to ruin
 ambo gravi senatus consulto damnati pulsique , quamvis concesso aliis reditu , in eadem poena retenti sunt$$ Both had been condemned and banished by a solemn decision of the Senate ,  and ,  though others were permitted to return ,  were kept under the same penalty
 nec ideo lenita erga Mucianum invidia$$ But this did not mitigate the hatred felt against Mucianus
 quippe Sosianus ac Sagitta viles , etiam si reverterentur$$ Sosianus and Sagitta were utterly insignificant ,  even if they did return
 accusatorum ingenia et opes et exercita malis artibus potentia timebantur$$ but men dreaded the abilities of the informers ,  their wealth ,  and the power which they exercised in many sinister ways
 Inter quae militaris seditio prope exarsit$$ Amidst all this a mutiny in the army all but broke out
 praetorianam militiam repetebant a Vitellio dimissi , pro Vespasiano congregati$$ The troops who ,  having been disbanded by Vitellius ,  had flocked to support Vespasian ,  asked leave to serve again in the Praetorian Guard ,  and the soldiers who had been selected from the legions with the same prospect now clamoured for their promised pay
 et lectus in eandem spem e legionibus miles promissa stipendia flagitabat$$ Even the Vitellianists could not be got rid of without much bloodshed
 ne Vitelliani quidem sine multa caede pelli poterant$$ But the money required for retaining in the service so vast a body of men was immensely large
 sed immensa pecunia tanta vis hominum retinenda erat$$ Mucianus entered the camp to examine more accurately the individual claims
 ingressus castra Mucianus , quo rectius stipendia singulorum spectaret , suis cum insignibus armisque victores constituit , modicis inter se spatiis discretos$$ The victorious army ,  wearing their proper decorations and arms ,  he drew up with moderate intervals of space between the divisions
 tum Vitelliani , quos apud Bovillas in deditionem acceptos memoravimus , ceterique per urbem et urbi vicina conquisiti producuntur prope intecto corpore$$ then the Vitellianists ,  whose capitulation at Bovillae I have already related ,  and the other troops of the party ,  who had been collected from the capital and its neighbourhood ,  were brought forth almost naked
 eos Mucianus diduci et Germanicum Britannicumque militem , ac si qui aliorum exercituum , separatim adsistere iubet$$ Mucianus ordered these men to be drawn up apart ,  making the British ,  the German ,  and any other troops that there were belonging to other armies ,  take up separate positions
 illos primus statim aspectus obstupefecerat , cum ex diverso velut aciem telis et armis trucem , semet clausos nudosque et inluvie deformis aspicerent$$ The very first view of their situation paralyzed them They saw opposed to them what seemed a hostile array ,  threatening them with javelin and sword
 ut vero huc illuc distrahi coepere , metus per omnis et praecipua Germanici militis formido , tamquam ea separatione ad caedem destinaretur$$ They saw themselves hemmed in ,  without arms ,  filthy and squalid And when they began to be separated ,  some to be marched to one spot ,  and some to another ,  a thrill of terror ran through them all
 prensare commanipularium pectora , cervicibus innecti , suprema oscula petere , ne desererentur soli neu pari causa disparem fortunam paterentur$$ Among the troops from Germany the panic was particularly great for they believed that this separation marked them out for slaughter
 modo Mucianum , modo absentem principem , postremum caelum ac deos obtestari , donec Mucianus cunctos eiusdem sacramenti , eiusdem imperatoris milites appellans , falso timori obviam iret$$ They embraced their fellow soldiers ,  clung to their necks ,  begged for parting kisses ,  and entreated that they might not be deserted ,  or doomed in a common cause to suffer a different lot
 namque et victor exercitus clamore lacrimas eorum iuvabat isque finis illa die$$ They invoked now Mucianus ,  now the absent Emperor ,  and ,  as a last resource ,  heaven and the Gods ,  till Mucianus came forward ,  and calling them soldiers bound by the same oath and servants of the same Emperor ,  stopped the groundless panic
 paucis post diebus adloquentem Domitianum firmati iam excepere$$ And indeed the victorious army seconded the tears of the vanquished with their approving shouts
 spernunt oblatos agros , militiam et stipendia orant$$ This terminated the proceedings for that day
 preces erant , sed quibus contra dici non posset$$ But when Domitian harangued them a few days afterwards ,  they received him with increased confidence
 igitur in praetorium accepti$$ The land that was offered them they contemptuously rejected ,  and begged for regular service and pay
 dein quibus aetas et iusta stipendia , dimissi cum honore , alii ob culpam , sed carptim ac singuli , quo tutissimo remedio consensus multitudinis extenuatur$$ Theirs were prayers indeed ,  but such as it was impossible to reject They were therefore received into the Praetorian camp
 Ceterum verane pauperie an uti videretur , actum in senatu ut sescentiens sestertium a privatis mutuum acciperetur , praepositusque ei curae Pompeius Silvanus$$ It is a fact that ,  whether suggested by real poverty or by a wish to give the appearance of it ,  a proposition passed the Senate to the effect that a loan of sixty million sesterces from private persons should be accepted
 nec multo post necessitas abiit sive omissa simulatio abrogati inde legem ferente Domitiano consulatus quos Vitellius dederat , funusque censorium Flavio Sabino ductum , magna documenta instabilis fortunae summaque et ima miscentis$$ Pompeius Silvanus was appointed to manage the affair Before long ,  either the necessity ceased or the pretence was dropped After this ,  on the motion of Domitian ,  the consulships conferred by Vitellius were cancelled ,  and the honours of a censor's funeral were paid to Sabinus great lessons both of the mutability of fortune ,  ever bringing together the highest honours and the lowest humiliations
 Sub idem tempus Lucius Piso pro consule interficitur$$ About the same time the proconsul Lucius Piso was murdered
 ea de caede quam verissime expediam , si pauca supra repetiero ab initio causisque talium facinorum non absurda$$ I shall make the account of this murder as exact as possible by first reviewing a few earlier circumstances ,  which have a bearing on the origin and motives of such deeds
 legio in Africa auxiliaque tutandis imperii finibus sub divo Augusto Tiberioque principibus proconsuli parebant$$ The legion and the auxiliaries stationed in Africa to guard the frontiers of the Empire were under the proconsul's authority during the reigns of the divine Augustus and Tiberius
 mox G Caesar , turbidus animi ac Marcum Silanum obtinentem Africam metuens , ablatam proconsuli legionem misso in eam rem legato tradidit$$ But in course of time Caligula ,  prompted by his restless temper and by his fear of Marcus Silanus ,  who then held Africa ,  took away the legion from the proconsul ,  and handed it over to a legate whom he sent for that purpose
 aequatus inter duos beneficiorum numerus , et mixtis utriusque mandatis discordia quaesita auctaque pravo certamine$$ The patronage was equally divided between the two officers A source of disagreement was thus studiously sought in the continual clashing of their authority ,  and it was further developed by an unprincipled rivalry
 legatorum ius adolevit diuturnitate officii , vel quia minoribus maior aemulandi cura , proconsulum splendidissimus quisque securitati magis quam potentiae consulebant$$ The power of the legates grew through their lengthened tenure of office ,  and ,  perhaps ,  because an inferior feels greater interest in such a competition All the more distinguished of the proconsuls cared more for security than for power
 Sed tum legionem in Africa regebat Valerius Festus , sumptuosae adulescentiae neque modica cupiens et adfinitate Vitellii anxius$$ At this time the legion in Africa was commanded by Valerius Festus ,  a young man of extravagant habits and immoderate ambition ,  who was now made uneasy by his relationship to Vitellius
 is crebris sermonibus temptaveritne Pisonem ad res novas an temptanti restiterit , incertum , quoniam secreto eorum nemo adfuit , et occiso Pisone plerique ad gratiam interfectoris inclinavere$$ Whether this man in their frequent interviews tempted Piso to revolt ,  or whether he resisted such overtures ,  is not known for certain ,  for no one was present at their confidential meetings ,  and ,  after Piso's death ,  many were disposed to ingratiate themselves with the murderer
 nec ambigitur provinciam et militem alienato erga Vespasianum animo fuisse et quidam e Vitellianis urbe profugi ostentabant Pisoni nutantis Gallias , paratam Germaniam , pericula ipsius et in pace suspecto tutius bellum$$ There is no doubt that the province and the troops entertained feelings of hostility to Vespasian ,  and some of the Vitellianists ,  who had escaped from the capital ,  incessantly represented to Piso that Gaul was hesitating and Germany ready to revolt ,  that his own position was perilous ,  and that for one who in peace must be suspected ,  war was the safer course
 inter quae Claudius Sagitta , praefectus alae Petrianae , prospera navigatione praevenit Papirium centurionem a Muciano missum , adseveravitque mandata interficiendi Pisonis centurioni data$$ While this was going on ,  Claudius Sagitta ,  prefect of Petra's Horse ,  making a very quick passage ,  reached Africa before Papirius ,  the centurion despatched by Mucianus
 cecidisse Galerianum consobrinum eius generumque$$ He declared that an order to put Piso to death had been given to the centurion ,  and that Galerianus ,  his cousin and son-in-law ,  had perished
 unam in audacia spem salutis , sed duo itinera audendi , seu mallet statim arma , seu petita navibus Gallia ducem se Vitellianis exercitibus ostenderet$$ that his only hope of safety was in bold action that in such action two paths were open he might defend himself on the spot ,  or he might sail for Gaul and offer his services as general to the Vitellianist armies
 nihil ad ea moto Pisone , centurio a Muciano missus , ut portum Carthaginis attigit , magna voce laeta Pisoni omnia tamquam principi continuare , obvios et subitae rei miraculo attonitos ut eadem adstreperent hortari$$ Piso was wholly unmoved by this statement The centurion despatched by Mucianus ,  on landing in the port of Carthage ,  raised his voice ,  and invoked in succession all blessings on the head of Piso ,  as if he were Emperor ,  and bade the bystanders ,  who were astonished by this sudden and strange proceeding ,  take up the same cry
 vulgus credulum ruere in forum , praesentiam Pisonis exposcere$$ The credulous mob rushed into the market-place ,  and demanded that Piso should shew himself
 gaudio clamoribusque cuncta miscebant , indiligentia veri et adulandi libidine$$ They threw everything into an uproar with their clamorous shouts of joy ,  careless of the truth ,  and only eager to flatter
 Piso indicio Sagittae vel insita modestia non in publicum egressus est neque se studiis vulgi permisit$$ Piso ,  acting on the information of Sagitta ,  or ,  perhaps ,  from natural modesty ,  would not make his appearance in public ,  or trust himself to the zeal of the populace
 centurionemque percontatus , postquam quaesitum sibi crimen caedemque comperit , animadverti in eum iussit , haud perinde spe vitae quam ira in percussorem , quod idem ex interfectoribus Clodii Macri cruentas legati sanguine manus ad caedem proconsulis rettulisset$$ On questioning the centurion ,  and finding that he had sought a pretext for accusing and murdering him ,  he ordered the man to be executed ,  moved ,  not so much by any hope of saving his life ,  as by indignation against the assassin for this fellow had been one of the murderers of Macer ,  and was now come to slay the proconsul with hands already stained with the blood of the legate
 anxio deinde edicto Carthaginiensibus increpitis , ne solita quidem munia usurpabat , clausus intra domum , ne qua motus novi causa vel forte oreretur$$ He then severely blamed the people of Carthage in an edict which betrayed his anxiety ,  and ceased to discharge even the usual duties of his office ,  shutting himself up in his palace ,  to guard against any casual occurrence that might lead to a new outbreak
 Sed ubi Festo consternatio vulgi , centurionis supplicium veraque et falsa more famae in maius innotuere , equites in necem Pisonis mittit$$ But when the agitation of the people ,  the execution of the centurion ,  and other news ,  true or false ,  exaggerated as usual by report ,  came to the ears of Festus ,  he sent some cavalry to put Piso to death
 illi raptim vecti obscuro adhuc coeptae lucis domum proconsulis inrumpunt destrictis gladiis , et magna pars Pisonis ignari , quod Poenos auxiliaris Maurosque in eam caedem delegerat$$ They rode over at full speed ,  and broke into the dwelling of the proconsul in the dim light of early dawn ,  with their swords drawn in their hands Many of them were unacquainted with the person of Piso ,  for the legate had selected some Moorish and Carthaginian auxiliaries to perpetrate the deed
 haud procul cubiculo obvium forte servum quisnam et ubi esset Piso interrogavere$$ Near the proconsul's chamber they chanced to meet a slave ,  and asked him who he was ,  and where Piso was to be found
 servus egregio mendacio se Pisonem esse respondit ac statim obtruncatur$$ The slave with a noble untruth replied ,  I am he ,  and was immediately cut down
 nec multo post Piso interficitur namque aderat qui nosceret , Baebius Massa e procuratoribus Africae , iam tunc optimo cuique exitiosus et inter causas malorum quae mox tulimus saepius rediturus$$ Soon after Piso was killed ,  for there was on the spot one who recognized him ,  Baebius Massa ,  one of the procurators of Africa ,  a name even then fatal to the good ,  and destined often to reappear among the causes of the sufferings which he had ere long to endure
 Festus Adrumeto , ubi speculabundus substiterat , ad legionem contendit praefectumque castrorum Caetronium Pisanum vinciri iussit proprias ob simultates , sed Pisonis satellitem vocabat militesque et centuriones quosdam puniit , alios praemiis adfecit , neutrum ex merito , sed ut oppressisse bellum crederetur$$ From Adrumetum ,  where he had stayed to watch the result ,  Festus went to the legion ,  and gave orders that Cetronius Pisanus ,  prefect of the camp ,  should be put in irons He did this out of private pique ,  but he called the man an accomplice of Piso Some few centurions and soldiers he punished ,  others he rewarded ,  neither the one nor the other deservedly ,  but he wished men to believe that he had extinguished a war
 mox Oeensium Lepcitanorumque discordias componit , quae raptu frugum et pecorum inter agrestis modicis principiis , iam per arma atque acies exercebantur$$ He then put an end to a quarrel between the Censes and the Leptitani ,  which ,  originating in robberies of corn and cattle by two rustic populations ,  had grown from this insignificant beginning till it was carried on in pitched battles
 nam populus Oeensis multitudine inferior Garamantas exciverat , gentem indomitam et inter accolas latrociniis fecundam$$ The people of Ceea ,  who were inferior in numbers ,  had summoned to their aid the Garamantes ,  a wild race incessantly occupied in robbing their neighbours
 unde artae Lepcitanis res , lateque vastatis agris intra moenia trepidabant , donec interventu cohortium alarumque fusi Garamantes et recepta omnis praeda , nisi quam vagi per inaccessa mapalium ulterioribus vendiderant$$ This had brought the Leptitani to extremities their territories had been ravaged far and wide ,  and they were trembling within their walls ,  when the Garamantes were put to flight by the arrival of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry ,  and the whole of the booty was recaptured ,  with the exception of some which the plunderers ,  in their wanderings through inaccessible hamlets ,  had sold to more distant tribes
 Curam restituendi Capitolii in Lucium Vestinum confert , equestris ordinis virum , sed auctoritate famaque inter proceres$$ The work of rebuilding the Capitol was assigned by him to Lucius Vestinius ,  a man of the Equestrian order ,  who ,  however ,  for high character and reputation ranked among the nobles

 perrupta legionum castra , fusi equites , medius Mosellae pons , qui ulteriora coloniae adnectit , ab hostibus insessus Cerialis turbidis rebus intrepidus et fugientis manu retrahens , intecto corpore promptus inter tela , felici temeritate et fortissimi cuiusque adcursu reciperatum pontem electa manu firmavit mox in castra reversus palantis captarum apud Novaesium Bonnamque legionum manipulos et rarum apud signa militem ac prope circumventas aquilas videt$$ He rebuked the alarm of the messengers ,  till the whole extent of the disaster became visible ,  and he saw that the camp of the legions had been forced ,  that the cavalry were routed ,  that the bridge over the Mosella ,  which connected the farther bank of the river with the Colony ,  was held by the Germans Undismayed by the confusion ,  Cerialis held back the fugitives with his own hand ,  and readily exposing himself ,  with his person entirely unprotected ,  to the missiles of the enemy ,  he succeeded by a daring and successful effort ,  with the prompt aid of his bravest soldiers ,  in recovering the bridge and holding it with a picked force

 ipsi territos se cohortium aspectu ferebant , quae primo impetu disiectae summis rursus iugis congregabantur ac speciem novi auxilii fecerant$$ Their own account was ,  that they were alarmed by the sight of the cohorts ,  which ,  after being broken at the first onset ,  rallied on the top of the hills ,  and presented the appearance of reinforcements
 sed obstitit vincentibus pravum inter ipsos certamen omisso hoste spolia consectandi$$ What checked them in their course of victory was a mischievous struggle among themselves to secure plunder while they forgot the enemy

 unde metus et iustae preces invocantium , antequam hostes reparatis viribus ad spem vel ad ultionem accingerentur$$ Hence their alarm and reasonable importunity in begging for help ,  before the enemy ,  recovering their strength ,  could raise their spirits for a new effort or for thoughts of revenge
 namque et Civilis illuc intenderat , non invalidus , flagrantissima cohortium suarum integra , quae e Chaucis Frisiisque composita Tolbiaci in finibus Agrippinensium agebat$$ And indeed Civilis had marched in their direction ,  nor was he by any means weak ,  as he had still ,  in unbroken force ,  the most warlike of his cohorts ,  which consisted of Chauci and Frisii ,  and which was posted at Tolbiacum ,  on the frontiers of the Agrippinenses
 sed tristis nuntius avertit , deletam cohortem dolo Agrippinensium , qui largis epulis vinoque sopitos Germanos , clausis foribus , igne iniecto cremavere$$ He was ,  however ,  diverted from his purpose by the deplorable news that this cohort had been entirely destroyed by a stratagem of the Agrippinenses ,  who ,  having stupefied the Germans by a profuse entertainment and abundance of wine ,  fastened the doors ,  set fire to the houses ,  and burned them
 simul Cerialis propero agmine subvenit$$ At the same time Cerialis advanced by forced marches ,  and relieved the city

 neque Antonium Primum adsciri inter comites a Domitiano passus est , favore militum anxius et superbia viri aequalium quoque , adeo superiorum intolerantis$$ Nor would he suffer Antonius Primus to be taken into the number of Domitian's attendants ,  for he felt uneasy at his popularity with the troops ,  and feared the proud spirit of the man ,  who could not endure an equal ,  much less a superior
 profectus ad Vespasianum Antonius ut non pro spe sua excipitur , ita neque averso imperatoris animo$$ Antonius then went to Vespasian ,  who received him ,  not indeed as he expected ,  but in a not unfriendly spirit
 trahebatur in diversa , hinc meritis Antonii , cuius ductu confectum haud dubie bellum erat , inde Muciani epistulis$$ Two opposite influences acted on the Emperor on the one hand were the merits of Antonius ,  under whose conduct the war had beyond all doubt been terminated
 simul ceteri ut infestum tumidumque insectabantur , adiunctis prioris vitae criminibus$$ on the other ,  were the letters of Mucianus And everyone else inveighed against him ,  as an ill-affected and conceited man ,  nor did they forget the scandals of his early life

 precabaturque principem ut genas et oculorum orbis dignaretur respergere oris excremento$$ He begged Vespasian that he would deign to moisten his cheeks and eye-balls with his spittle

 medici varie disserere$$ They discussed the matter from different points of view
 huic non exesam vim luminis et redituram si pellerentur obstantia$$ In the one case ,  they said ,  the faculty of sight was not wholly destroyed ,  and might return ,  if the obstacies were removed
 illi elapsos in pravum artus , si salubris vis adhibeatur , posse integrari$$ in the other case ,  the limb ,  which had fallen into a diseased condition ,  might be restored ,  if a healing influence were applied
 id fortasse cordi deis et divino ministerio principem electum$$ such ,  perhaps ,  might be the pleasure of the Gods ,  and the Emperor might be chosen to be the minister of the divine will
 denique patrati remedii gloriam penes Caesarem , inriti ludibrium penes miseros fore$$ at any rate ,  all the glory of a successful remedy would be Caesar's ,  while the ridicule of failure would fall on the sufferers
 igitur Vespasianus cuncta fortunae suae patere ratus nec quicquam ultra incredibile , laeto ipse vultu , erecta quae adstabat multitudine , iussa exequitur$$ And so Vespasian ,  supposing that all things were possible to his good fortune ,  and that nothing was any longer past belief ,  with a joyful countenance ,  amid the intense expectation of the multitude of bystanders ,  accomplished what was required
 statim conversa ad usum manus , ac caeco reluxit dies$$ The hand was instantly restored to its use ,  and the light of day again shone upon the blind

 atque illis Ponti et externorum parum gnaris , Timotheum Atheniensem e gente Eumolpidarum , quem ut antistitem caerimoniarum Eleusine exciverat , quaenam illa superstitio , quod numen , interrogat$$ As they knew but little of Pontus or of foreign countries ,  he enquired of Timotheus ,  an Athenian ,  one of the family of the Eumolpids ,  whom he had invited from Eleusis to preside over the sacred rites ,  what this worship was ,  and who was the deity
 Timotheus quaesitis qui in Pontum meassent , cognoscit urbem illic Sinopen , nec procul templum vetere inter accolas fama Iovis Ditis namque et muliebrem effigiem adsistere quam plerique Proserpinam vocent$$ Timotheus ,  questioning persons who had found their way to Pontus ,  learnt that there was there a city Sinope ,  and near it a temple ,  which ,  according to an old tradition of the neighbourhood ,  was sacred to the infernal Jupiter ,  for there also stood close at hand a female figure ,  to which many gave the name of Proserpine
 sed Ptolemaeus , ut sunt ingenia regum , pronus ad formidinem , ubi securitas rediit , voluptatum quam religionum adpetens neglegere paulatim aliasque ad curas animum vertere , donec eadem species terribilior iam et instantior exitium ipsi regnoque denuntiaret ni iussa patrarentur$$ Ptolemy ,  however ,  with the true disposition of a despot ,  though prone to alarm ,  was ,  when the feeling of security returned ,  more intent on pleasures than on religious matters and he began by degrees to neglect the affair ,  and to turn his thoughts to other concerns ,  till at length the same apparition ,  but now more terrible and peremptory ,  denounced ruin against the king and his realm ,  unless his bidding were performed
 tum legatos et dona Scydrothemidi regi (is tunc Sinopensibus imperitabat) expediri iubet praecepitque navigaturis ut Pythicum Apollinem adeant$$ Ptolemy then gave directions that an embassy should be despatched with presents to king Scydrothemis ,  who at that time ruled the people of Sinope ,  and instructed them ,  when they were on the point of sailing ,  to consult the Pythian Apollo

 Causa instruendae classis super insitam genti vanitatem ut eo terrore commeatus Gallia adventantes interciperentur$$ The motive for equipping this fleet was ,  to say nothing of the natural vanity of this people ,  a desire to intercept ,  by this alarming demonstration ,  the supplies that were approaching from Gaul

 Nec classis aut commeatus aderant , castraque in plano sita vi fluminis differebantur$$ There were no ships ,  no provisions at hand ,  and the camp ,  which was situated on low ground ,  was in process of being carried away by the force of the stream
 Potuisse tunc opprimi legiones et voluisse Germanos , sed dolo a se flexos imputavit Civilis$$ That the legions might then have been crushed ,  and that the Germans wished to crush them ,  but were turned from their purpose by his own craft ,  was claimed as a merit by Civilis

 caesos Treviros , receptos Vbios , ereptam Batavis patriam neque aliud Civilis amicitia partum quam vulnera fugas luctus$$ He reminded them that the Treveri had been beaten ,  that the Ubii had submitted ,  that the Batavi had had their country taken from them ,  and that from the friendship of Civilis nothing else had been gained but wounds ,  defeat ,  and mourning

 Si quid ultra moliantur , inde iniuriam et culpam , hinc ultionem et deos fore$$ If they attempted anything more ,  on their side would be the wrong and the guilt ,  with the Romans the vengeance of heaven

 Ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum quoniam , qui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint , ac nunc Tungri , tunc Germani vocati sint$$ The name Germany ,  on the other hand ,  they say ,  is modern and newly introduced ,  from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the Rhine and drove out the Gauls ,  and are now called Tungrians ,  were then called Germans
 ita nationis nomen , non gentis evaluisse paulatim , ut omnes primum a victore ob metum , mox a seipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur$$ Thus what was the name of a tribe ,  and not of a race ,  gradually prevailed ,  till all called themselves by this self-invented name of Germans ,  which the conquerors had first employed to inspire terror

 terrent enim trepidantve , prout sonuit acies$$ For ,  as their line shouts ,  they inspire or feel alarm
 Nec tam voces illae , quam virtutis concentus videntur$$ It is not so much an articulate sound ,  as a general cry of valour
 Affectatur praecipue asperitas soni et fractum murmur , objectis ad os scutis , quo plenior et gravior vox repercussu intumescat$$ They aim chiefly at a harsh note and a confused roar ,  putting their shields to their mouth ,  so that ,  by reverberation ,  it may swell into a fuller and deeper sound
 Ceterum et Ulixem quidam opinantur longo illo et fabuloso errore in hunc Occanum delatum , adisse Germaniae terras , Asciburgiumque , quod in ripa Rheni situm hodieque incolitur , ab illo constitutum nominatumque$$ Ulysses ,  too ,  is believed by some ,  in his long legendary wanderings ,  to have found his way into this ocean ,  and ,  having visited German soil ,  to have founded and named the town of Asciburgium ,  which stands on the bank of the Rhine ,  and is to this day inhabited

 humidior , qua Gallias$$ it is more rainy on the side of Gaul ,  bleaker on that of Noricum and Pannonia
 ventosior , qua Noricum ac Pannoniam aspicit$$ It is productive of grain ,  but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees
 satis ferax frugiferarum arborum impatiens pecorum fecunda , sed plerumque improcera$$ it is rich in flocks and herds ,  but these are for the most part undersized ,  and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head
 ne armentis quidem suus honor , aut gloria frontis$$ It is number that is chiefly valued
 numero gaudent$$ they are in fact the most highly prized ,  indeed the only riches of the people
 eaeque solae et gratissimae opes sunt$$ Silver and gold the gods have refused to them ,  whether in kindness or in anger I cannot say
 Argentum et aurum propitii an irati dii aegaverint , dubito$$ I would not ,  however ,  affirm that no vein of German soil produces gold or silver ,  for who has ever made a search
 Nec tamen affirmaverim , nullam Germaniae venam argentum aurumve gignere$$ They care but little to possess or use them
 quis enim scrutatus est possessione et usu haud perinde afficiuntur$$ You may see among them vessels of silver ,  which have been presented to their envoys and chieftains ,  held as cheap as those of clay
 Est videre apud illos argentea vasa , legatis et principibus eorum muneri data , non in alia vilitate , quam quae humo finguntur quanquam proximi , ob usum commerciorum , aurum et argentum in pretio habent , formasque quasdam nostrae pecuniae agnoscunt atque eligunt$$ The border population ,  however ,  value gold and silver for their commercial utility ,  and are familiar with ,  and show preference for ,  some of our coins The tribes of the interior use the simpler and more ancient practice of the barter of commodities They like the old and well-known money ,  coins milled ,  or showing a two-horse chariot
 interiores simplicius et antiquius permutatione mercium utuntur Pecuniam probant veterem et diu notam , serratos bigatosque$$ They likewise prefer silver to gold ,  not from any special liking ,  but because a large number of silver pieces is more convenient for use among dealers in cheap and common articles
 Ne ferrum quidem superest , sicut ex genere telorum colligitur$$ Even iron is not plentiful with them ,  as we infer from the character of their weapons
 Rari gladiis aut majoribus lanceis utuntur$$ But few use swords or long lances
 hastas , vel ipsorum vocabulo frameas gerunt , angusto et brevi ferro sed ita acri et ad usum habili , ut eodem telo , prout ratio poscit , vel cominus vel eminus pugnent$$ They carry a spear (framea is their name for it) ,  with a narrow and short head ,  but so sharp and easy to wield that the same weapon serves ,  according to circumstances ,  for close or distant conflict
 et eques quidem scuto frameaque contentus est$$ As for the horse-soldier ,  he is satisfied with a shield and spear
 pedites et missilia spargunt , plura singuli , atque in immensum vibrant , nudi aut sagulo leves$$ the foot-soldiers also scatter showers of missiles ,  each man having several and hurling them to an immense distance ,  and being naked or lightly clad with a little cloak

 scuta tantum lectissimis coloribus distinguunt$$  their shields alone are marked with very choice colours
 paucis loricae$$ A few only have corslets ,  and just one or two here and there a metal or leathern helmet
 vix uni alterive cassis aut galea$$ Their horses are remarkable neither for beauty nor for fleetness
 Equi non forma , non velocitate conspicui sed nec variare gyros in morem nostrum docentur$$ Nor are they taught various evolutions after our fashion ,  but are driven straight forward ,  or so as to make one wheel to the right in such a compact body that none is left behind another
 In rectum , aut uno flexu dextros agunt ita conjuncto orbe , ut nemo posterior sit$$ On the whole ,  one would say that their chief strength is in their infantry ,  which fights along with the cavalry
 In universum aestimanti , plus penes peditem roboris eoque mixti proeliantur , apta et congruente ad equestrem pugnam velocitate peditum , quos ex omni juventute delectos ante aciem locant$$ admirably adapted to the action of the latter is the swiftness of certain foot-soldiers ,  who are picked from the entire youth of their country ,  and stationed in front of the line
 Definitur et numerus$$ Their number is fixed ,  a hundred from each canton
 centeni ex singulis pagis sunt$$ and from this they take their name among their countrymen ,  so that what was originally a mere number has now become a title of distinction

 Scutum reliquisse , praecipuum flagitium$$ many ,  indeed ,  after escaping from battle ,  have ended their infamy with the halter
 Reges ex nobilitate , duces ex virtute sumunt$$ They choose their kings by birth ,  their generals for merit
 Nec regibus infinita aut libera potestas$$ These kings have not unlimited or arbitrary power ,  and the generals do more by example than by authority
 et duces exemplo potius , quam imperio , si prompti , si conspicui , si ante aciem agant , admiratione praesunt$$ If they are energetic ,  if they are conspicuous ,  if they fight in the front ,  they lead because they are admired
 Ceterum neque animadvertere neque vincire , ne verberare quidem , nisi sacerdotibus permissum non quasi in poenam , nec ducis jussu , sed velut deo imperante , quem adesse bellantibus credunt$$ But to reprimand ,  to imprison ,  even to flog ,  is permitted to the priests alone ,  and that not as a punishment ,  or at the general's bidding ,  but ,  as it were ,  by the mandate of the god whom they believe to inspire the warrior
 effigiesque et signa quaedam , detracta lucis , in proelium ferunt$$ They also carry with them into battle certain figures and images taken from their sacred groves
 Quodque praecipuum fortitudinis incitamentum est , non casus nec fortuita conglobatio turmam aut cuneum facit , sed familiae et propinquitates , et in proximo pignora , unde feminarum ululatus audiri , unde vagitus infantium$$ And what most stimulates their courage is ,  that their squadrons or battalions ,  instead of being formed by chance or by a fortuitous gathering ,  are composed of families and clans Close by them ,  too ,  are those dearest to them ,  so that they hear the shrieks of women ,  the cries of infants

 Memoriae proditur , quasdam acies , inclinatas jam et labantes , a feminis restitutas , constantia precum et objectu pectorum et monstrata cominus captivitate , quam longe impatientius feminarum suarum nomine timent adeo ut efficacius obligentur animi civitatum , quibus inter obsides puellae quoque nobiles imperantur$$ Tradition says that armies already wavering and giving way have been rallied by women who ,  with earnest entreaties and bosoms laid bare ,  have vividly represented the horrors of captivity ,  which the Germans fear with such extreme dread on behalf of their women ,  that the strongest tie by which a state can be bound is the being required to give ,  among the number of hostages ,  maidens of noble birth
 Inesse quin etiam sanctum aliquid et providum putant nec aut consilia earum aspernantur , aut responsa negligunt$$ They even believe that the sex has a certain sanctity and prescience ,  and they do not despise their counsels ,  or make light of their answers
 Vidimus sub divo Vespasiano Veledam diu apud plerosque numinis loco habitam$$ In Vespasian's days we saw Veleda ,  long regarded by many as a divinity

 Coeunt , nisi quid fortuitum et subitum inciderit , certis diebus , cum aut inchoatur luna aut impletur$$ They assemble ,  except in the case of a sudden emergency ,  on certain fixed days ,  either at new or at full moon
 nam agendis rebus hoc auspicatissimum initium credunt$$ for this they consider the most auspicious season for the transaction of business

 nox ducere diem videtur$$ Night they regard as bringing on day
 Illud ex libertate vitium , quod non simul , nec ut jussi conveniunt , sed et alter et tertius dies cunctatione coeuntium absumitur$$ Their freedom has this disadvantage ,  that they do not meet simultaneously or as they are bidden ,  but two or three days are wasted in the delays of assembling

 Diversitas supplicii illuc respicit , tanquam scelera ostendi oporteat , dum puniuntur , flagitia abscondi$$ This distinction in punishment means that crime ,  they think ,  ought ,  in being punished ,  to be exposed ,  while infamy ought to be buried out of sight
 Sed et levioribus delictis , pro modo poenarum , equorum pecorumque numero convicti mulctantur$$ Lighter offences ,  too ,  have penalties proportioned to them he who is convicted ,  is fined in a certain number of horses or of cattle

 Ne caementorum quidem apud illos aut tegularum usus$$ they employ timber for all purposes ,  rude masses without ornament or attractiveness
 materia ad omnia utuntur informi et citra speciem aut delectationem$$ Some parts of their buildings they stain more carefully with a clay so clear and bright that it resembles painting ,  or a coloured design

 Tegumen omnibus sagum , fibula , aut , si desit , spina consertum cetera intecti totos dies juxta focum atque ignem agunt$$ They all wrap themselves in a cloak which is fastened with a clasp ,  or ,  if this is not forthcoming ,  with a thorn ,  leaving the rest of their persons bare

 sed boves et frenatum equum et scutum cum framea gladioque$$ With these presents the wife is espoused ,  and she herself in her turn brings her husband a gift of arms
 In haec munera uxor accipitur$$ This they count their strongest bond of union ,  these their sacred mysteries ,  these their gods of marriage
 atque invicem ipsa armorum aliquid viro affert hoc maximum vinculum , haec arcana sacra , hos conjugales deos arbitrantur Ne se mulier extra virtutum cogitationes extraque bellorum casus putet , ipsis incipientis matrimonii auspiciis admonetur , venire se laborum periculorumque sociam , idem in pace , idem in proelio passuram ausuramque hoc juncti boves , hoc paratus equus , hoc data arma denuntiant$$ Lest the woman should think herself to stand apart from aspirations after noble deeds and from the perils of war ,  she is reminded by the ceremony which inaugurates marriage that she is her husband's partner in toil and danger ,  destined to suffer and to dare with him alike both in peace and in war The yoked oxen ,  the harnessed steed ,  the gift of arms ,  proclaim this fact She must live and die with the feeling that she is receiving what she must hand down to her children neither tarnished nor depreciated ,  what future daughters-in-law may receive ,  and may be so passed on to her grand-children

 Si indulseris ebrietati suggerendo quantum concupiscunt , haud minus facile vitiis , quam armis vincentur$$ If you indulge their love of drinking by supplying them with as much as they desire ,  they will be overcome by their own vices as easily as by the arms of an enemy
 Ceteris servis , non in nostrum morem descriptis per familiam ministeriis , utuntur Suam quisque sedem , suos penates regit$$ The other slaves are not employed after our manner with distinct domestic duties assigned to them ,  but each one has the management of a house and home of his own
 Frumenti modum dominus , aut pecoris aut vestis , ut colono , injungit et servus hactenus paret$$ The master requires from the slave a certain quantity of grain ,  of cattle ,  and of clothing ,  as he would from a tenant ,  and this is the limit of subjection
 cetera domus officia uxor ac liberi exsequuntur$$ All other household functions are discharged by the wife and children
 Verberare servum ac vinculis et opere coercere , rarum$$ To strike a slave or to punish him with bonds or with hard labour is a rare occurrence

 Liberti non multum supra servos sunt , raro aliquod momentum in domo , nunquam in civitate exceptis duntaxat iis gentibus , quae regnantur$$ The freedmen do not rank much above slaves ,  and are seldom of any weight in the family ,  never in the state ,  with the exception of those tribes which are ruled by kings
 ibi enim et super ingenuos et super nobiles ascendunt$$ There indeed they rise above the freedborn and the noble
 apud ceteros impares libertini libertatis argumentum sunt$$ elsewhere the inferiority of the freedman marks the freedom of the state
 Fenus agitare et in usuras extendere , igno tum ideoque magis servatur , quam si vetitum esset Agri pro numero cultorum ab universis in vices occupantur , quos mox inter se secundum dignationem partiuntur facilitatem partiendi camporum spatia praestant Arva per annos mutant et superest ager nec enim cum ubertate et amplitudine soli labore contendunt , ut pomaria conserant et prata separent et hortos rigent sola terrae seges imperatur Unde annum quoque ipsum non in totidem digerunt species hiems et ver et aestas intellectum ac vocabula habent autumni perinde nomen ac bona ignorantur$$ Of lending money on interest and increasing it by compound interest they know nothing ,  a more effectual safeguard than if it were prohibited

 Omnium harum gentium virtute praecipui Batavi , non multum ex ripa , sed insulam Rheni amnis colunt , Chattorum quondam populus et seditione domestica in eas sedes transgressus , in quibus pars Romani imperii fierent$$ Foremost among all these nations in valour ,  the Batavi occupy an island within the Rhine and but a small portion of the bank Formerly a tribe of the Chatti ,  they were forced by internal dissension to migrate to their present settlements and there become a part of the Roman Empire
 Manet honos et antiquae societatis insigne$$ They yet retain the honourable badge of an ancient alliance

 protulit enim magnitudo populi Romani ultra Rhenum , ultraque veteres terminos , imperii reverentiam$$ For the greatness of the Roman people has spread reverence for our empire beyond the Rhine and the old boundaries
 Ita sede finibusque in sua ripa , mente animoque nobiscum agunt , cetera similes Batavis , nisi quod ipso adhuc terrae suae solo et coelo acrius animantur$$ Thus this nation ,  whose settlements and territories are on their own side of the river ,  are yet in sentiment and purpose one with us in all other respects they resemble the Batavi ,  except that they still gain from the soil and climate of their native land a keener vigour
 Non numeraverim inter Germaniae populos , quanquam trans Rhenum Danubiumque consederint , eos , qui Decumates agros exercent$$ I should not reckon among the German tribes the cultivators of the tithe-lands ,  although they are settled on the further side of the Rhine and Danube
 Levissimus quisque Gallorum et inopia audax , dubiae possessionis solum occupavere$$ Reckless adventurers from Gaul ,  emboldened by want ,  occupied this land of questionable ownership
 Mox limite acto promotisque praesidiis , sinus imperii et pars provinciae habentur$$ After a while ,  our frontier having been advanced ,  and our military positions pushed forward ,  it was regarded as a remote nook of our empire and a part of a Roman province
 Ultra hos Chatti initium sedis ab Hercynio saltu inchoant , non ita effusis ac palustribus locis ut ceterae civitates , in quas Germania patescit$$ Beyond them are the Chatti ,  whose settlements begin at the Hercynian forest ,  where the country is not so open and marshy as in the other cantons into which Germany stretches
 durant siquidem colles , paulatim rarescunt , et Chattos suos saltus Hercynius prosequitur simul atque deponit$$ They are found where there are hills ,  and with them grow less frequent ,  for the Hercynian forest keeps close till it has seen the last of its native Chatti
 Duriora genti corpora , stricti artus , minax vultus et major animi vigor$$ Hardy frames ,  close-knit limbs ,  fierce countenances ,  and a peculiarly vigorous courage ,  mark the tribe
 Multum , ut inter Germanos , rationis ac solertiae$$ For Germans ,  they have much intelligence and sagacity

 quodque rarissimum nec nisi ratione disciplinae concessum , plus reponere in duce , quam exercitu$$ and what is most unusual ,  and only given to systematic discipline ,  they rely more on the general than on the army
 Omne robur in pedite , quem , super arma , ferramentis quoque et copiis onerant$$ Their whole strength is in their infantry ,  which ,  in addition to its arms ,  is laden with iron tools and provisions
 Alios ad proelium ire videas , Chattos ad bellum$$ Other tribes you see going to battle ,  the Chatti to a campaign
 Rari excursus et fortuita pugna$$ Seldom do they engage in mere raids and casual encounters
 equestrium sane virium id proprium , cito parare victoriam , cito cedere$$ It is indeed the peculiarity of a cavalry force quickly to win and as quickly to yield a victory

 Proximi Chattis certum jam alveo Rhenum , quique terminus esse sufficiat , Usipii ac Tencteri colunt$$ Next to the Chatti on the Rhine ,  which has now a well-defined channel ,  and serves as a boundary ,  dwell the Usipii and Tencteri
 Tencteri , super solitum bellorum decus , equestris disciplinae arte praecellunt nec major apud Chattos peditum laus , quam Tencteris equitum$$ The latter ,  besides the more usual military distinctions ,  particularly excel in the organisation of cavalry ,  and the Chatti are not more famous for their foot-soldiers than are the Tencteri for their horsemen
 Sic instituere majores , posteri imitantur$$ What their forefathers originated ,  posterity maintain
 hi lusus infantium , haec juvenum aemulatio , perseverant senes inter familiam et penates et jura successionum equi traduntur$$ This supplies sport to their children ,  rivalry to their youths   even the aged keep it up Horses are bequeathed along with the slaves ,  the dwelling-house ,  and the usual rights of inheritance
 excipit filius , non , ut cetera , maximus natu , sed prout ferox bello et melior$$ they go to the son ,  not to the eldest ,  as does the other property ,  but to the most warlike and courageous
 Angrivarios et Chamavos a tergo Dulgibini et Chasuarii cludunt aliaeque gentes , haud perinde memoratae$$ The Angrivarii and Chamavi are bounded in the rear by the Dulgubini and Chasuarii ,  and other tribes not equally famous
 A fronte Frisii excipiunt Majoribus minoribusque Frisiis vocabulum est ex modo virium$$ Towards the river are the Frisii ,  distinguished as the Greater and Lesser Frisii ,  according to their strength
 utraeque nationes usque ad Oceanum Rheno praetexuntur , ambiuntque immensos insuper lacus et Romanis classibus navigatos$$ Both these tribes ,  as far as the ocean ,  are skirted by the Rhine ,  and their territory also embraces vast lakes which Roman fleets have navigated
 Ipsum quin etiam Oceanum illa tentavimus$$ We have even ventured on the ocean itself in these parts
 et superesse adhuc Herculis columnas fama vulgavit$$ Pillars of Hercules ,  so rumour commonly says ,  still exist
 sive adiit Hercules , seu , quicquid ubique magnificum est , in claritatem ejus referre consensimus$$ whether Hercules really visited the country ,  or whether we have agreed to ascribe every work of grandeur ,  wherever met with ,  to his renown
 Nec defuit audentia Druso Germanico$$ Drusus Germanicus indeed did not lack daring
 sed obstitit Oceanus in se simul atque in Herculem inquiri$$ but the ocean barred the explorer's access to itself and to Hercules
 Mox nemo tentavit sanctiusque ac reverentius visum , de actis deorum credere , quam scire$$ Subsequently no one has made the attempt ,  and it has been thought more pious and reverential to believe in the actions of the gods than to inquire
 Hactenus in Occidentem Germaniam novimus$$ Thus far we have taken note of Western Germany
 In Septentrionem ingenti flexu redit$$ Northwards the country takes a vast sweep
 Ac primo statim Chaucorum gens , quanquam incipiat a Frisiis ac partem littoris occupet , omnium , quas exposui , gentium lateribus obtenditur , donec in Chattos usque sinuetur$$ First comes the tribe of the Chauci ,  which ,  beginning at the Frisian settlements ,  and occupying a part of the coast ,  stretches along the frontier of all the tribes which I have enumerated ,  till it reaches with a bend as far as the Chatti
 Tam immensum terrarum spatium non tenent tantum Chauci , sed et implent populus inter Germanos nobilissimus , quique magnitudinem suam malit justitia tueri$$ This vast extent of country is not merely possessed ,  but densely peopled ,  by the Chauci ,  the noblest of the German races ,  a nation who would maintain their greatness by righteous dealing
 sine cupiditate , sine impotentia , quieti secretique , nulla provocant bella , nullis raptibus aut latrociniis populantur$$ Without ambition ,  without lawless violence ,  they live peaceful and secluded ,  never provoking a war or injuring others by rapine and robbery
 Id praecipuum virtutis ac virium argumentum est , quod , ut superiores agant , non per injurias assequuntur$$ Indeed ,  the crowning proof of their valour and their strength is ,  that they keep up their superiority without harm to others
 Prompta tamen omnibus arma , ac , si res poscat , exercitus , plurimum virorum equorumque$$ Yet all have their weapons in readiness ,  and an army if necessary ,  with a multitude of men and horses
 et quiescentibus eadem fama$$ and even while at peace they have the same renown of valour
 In latere Chaucorum Chattorumque Cherusci nimiam ac marcentem diu pacem illacessiti nutrierunt$$ Dwelling on one side of the Chauci and Chatti ,  the Cherusci long cherished ,  unassailed ,  an excessive and enervating love of peace
 idque jucundius , quam tutius , fuit quia inter impotentes et validos falso quiescas$$ This was more pleasant than safe ,  for to be peaceful is self-deception among lawless and powerful neighbours
 ubi manu agitur , modestia ac probitas nomina superioris sunt$$ Where the strong hand decides ,  moderation and justice are terms applied only to the more powerful
 Ita , qui olim boni aequique Cherusci , nunc inertes ac stulti vocantur Chattis victoribus fortuna in sapientiam cessit$$ and so the Cherusci ,  ever reputed good and just ,  are now called cowards and fools ,  while in the case of the victorious Chatti success has been identified with prudence
 Tracti ruina Cheruscorum et Fosi , contermina gens , adversarum rerum ex aequo socii , cum in secundis minores fuissent$$ The downfall of the Cherusci brought with it also that of the Fosi ,  a neighbouring tribe ,  which shared equally in their disasters ,  though they had been inferior to them in prosperous days
 Eundem Germaniae sinum proximi Oceano Cimbri tenent , parva nunc civitas , sed gloria ingens$$ In the same remote corner of Germany ,  bordering on the ocean dwell the Cimbri ,  a now insignificant tribe ,  but of great renown
 veterisque famae lata vestigia manent , utraque ripa castra ac spatia , quorum ambitu nunc quoque metiaris molem manusque gentis et tam magni exitus fidem$$ Of their ancient glory widespread traces yet remain on both sides of the Rhine are encampments of vast extent ,  and by their circuit you may even now measure the warlike strength of the tribe ,  and find evidence of that mighty emigration
 Sexcentesimum et quadragesimum annum urbs nostra agebat , cum primum Cimbrorum audita sunt arma , Caecilio Metello et Papirio Carbone consulibus$$ Rome was in her 640th year when we first heard of the Cimbrian invader in the consulship of Cæcilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo ,  from which time to the second consulship of the Emperor Trajan we have to reckon about 210 years
 Ex quo si ad alterum Imperatoris Trajani consulatum computemus , ducenti ferme et decem anni colliguntur$$ So long have we been in conquering Germany
 tamdiu Germania vincitur$$ In the space of this long epoch many losses have been sustained on both sides
 Medio tam longi aevi spatio , multa invicem damna$$ Neither Samnite nor Carthaginian ,  neither Spain nor Gaul ,  not even the Parthians ,  have given us more frequent warnings
 non Samnis , non Poeni , non Hispaniae Galliaeve , ne Parthi quidem saepius admonuere$$ German independence truly is fiercer than the despotism of an Arsaces
 quippe regno Arsacis acrior est Germanorum libertas$$ What else ,  indeed ,  can the East taunt us with but the slaughter of Crassus ,  when it has itself lost Pacorus ,  and been crushed under a Ventidius
 Quid enim aliud nobis , quam caedem Crassi , amisso et ipse Pacoro , infra Ventidium dejectus Oriens objecerit At Germani , Carbone et Cassio et Scauro Aurelio et Servilio Caepione , Marcus quoque Manlio fusis vel captis , quinque simul consulares exercitus Populo Romano , Varum , tresque cum eo legiones , etiam Caesari abstulerunt$$ But Germans ,  by routing or making prisoners of Carbo ,  Cassius ,  Scaurus Aurelius ,  Servilius Cæpio ,  and Marcus Manlius ,  deprived the Roman people of five consular armies ,  and they robbed even a Cæsar of Varus and his three legions Not without loss to us were they discomfited by Marius in Italy ,  by the great Julius in Gaul ,  and by Drusus ,  Nero ,  and Germanicus ,  on their own ground
 nec impune Gaius Marius in Italia , divus Julius in Gallia , Drusus ac Nero et Germanicus in suis eos sedibus perculerunt$$ Soon after ,  the mighty menaces of Caius Cæsar were turned into a jest
 Mox ingentes Gaius Caesaris minae in ludibrium versae Inde otium , donec occasione discordiae nostrae et civilium armorum , expugnatis legionum hibernis , etiam Gallias affectavere$$ Then came a lull ,  until on the occasion of our discords and the civil war ,  they stormed the winter camp of our legions ,  and even designed the conquest of Gaul
 ac rursus pulsi , inde proximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi sunt$$ Again were they driven back
 Nunc de Suevis dicendum est , quorum non una , ut Chattorum Tencterorumve , gens majorem enim Germaniae partem obtinent , propriis adhuc nationibus nominibusque discreti , quanquam in commune Suevi vocentur$$ I must now speak of the Suevi ,  who are not one nation as are the Chatti and Tencteri ,  for they occupy the greater part of Germany ,  and have hitherto been divided into separate tribes with names of their own ,  though they are called by the general designation of Suevi
 Insigne gentis obliquare crinem nodoque substringere sic Suevi a ceteris Germanis , sic Suevorum ingenui a servis separantur in aliis gentibus , seu cognatione aliqua Suevorum , seu quod saepe accidit , imitatione , rarum et intra juventae spatium$$ A national peculiarity with them is to twist their hair back ,  and fasten it in a knot This distinguishes the Suevi from the other Germans ,  as it also does their own freeborn from their slaves With other tribes ,  either from some connection with the Suevic race ,  or ,  as often happens ,  from imitation ,  the practice is an occasional one ,  and restricted to youth
 apud Suevos , usque ad canitiem , horrentem capillum retro sequuntur , ac saepe in ipso solo vertice religant$$ The Suevi ,  till their heads are grey ,  affect the fashion of drawing back their unkempt locks ,  and often they are knotted on the very top of the head
 Principes et ornatiorem habent$$ The chiefs have a more elaborate style
 ea cura formae , sed innoxiae neque enim ut ament amenturve$$ so much do they study appearance ,  but in perfect innocence ,  not with any thoughts of love-making
 in altitudinem quandam et terrorem , adituri bella , compti , ut hostium oculis , ornantur$$ but arranging their hair when they go to battle ,  to make themselves tall and terrible ,  they adorn themselves ,  so to speak ,  for the eyes of the foe
 Vetustissimos se nobilissimosque Suevorum Semnones memorant$$ The Semnones give themselves out to be the most ancient and renowned branch of the Suevi
 Fides antiquitatis religione firmatur$$ Their antiquity is strongly attested by their religion
 Stato tempore in silvam auguriis patrum et prisca formidine sacram , omnes ejusdem sanguinis populi legationibus coeunt , caesoque publice homine celebrant barbari ritus horrenda primordia$$ At a stated period ,  all the tribes of the same race assemble by their representatives in a grove consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers ,  and by immemorial associations of terror Here ,  having publicly slaughtered a human victim ,  they celebrate the horrible beginning of their barbarous rite
 Est et alia luco reverentia$$ Reverence also in other ways is paid to the grove
 Nemo nisi vinculo ligatus ingreditur , ut minor et potestatem numinis prae se ferens , Si forte prolapsus est , attolli et insurgere haud licitum$$ No one enters it except bound with a chain ,  as an inferior acknowledging the might of the local divinity If he chance to fall ,  it is not lawful for him to be lifted up ,  or to rise to his feet
 per humum evolvuntur$$ he must crawl out along the ground
 eoque omnis superstitio respicit , tanquam inde initia gentis , ibi regnator omnium deus , cetera subjecta atque parentia$$ All this superstition implies the belief that from this spot the nation took its origin ,  that here dwells the supreme and all-ruling deity ,  to whom all else is subject and obedient
 Adjicit auctoritatem fortuna Semnonum$$ The fortunate lot of the Semnones strengthens this belief
 centum pagis habitantur magnoque corpore efficitur , ut se Suevorum caput credant$$ a hundred cantons are in their occupation ,  and the vastness of their community makes them regard themselves as the head of the Suevic race
 Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat$$ To the Langobardi ,  on the contrary ,  their scanty numbers are a distinction
 plurimis ac valentissimis nationibus cincti , non per obsequium , sed proeliis et periclitando tuti sunt$$ Though surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes ,  they are safe ,  not by submitting ,  but by daring the perils of war
 Reudigni deinde et Aviones et Anglii et Varini et Eudoses et Suardones et Nuithones fluminibus aut silvis muniuntur$$ Next come the Reudigni ,  the Aviones ,  the Anglii ,  the Varini ,  the Eudoses ,  the Suardones ,  and Nuithones who are fenced in by rivers or forests
 nec quidquam notabile in singulis , nisi quod in commune Nerthum , id est Terram matrem colunt , eamque intervenire rebus hominum , invehi populis arbitrantur$$ None of these tribes have any noteworthy feature ,  except their common worship of Ertha ,  or mother-Earth ,  and their belief that she interposes in human affairs ,  and visits the nations in her car
 Est in insula Oceani castum nemus , dicatumque in eo vehiculum , veste contectum attingere uni sacerdoti concessum$$ In an island of the ocean there is a sacred grove ,  and within it a consecrated chariot ,  covered over with a garment
 Is adesse penetrali deam intelligit , vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur$$ Only one priest is permitted to touch it He can perceive the presence of the goddess in this sacred recess ,  and walks by her side with the utmost reverence as she is drawn along by heifers
 Laeti tunc dies , festa loca , quaecumque adventu hospitioque dignatur$$ It is a season of rejoicing ,  and festivity reigns wherever she deigns to go and be received
 Non bella ineunt , non arma sumunt$$ They do not go to battle or wear arms
 clausum omne ferrum$$ every weapon is under lock
 pax et quies tunc tantum nota , tunc tantum amata , donec idem sacerdos satiatam conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat$$ peace and quiet are known and welcomed only at these times ,  till the goddess ,  weary of human intercourse ,  is at length restored by the same priest to her temple
 Mox vehiculum et vestes , et , si credere velis , numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur$$ Afterwards the car ,  the vestments ,  and ,  if you like to believe it ,  the divinity herself ,  are purified in a secret lake
 Servi ministrant , quos statim idem lacus haurit$$ Slaves perform the rite ,  who are instantly swallowed up by its waters
 arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia , quid sit illud , quod tantum perituri vident$$ Hence arises a mysterious terror and a pious ignorance concerning the nature of that which is seen only by men doomed to die
 Retro Marsigni , Gothini , Osi , Burii , terga Marcomannorum Quadorumque claudunt$$ Behind them the Marsigni ,  Gotini ,  Osi ,  and Buri ,  close in the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi
 e quibus Marsigni et Burii sermone cultuque Suevos referunt Gothinos Gallica , Osos Pannonica lingua coarguit non esse Germanos , et quod tributa patiuntur$$ Of these ,  the Marsigni and Buri ,  in their language and manner of life ,  resemble the Suevi The Gotini and Osi are proved by their respective Gallic and Pannonian tongues ,  as well as by the fact of their enduring tribute ,  not to be Germans
 Partem tributorum Sarmatae , partem Quadi , ut alienigenis , imponunt$$ Tribute is imposed on them as aliens ,  partly by the Sarmatæ ,  partly by the Quadi
 Gothini , quo magis pudeat , et ferrum effodiunt$$ The Gotini ,  to complete their degradation ,  actually work iron mines
 Omnesque hi populi pauca campestrium , ceterum saltus et vertices montium jugumque insederunt$$ All these nations occupy but little of the plain country ,  dwelling in forests and on mountain-tops
 Dirimit enim scinditque Sueviam continuum montium jugum , ultra quod plurimae gentes agunt$$ For Suevia is divided and cut in half by a continuous mountain-range ,  beyond which live a multitude of tribes
 ex quibus latissime patet Lygiorum nomen in plures civitates diffusum$$ The name of Ligii ,  spread as it is among many states ,  is the most widely extended
 Valentissimas nominasse sufficiet , Arios , Helveconas , Manimos , Elysios , Naharvalos$$ It will be enough to mention the most powerful ,  which are the Harii ,  the Helvecones ,  the Manimi ,  the Helisii and the Nahanarvali
 Apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur$$ Among these last is shown a grove of immemorial sanctity
 Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu$$ A priest in female attire has the charge of it
 sed deos , interpretatione Romana , Castorem Pollucemque memorant$$ But the deities are described in Roman language as Castor and Pollux
 ea vis numini$$ Such ,  indeed ,  are the attributes of the divinity ,  the name being Alcis
 nomen Alcis Nulla simulacra , nullum peregrinae superstitionis vestigium$$ They have no images ,  or ,  indeed ,  any vestige of foreign superstition ,  but it is as brothers and as youths that the deities are worshipped
 ut fratres tamen , ut juvenes , venerantur Ceterum Arii super vires , quibus enumeratos paulo ante populos antecedunt , truces , insitae feritati arte ac tempore lenocinantur$$ The Harii ,  besides being superior in strength to the tribes just enumerated ,  savage as they are ,  make the most of their natural ferocity by the help of art and opportunity
 Nigra scuta , tincta corpora$$ Their shields are black ,  their bodies dyed
 atras ad proelia noctes legunt ipsaque formidine atque umbra feralis exercitus terrorem inferant , nullo hostium sustinente novum ac velut infernum aspectum$$ They choose dark nights for battle ,  and ,  by the dread and gloomy aspect of their death-like host ,  strike terror into the foe ,  who can never confront their strange and almost infernal appearance
 nam primi in omnibus proeliis oculi vincuntur$$ For in all battles it is the eye which is first vanquished
 Trans Suionas aliud mare , pigrum ac prope immotum , quo cingi cludique terrarum orbem hinc fides , quod extremus cadentis jam solis fulgor in ortus edurat adeo clarus , ut sidera hebetet sonum insuper audiri , formasque deorum et radios capitis aspici persuasio adjicit Illuc usque , et fama vera , tantum natura Ergo jam dextro Suevici maris littore Aestyorum gentes alluuntur quibus ritus habitusque Suevorum lingua Britannicae propior Matrem deum venerantur insigne superstitionis , formas aprorum gestant id pro armis omnique tutela securum deae cultorem etiam inter hostes praestat Rarus ferri , frequens fustium usus Frumenta ceterosque fructus patientius , quam pro solita Germanorum inertia , laborant Sed et mare scrutantur , ac soli omnium succinum , quod ipsi glesum vocant inter vada atque in ipso littore legunt Nec , quae natura quaeve ratio gignat , ut barbaris , quaesitum compertumve Diu quin etiam inter cetera ejectamenta maris jacebat , donec luxuria nostra dedit nomen$$ Beyond the Suiones is another sea ,  sluggish and almost motionless ,  which ,  we may certainly infer ,  girdles and surrounds the world ,  from the fact that the last radiance of the setting sun lingers on till sunrise ,  with a brightness sufficient to dim the light of the stars
 ipsis in nullo usu rude legitur , informe perfertur , pretiumque mirantes accipiunt Succum tamen arborum esse intelligas , quia terrena quaedam atque etiam volucria animalia plerumque interlucent , quae implicata humore , mox , durescente materia , cluduntur Fecundiora igitur nemora lucosque , sicut Orientis secretis , ubi thura balsamaque sudantur , ita Occidentis insulis terrisque inesse , crediderim quae vicini solis radiis expressa atque liquentia in proximum mare labuntur , ac vi tempestatum in adversa littora exundant$$ Even the very sound of his rising ,  as popular belief adds ,  may be heard ,  and the forms of gods and the glory round his head may be seen
 Si naturam succini admoto igne tentes , in modum taedae accenditur , alitque flammam pinguem et olentem mox ut in picem resinamve lentescit Suionibus Sitonum gentes continuantur$$ Only thus far (and here rumour seems truth) does the world extend
 Peucinorum Vene dorumque et Fennorum nationes Germanis an Sarmatis ascribam , dubito quanquam Peucini , quos quidam Bastarnas vocant , sermone , cultu , sede ac domiciliis , ut Germani , agunt$$ As to the tribes of the Peucini ,  Veneti ,  and Fenni ,  I am in doubt whether I should class them with the Germans or the Sarmatæ ,  although indeed the Peucini called by some Bastarnæ ,  are like Germans in their language ,  mode of life ,  and in the permanence of their settlements
 Sordes omnium ac torpor procerum connubiis mixtis , nonnihil in Sarmatarum habitum foedantur$$ They all live in filth and sloth ,  and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the Sarmatæ
 Venedi multum ex moribus traxerunt$$ The Veneti have borrowed largely from the Sarmatian character
 Nam quidquid inter Peucinos Fennosque silvarum ac montium erigitur , latrociniis pererrant$$ in their plundering expeditions they roam over the whole extent of forest and mountain between the Peucini and Fenni
 Hi tamen inter Germanos potius referuntur , quia et domos figunt et scuta gestant et pedum usu ac pernicitate gaudent$$ They are however to be rather referred to the German race ,  for they have fixed habitations ,  carry shields ,  and delight in strength and fleetness of foot ,  thus presenting a complete contrast to the Sarmatæ ,  who live in waggons and on horseback
 quae omnia diversa Sarmatis sunt , in plaustro equoque viventibus$$ The Fenni are strangely beastlike and squalidly poor
 Fennis mira feritas , foeda paupertas$$ neither arms nor homes have they
 non arma , non equi , non penates$$ their food is herbs ,  their clothing skins ,  their bed the earth
 victui herba , vestitui pelles , cubile humus$$ They trust wholly to their arrows ,  which ,  for want of iron ,  are pointed with bone
 sola in sagittis spes , quas , inopia ferri , ossibus asperant$$ The men and the women are alike supplied by the chase
 Idemque venatus viros pariter ac feminas alit$$ for the latter are always present ,  and demand a share of the prey
 Passim enim comitantur , partemque praedae petunt$$ The little children have no shelter from wild beasts and storms but a covering of interlaced boughs
 Nec aliud infantibus ferarum imbriumque suffugium , quam ut in aliquo ramorum nexu contegantur$$ Such are the homes of the young ,  such the resting place of the old
 huc redeunt juvenes , hoc senum receptaculum Sed beatius arbitrantur , quam ingemere agris , illaborare domibus , suas alienasque fortunas spe metuque versare$$ Yet they count this greater happiness than groaning over field-labour ,  toiling at building ,  and poising the fortunes of themselves and others between hope and fear
 Securi adversus homines , securi adversus deos , rem difficillimam assecuti sunt , ut illis ne vote quidem opus esset$$ Heedless of men ,  heedless of gods ,  they have attained that hardest of results ,  the not needing so much as a wish
 Legimus , cum Aruleno Rustico Paetus Thrasea , Herennio Senecioni Priscus Helvidius laudati essent , capitale fuisse , neque in ipsos modo auctores , sed in libros quoque eorum saevitum , delegato triumviris ministerio ut monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro urerentur$$ We have read that the panegyrics pronounced by Arulenus Rusticus on Rictus Thrasea ,  and by Herennius Senecio on Priscus Helvidius ,  were made capital crimes ,  that not only their persons but their very books were objects of rage ,  and that the triumvirs were commissioned to burn in the forum those works of splendid genius
 Scilicet illo igne vocem populi Romani et libertatem senatus et conscientiam generis humani aboleri arbitrabantur , expulsis insuper sapientiae professoribus atque omni bona arte in exilium acta , ne quid usquam honestum occurreret$$ They fancied ,  forsooth that in that fire the voice of the Roman people ,  the freedom of the Senate ,  and the conscience of the human race were perishing ,  while at the same time they banished the teachers of philosophy ,  and exiled every noble pursuit ,  that nothing good might anywhere confront them
 Dedimus profecto grande patientiae documentum$$ Certainly we showed a magnificent example of patience
 et sicut vetus aetas vidit quid ultimum in libertate esset , ita nos quid in servitute , adempto per inquisitiones etiam loquendi audiendique commercio$$ as a former age had witnessed the extreme of liberty ,  so we witnessed the extreme of servitude ,  when the informer robbed us of the interchange of speech and hearing

 et quamquam primo statim beatissimi saeculi ortu Nerva Caesar res olim dissociabilis miscuerit , principatum ac libertatem , augeatque cotidie felicitatem temporum Nerva Traianus , nec spem modo ac votum securitas publica , sed ipsius voti fiduciam ac robur adsumpserit , natura tamen infirmitatis humanae tardiora sunt remedia quam mala$$ And yet ,  though at the dawn of a most happy age Nerva Cæsar blended things once irreconcilable ,  sovereignty and freedom ,  though Nerva Trajan is now daily augmenting the prosperity of the time ,  and though the public safety has not only our hopes and good wishes ,  but has also the certain pledge of their fulfillment ,  still ,  from the necessary condition of human frailty ,  the remedy works less quickly than the disease
 et ut corpora nostra lente augescunt , cito extinguuntur , sic ingenia studiaque oppresseris facilius quam revocaveris$$ As our bodies grow but slowly ,  perish in a moment ,  so it is easier to crush than to revive genius and its pursuits
 subit quippe etiam ipsius inertiae dulcedo , et invisa primo desidia postremo amatur$$ Besides ,  the charm of indolence steals over us ,  and the idleness which at first we loathed we afterwards love
 Quid , si per quindecim annos , grande mortalis aevi spatium , multi fortuitis casibus , promptissimus quisque saevitia principis interciderunt , pauci et , ut ita dixerim , non modo aliorum sed etiam nostri superstites sumus , exemptis e media vita tot annis , quibus iuvenes ad senectutem , senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis terminos per silentium venimus Non tamen pigebit vel incondita ac rudi voce memoriam prioris servitutis ac testimonium praesentium bonorum composuisse$$ What if during those fifteen years ,  a large portion of human life ,  many were cut off by ordinary casualties ,  and the ablest fell victims to the Emperor's rage ,  if a few of us survive ,  I may almost say ,  not only others but our ownselves ,  survive ,  though there have been taken from the midst of life those many years which brought the young in dumb silence to old age ,  and the old almost to the very verge and end of existence! Yet we shall not regret that we have told ,  though in language unskilful and unadorned ,  the story of past servitude ,  and borne our testimony to present happiness
 Hic interim liber honori Agricolae soceri mei destinatus , professione pietatis aut laudatus erit aut excusatus$$ Meanwhile this book ,  intended to do honour to Agricola ,  my father-in-law ,  will ,  as an expression of filial regard ,  be commended ,  or at least excused

 Memoria teneo solitum ipsum narrare se prima in iuventa studium philosophiae acrius , ultra quam concessum Romano ac senatori , hausisse , ni prudentia matris incensum ac flagrantem animum coercuisset$$ I remember that he used to tell us how in his early youth he would have imbibed a keener love of philosophy than became a Roman and a senator ,  had not his mother's good sense checked his excited and ardent spirit
 Scilicet sublime et erectum ingenium pulchritudinem ac speciem magnae excelsaeque gloriae vehementius quam caute adpetebat$$ It was the case of a lofty and aspiring soul craving with more eagerness than caution the beauty and splendour of great and glorious renown
 Mox mitigavit ratio et aetas , retinuitque , quod est difficillimum , ex sapientia modum$$ But it was soon mellowed by reason and experience ,  and he retained from his learning that most difficult of lessons moderation

 Idem praeturae tenor et silentium nec enim iurisdictio obvenerat Ludos et inania honoris medio rationis atque abundantiae duxit , uti longe a luxuria ita famae propior Tum electus a Galba ad dona templorum recognoscenda diligentissima conquisitione effecit , ne cuius alterius sacrilegium res publica quam Neronis sensisset$$ However ,  the good wife deserves the greater praise ,  just as the bad incurs a heavier censure
 Sequens annus gravi vulnere animum domumque eius adflixit Nam classis Othoniana licenter vaga dum Intimilium (Liguriae pars est) hostiliter populatur , matrem Agricolae in praediis suis interfecit , praediaque ipsa et magnam patrimonii partem diripuit , quae causa caedis fuerat$$ The following year inflicted a terrible blow on his affections and his fortunes Otho's fleet ,  while cruising idly about ,  cruelly ravaged Intemelii ,  a district of Liguria

 Silurum colorati vultus , torti plerumque crines et posita contra Hispania Hiberos veteres traiecisse easque sedes occupasse fidem faciunt$$ The dark complexion of the Silures ,  their usually curly hair ,  and the fact that Spain is the opposite shore to them ,  are an evidence that Iberians of a former date crossed over and occupied these parts
 proximi Gallis et similes sunt , seu durante originis vi , seu procurrentibus in diversa terris positio caeli corporibus habitum dedit$$ Those who are nearest to the Gauls are also like them ,  either from the permanent influence of original descent ,  or ,  because in countries which run out so far to meet each other ,  climate has produced similar physical qualities

 Mox bella civilia et in rem publicam versa principum arma , ac longa oblivio Britanniae etiam in pace$$  must be regarded as having indicated rather than transmitted the acquisition to future generations
 consilium id divus Augustus vocabat , Tiberius praeceptum Agitasse Gaium Caesarem de intranda Britannia satis constat , ni velox ingenio mobili paenitentiae , et ingentes adversus Germaniam conatus frustra fuissent Divus Claudius auctor iterati operis , transvectis legionibus auxiliisque et adsumpto in partem rerum Vespasiano , quod initium venturae mox fortunae fuit domitae gentes , capti reges et monstratus fatis Vespasianus$$ Then came the civil wars ,  and the arms of our leaders were turned against their country ,  and even when there was peace ,  there was a long neglect of Britain This Augustus spoke of as policy Tiberius as an inherited maxim That Caius Cæsar meditated an invasion of Britain is perfectly clear ,  but his purposes ,  rapidly formed ,  were easily changed ,  and his vast attempts on Germany had failed Claudius was the first to renew the attempt ,  and conveyed over into the island some legions and auxiliaries ,  choosing Vespasian to share with him the campaign ,  whose approaching elevation had this beginning

 Namque absentia legati remoto metu Britanni agitare inter se mala servitutis , conferre iniurias et interpretando accendere$$ Relieved from apprehension by the legate's absence ,  the Britons dwelt much among themselves on the miseries of subjection ,  compared their wrongs ,  and exaggerated them in the discussion

 Multa proelia , et aliquando non incruenta magnamque Brigantum partem aut victoria amplexus est aut bello$$ There were many battles ,  some by no means bloodless ,  and his conquests ,  or at least his wars ,  embraced a large part of the territory of the Brigantes
 Et Cerialis quidem alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset$$ Indeed he would have altogether thrown into the shade the activity and renown of any other successor
 subiit sustinuitque molem Iulius Frontinus , vir magnus , quantum licebat , validamque et pugnacem Silurum gentem armis subegit , super virtutem hostium locorum quoque difficultates eluctatus$$ but Julius Frontinus was equal to the burden ,  a great man as far as greatness was then possible ,  who subdued by his arms the powerful and warlike tribe of the Silures ,  surmounting the difficulties of the country as well as the valour of the enemy
 Hunc Britanniae statum , has bellorum vices media iam aestate transgressus Agricola invenit , cum et milites velut omissa expeditione ad securitatem et hostes ad occasionem verterentur$$ Such was the state of Britain ,  and such were the vicissitudes of the war ,  which Agricola found on his crossing over about midsummer
 Ordovicum civitas haud multo ante adventum eius alam in finibus suis agentem prope universam obtriverat , eoque initio erecta provincia$$ Our soldiers made it a pretext for carlessness ,  as if all fighting was over ,  and the enemy were biding their time
 Et quibus bellum volentibus erat , probare exemplum ac recentis legati animum opperiri , cum Agricola , quamquam transvecta aestas , sparsi per provinciam numeri , praesumpta apud militem illius anni quies , tarda et contraria bellum incohaturo , et plerisque custodiri suspecta potius videbatur , ire obviam discrimini statuit$$ The Ordovices ,  shortly before Agricola's arrival ,  had destroyed nearly the whole of a squadron of allied cavalry quartered in their territory
 contractisque legionum vexillis et modica auxiliorum manu , quia in aequum degredi Ordovices non audebant , ipse ante agmen , quo ceteris par animus simili periculo esset , erexit aciem$$ Such a beginning raised the hopes of the country ,  and all who wished for war approved the precedent ,  and anxiously watched the temper of the new governor
 Caesaque prope universa gente , non ignarus instandum famae ac , prout prima cessissent , terrorem ceteris fore , Monam insulam , cuius possessione revocatum Paulinum rebellione totius Britanniae supra memoravi , redigere in potestatem animo intendit Sed , ut in subitis consiliis , naves deerant ratio et constantia ducis transvexit Depositis omnibus sarcinis lectissimos auxiliarium , quibus nota vada et patrius nandi usus , quo simul seque et arma et equos regunt , ita repente inmisit , ut obstupefacti hostes , qui classem , qui navis , qui mare expectabant , nihil arduum aut invictum crediderint sic ad bellum venientibus$$ Meanwhile Agricola ,  though summer was past and the detachments were scattered throughout the province ,  though the soldiers' confident anticipation of inaction for that year would be a source of delay and difficulty in beginning a campaign ,  and most advisers thought it best simply to watch all weak points ,  resolved to face the peril
 Ita petita pace ac dedita insula clarus ac magnus haberi Agricola , quippe cui ingredienti provinciam , quod tempus alii per ostentationem et officiorum ambitum transigunt , labor et periculum placuisset Nec Agricola prosperitate rerum in vanitatem usus , expeditionem aut victoriam vocabat victos continuisse ne laureatis quidem gesta prosecutus est , sed ipsa dissimulatione famae famam auxit , aestimantibus quanta futuri spe tam magna tacuisset$$ He collected a force of veterans and a small body of auxiliaries then as the Ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain ,  he put himself in front of the ranks to inspire all with the same courage against a common danger ,  and led his troops up a hill
 Ceterum animorum provinciae prudens , simulque doctus per aliena experimenta parum profici armis , si iniuriae sequerentur , causas bellorum statuit excidere$$ Next ,  with thorough insight into the feelings of his province ,  and taught also ,  by the experience of others ,  that little is gained by conquest if followed by oppression ,  he determined to root out the causes of war
 A se suisque orsus primum domum suam coercuit , quod plerisque haud minus arduum est quam provinciam regere$$ Beginning first with himself and his dependants ,  he kept his household under restraint ,  a thing as hard to many as ruling a province
 Nihil per libertos servosque publicae rei , non studiis privatis nec ex commendatione aut precibus centurionem militesve adscire , sed optimum quemque fidissimum putare$$ He transacted no public business through freedmen or slaves no private leanings ,  no recommendations or entreaties of friends ,  moved him in the selection of centurions and soldiers ,  but it was ever the best man whom he thought most trustworthy
 Omnia scire , non omnia exsequi$$ He knew everything ,  but did not always act on his knowledge
 Parvis peccatis veniam , magnis severitatem commodare$$ Trifling errors he treated with leniency ,  serious offences with severity
 nec poena semper , sed saepius paenitentia contentus esse$$ Nor was it always punishment ,  but far oftener penitence ,  which satisfied him
 officiis et administrationibus potius non peccaturos praeponere , quam damnare cum peccassent$$ He preferred to give office and power to men who would not transgress ,  rather than have to condemn a transgressor
 Frumenti et tributorum exactionem aequalitate munerum mollire , circumcisis quae in quaestum reperta ipso tributo gravius tolerabantur$$ He lightened the exaction of corn and tribute by an equal distribution of the burden ,  while he got rid of those contrivances for gain which were more intolerable than the tribute itself
 Namque per ludibrium adsidere clausis horreis et emere ultro frumenta ac luere pretio cogebantur$$ Hitherto the people had been compelled to endure the farce of waiting by the closed granary and of purchasing corn unnecessarily and raising it to a fictitious price
 Divortia itinerum et longinquitas regionum indicebatur , ut civitates proximis hibernis in remota et avia deferrent , donec quod omnibus in promptu erat paucis lucrosum fieret$$ Difficult by-roads and distant places were fixed for them ,  so that states with a winter-camp close to them had to carry corn to remote and inaccessible parts of the country ,  until what was within the reach of all became a source of profit to the few
 Tertius expeditionum annus novas gentis aperuit , vastatis usque ad Tanaum (aestuario nomen est) nationibus Qua formdine territi hostes quamquam conflictatum saevis tempestatibus exercitum lacessere non ausi$$ The third year of his campaigns opened up new tribes ,  our ravages on the native population being carried as far as the Taus ,  an estuary so called
 ponendisque insuper castellis spatium fuit Adnotabant periti non alium ducem opportunitates locorum sapientius legisse$$ This struck such terror into the enemy that he did not dare to attack our army ,  harassed though it was by violent storms
 Nullum ab Agricola positum castellum aut vi hostium expugnatum aut pactione ac fuga desertum$$ and there was even time for the erection of forts
 nam adversus moras obsidionis annuis copiis firmabantur Ita intrepida ibi hiems , crebrae eruptiones et sibi quisque praesidio , inritis hostibus eoque desperantibus , quia soliti plerumque damna aestatis hibernis eventibus pensare tum aestate atque hieme iuxta pellebantur$$ It was noted by experienced officers that no general had ever shown more judgment in choosing suitable positions ,  and that not a single fort established by Agricola was either stormed by the enemy or abandoned by capitulation or flight
 Nec Agricola umquam per alios gesta avidus intercepit$$ Sorties were continually made
 seu centurio seu praefectus incorruptum facti testem habebat$$ for these positions were secured from protracted siege by a year's supply
 Apud quosdam acerbior in conviciis narrabatur et ut erat comis bonis , ita adversus malos iniucundus Ceterum ex iracundia nihil supererat secretum , ut silentium eius non timeres honestius putabat offendere quam odisse$$ So winter brought with it no alarms ,  and each garrison could hold its own ,  as the baffled and despairing enemy ,  who had been accustomed often to repair his summer losses by winter successes ,  found himself repelled alike both in summer and winter
 Quinto expeditionum anno nave prima transgressus ignotas ad id tempus gentis crebris simul ac prosperis proeliis domuit$$ In the fifth year of the war Agricola ,  himself in the leading ship ,  crossed the Clota ,  and subdued in a series of victories tribes hitherto unknown
 eamque partem Britanniae quae Hiberniam aspicit copiis instruxit , in spem magis quam ob formidinem , si quidem Hibernia medio inter Britanniam atque Hispaniam sita et Gallico quoque mari opportuna valentissimam imperii partem magnis in vicem usibus miscuerit$$ In that part of Britain which looks towards Ireland ,  he posted some troops ,  hoping for fresh conquests rather than fearing attack ,  inasmuch as Ireland ,  being between Britain and Spain and conveniently situated for the seas round Gaul ,  might have been the means of connecting with great mutual benefit the most powerful parts of the empire
 Spatium eius , si Britanniae comparetur , angustius nostri maris insulas superat$$ Its extent is small when compared with Britain ,  but exceeds the islands of our seas
 Solum caelumque et ingenia cultusque hominum haud multum a Britannia differunt$$ In soil and climate ,  in the disposition ,  temper ,  and habits of its population ,  it differs but little from Britain
 in melius aditus portusque per commercia et negotiatores cogniti$$ We know most of its harbours and approaches ,  and that through the intercourse of commerce
 Agricola expulsum seditione domestica unum ex regulis gentis exceperat ac specie amicitiae in occasionem retinebat$$ One of the petty kings of the nation ,  driven out by internal faction ,  had been received by Agricola ,  who detained him under the semblance of friendship till he could make use of him
 Saepe ex eo audivi legione una et modicis auxiliis debellari obtinerique Hiberniam posse idque etiam adversus Britanniam profuturum , si Romana ubique arma et velut e conspectu libertas tolleretur$$ I have often heard him say that a single legion with a few auxiliaries could conquer and occupy Ireland ,  and that it would have a salutary effect on Britain for the Roman arms to be seen everywhere ,  and for freedom ,  so to speak ,  to be banished from its sight
 Ceterum aestate , qua sextum officii annum incohabat , amplexus civitates trans Bodotriam sitas , quia motus universarum ultra gentium et infesta hostilis exercitus itinera timebantur , portus classe exploravit quae ab Agricola primum adsumpta in partem virium sequebatur egregia specie , cum simul terra , simul mari bellum impelleretur , ac saepe isdem castris pedes equesque et nauticus miles mixti copiis et laetitia sua quisque facta , suos casus attollerent , ac modo silvarum ac montium profunda , modo tempestatum ac fluctuum adversa , hinc terra et hostis , hinc victus Oceanus militari iactantia compararentur$$ In the summer in which he entered on the sixth year of his office ,  his operations embraced the states beyond Bodotria ,  and ,  as he dreaded a general movement among the remoter tribes ,  as well as the perils which would beset an invading army ,  he explored the harbours with a fleet ,  which ,  at first employed by him as an integral part of his force ,  continued to accompany him The spectacle of war thus pushed on at once by sea and land was imposing while often infantry ,  cavalry ,  and marines ,  mingled in the same encampment and joyously sharing the same meals ,  would dwell on their own achievements and adventures ,  comparing ,  with a soldier's boastfulness ,  at one time the deep recesses of the forest and the mountain with the dangers of waves and storms ,  or ,  at another ,  battles by land with victories over the ocean
 Britannos quoque , ut ex captivis audiebatur , visa classis obstupefaciebat , tamquam aperto maris sui secreto ultimum victis perfugium clauderetur$$ The Britons too ,  as we learnt from the prisoners ,  were confounded by the sight of a fleet ,  as if ,  now that their inmost seas were penetrated ,  the conquered had their last refuge closed against them
 Ad manus et arma conversi Caledoniam incolentes populi magno paratu , maiore fama , uti mos est de ignotis , oppugnare ultro castellum adorti , metum ut provocantes addiderant$$ The tribes inhabiting Caledonia flew to arms ,  and with great preparations ,  made greater by the rumours which always exaggerate the unknown ,  themselves advanced to attack our fortresses ,  and thus ,  challenging a conflict ,  inspired us with alarm
 regrediendumque citra Bodotriam et cedendum potius quam pellerentur ignavi specie prudentium admonebant , cum interim cognoscit hostis pluribus agminibus inrupturos$$ To retreat south of the Bodotria ,  and to retire rather than to be driven out ,  was the advice of timid pretenders to prudence ,  when Agricola learnt that the enemy's attack would be made with more than one army
 Ac ne superante numero et peritia locorum circumiretur , diviso et ipso in tris partes exercitu incessit$$ Fearing that their superior numbers and their knowledge of the country might enable them to hem him in ,  he too distributed his forces into three divisions ,  and so advanced
 Quod ubi cognitum hosti , mutato repente consilio universi nonam legionem ut maxime invalidam nocte adgressi , inter somnum ac trepidationem caesis vigilibus inrupere$$ This becoming known to the enemy ,  they suddenly changed their plan ,  and with their whole force attacked by night the ninth Legion ,  as being the weakest ,  and cutting down the sentries ,  who were asleep or panic-stricken ,  they broke into the camp
 Iamque in ipsis castris pugnabatur , cum Agricola iter hostium ab exploratoribus edoctus et vestigiis insecutus , velocissimos equitum peditumque adsultare tergis pugnantium iubet , mox ab universis adici clamorem$$ And now the battle was raging within the camp itself ,  when Agricola ,  who had learnt from his scouts the enemy's line of march and had kept close on his track ,  ordered the most active soldiers of his cavalry and infantry to attack the rear of the assailants ,  while the entire army were shortly to raise a shout
 et propinqua luce fulsere signa$$ Soon his standards glittered in the light of daybreak
 Ita ancipiti malo territi Britanni$$ A double peril thus alarmed the Britons ,  while the courage of the Romans revived
 et nonanis rediit animus , ac securi pro salute de gloria certabant$$ and feeling sure of safety ,  they now fought for glory
 Ultro quin etiam erupere , et fuit atrox in ipsis portarum angustiis proelium , donec pulsi hostes , utroque exercitu certante , his , ut tulisse opem , illis , ne eguisse auxilio viderentur$$ In their turn they rushed to the attack ,  and there was a furious conflict within the narrow passages of the gates till the enemy were routed Both armies did their utmost ,  the one for the honour of having given aid ,  the other for that of not having needed support
 Quod nisi paludes et silvae fugientis texissent , debellatum illa victoria foret$$ Had not the flying enemy been sheltered by morasses and forests ,  this victory would have ended the war
 Cuius conscientia ac fama ferox exercitus nihil virtuti suae invium et penetrandam Caledoniam inveniendumque tandem Britanniae terminum continuo proeliorum cursu fremebant$$ Knowing this ,  and elated by their glory ,  our army exclaimed that nothing could resist their valour that they must penetrate the recesses of Caledonia ,  and at length after an unbroken succession of battles ,  discover the furthest limits of Britain
 Atque illi modo cauti ac sapientes prompti post eventum ac magniloqui erant$$ Those who but now were cautious and prudent ,  became after the event eager and boastful
 Iniquissima haec bellorum condicio est prospera omnes sibi vindicant , adversa uni imputantur$$ It is the singularly unfair peculiarity of war that the credit of success is claimed by all ,  while a disaster is attributed to one alone
 At Britanni non virtute se victos , sed occasione et arte ducis rati , nihil ex adrogantia remittere , quo minus iuventutem armarent , coniuges ac liberos in loca tuta transferrent , coetibus et sacrificiis conspirationem civitatum sancirent$$ But the Britons thinking themselves baffled ,  not so much by our valour as by our general's skilful use of an opportunity ,  abated nothing of their arrogant demeanour ,  arming their youth ,  removing their wives and children to a place of safety ,  and assembling together to ratify ,  with sacred rites ,  a confederacy of all their states
 Atque ita inritatis utrimque animis discessum$$ Thus ,  with angry feelings on both sides ,  the combatants parted
 Eadem aestate cohors Usiporum per Germanias conscripta et in Britanniam transmissa magnum ac memorabile facinus ausa est$$ The same summer a Usipian cohort ,  which had been levied in Germany and transported into Britain ,  ventured on a great and memorable exploit
 Occiso centurione ac militibus , qui ad tradendam disciplinam inmixti manipulis exemplum et rectores habebantur , tris liburnicas adactis per vim gubernatoribus ascendere$$ Having killed a centurion and some soldiers ,  who ,  to impart military discipline ,  had been incorporated with their ranks and were employed at once to instruct and command them ,  they embarked on board three swift galleys with pilots pressed into their service
 et uno remigante , suspectis duobus eoque interfectis , nondum vulgato rumore ut miraculum praevehebantur$$ Under the direction of one of them for two of the three they suspected and consequently put to death they sailed past the coast in the strangest way before any rumour about them was in circulation
 Mox ad aquam atque utilia raptum ubi adpulissent , cum plerisque Britannorum sua defensantium proelio congressi ac saepe victores , aliquando pulsi , eo ad extremum inopiae venere , ut infirmissimos suorum , mox sorte ductos vescerentur$$ After a while ,  dispersing in search of water and provisions ,  they encountered many of the Britons ,  who sought to defend their property Often victorious ,  though now and then beaten ,  they were at last reduced to such an extremity of want as to be compelled to eat ,  at first ,  the feeblest of their number ,  and then victims selected by lot
 Atque ita circumvecti Britanniam , amissis per inscitiam regendi navibus , pro praedonibus habiti , primum a Suebis , mox a Frisiis intercepti sunt$$ Having sailed round Britain and lost their vessels from not knowing how to manage them ,  they were looked upon as pirates and were intercepted ,  first by the Suevi and then by the Frisii
 Ac fuere quos per commercia venumdatos et in nostram usque ripam mutatione ementium adductos indicium tanti casus inlustravit$$ Some who were sold as slaves in the way of trade ,  and were brought through the process of barter as far as our side of the Rhine ,  gained notoriety by the disclosure of this extraordinary adventure
 Initio aestatis Agricola domestico vulnere ictus , anno ante natum filium amisit Quem casum neque ut plerique fortium virorum ambitiose , neque per lamenta rursus ac maerorem muliebriter tulit , et in luctu bellum inter remedia erat$$ Early in the summer Agricola sustained a domestic affliction in the loss of a son born a year before ,  a calamity which he endured ,  neither with the ostentatious fortitude displayed by many brave men ,  nor ,  on the other hand ,  with womanish tears and grief
 Igitur praemissa classe , quae pluribus locis praedata magnum et incertum terrorem faceret , expedito exercitu , cui ex Britannis fortissimos et longa pace exploratos addiderat , ad montem Graupium pervenit , quem iam hostis insederat$$ In his sorrow he found one source of relief in war Having sent on a fleet ,  which by its ravages at various points might cause a vague and wide-spread alarm ,  he advanced with a lightly equipped force ,  including in its ranks some Britons of remarkable bravery ,  whose fidelity had been tried through years of peace ,  as far as the Grampian mountains ,  which the enemy had already occupied
 Nam Britanni nihil fracti pugnae prioris eventu et ultionem aut servitium expectantes , tandemque docti commune periculum concordia propulsandum , legationibus et foederibus omnium civitatium vires exciverant$$ For the Britons ,  indeed ,  in no way cowed by the result of the late engagement ,  had made up their minds to be either avenged or enslaved ,  and convinced at length that a common danger must be averted by union ,  had ,  by embassies and treaties ,  summoned forth the whole strength of all their states
 Iamque super triginta milia armatorum aspiciebantur , et adhuc adfluebat omnis iuventus et quibus cruda ac viridis senectus , clari bello et sua quisque decora gestantes , cum inter pluris duces virtute et genere praestans nomine Calgacus apud contractam multitudinem proelium poscentem in hunc modum locutus fertur$$ More than 30 , 000 armed men were now to be seen ,  and still there were pressing in all the youth of the country ,  with all whose old age was yet hale and vigorous ,  men renowned in war and bearing each decorations of his own Meanwhile ,  among the many leaders ,  one superior to the rest in valour and in birth ,  Galgacus by name ,  is said to have thus harangued the multitude gathered around him and clamouring for battle 
 Quotiens causas belli et necessitatem nostram intueor , magnus mihi animus est hodiernum diem consensumque vestrum initium libertatis toti Britanniae fore$$ Whenever I consider the origin of this war and the necessities of our position ,  I have a sure confidence that this day ,  and this union of yours ,  will be the beginning of freedom to the whole of Britain
 nam et universi coistis et servitutis expertes , et nullae ultra terrae ac ne mare quidem securum inminente nobis classe Romana$$ To all of us slavery is a thing unknown there are no lands beyond us ,  and even the sea is not safe ,  menaced as we are by a Roman fleet
 Ita proelium atque arma , quae fortibus honesta , eadem etiam ignavis tutissima sunt$$ And thus in war and battle ,  in which the brave find glory ,  even the coward will find safety
 Priores pugnae , quibus adversus Romanos varia fortuna certatum est , spem ac subsidium in nostris manibus habebant , quia nobilissimi totius Britanniae eoque in ipsis penetralibus siti nec ulla servientium litora aspicientes , oculos quoque a contactu dominationis inviolatos habebamus Nos terrarum ac libertatis extremos recessus ipse ac sinus famae in hunc diem defendit$$ Former contests ,  in which ,  with varying fortune ,  the Romans were resisted ,  still left in us a last hope of succour ,  inasmuch as being the most renowned nation of Britain ,  dwelling in the very heart of the country ,  and out of sight of the shores of the conquered ,  we could keep even our eyes unpolluted by the contagion of slavery To us who dwell on the uttermost confines of the earth and of freedom ,  this remote sanctuary of Britain's glory has up to this time been a defence
 nunc terminus Britanniae patet , atque omne ignotum pro magnifico est$$ Now ,  however ,  the furthest limits of Britain are thrown open ,  and the unknown always passes for the marvellous
 sed nulla iam ultra gens , nihil nisi fluctus ac saxa , et infestiores Romani , quorum superbiam frustra per obsequium ac modestiam effugias$$ But there are no tribes beyond us ,  nothing indeed but waves and rocks ,  and the yet more terrible Romans ,  from whose oppression escape is vainly sought by obedience and submission
 Raptores orbis , postquam cuncta vastantibus defuere terrae , mare scrutantur$$ Robbers of the world ,  having by their universal plunder exhausted the land ,  they rifle the deep
 si locuples hostis est , avari , si pauper , ambitiosi , quos non Oriens , non Occidens satiaverit$$ If the enemy be rich ,  they are rapacious if he be poor ,  they lust for dominion
 soli omnium opes atque inopiam pari adfectu concupiscunt$$ neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them
 Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium , atque ubi solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant$$ Alone among men they covet with equal eagerness poverty and riches
 An eandem Romanis in bello virtutem quam in pace lasciviam adesse creditis$$ Do you suppose that the Romans will be as brave in war as they are licentious in peace
 Nostris illi dissensionibus ac discordiis clari vitia hostium in gloriam exercitus sui vertunt quem contractum ex diversissimis gentibus ut secundae res tenent , ita adversae dissolvent$$ To our strifes and discords they owe their fame ,  and they turn the errors of an enemy to the renown of their own army ,  an army which ,  composed as it is of every variety of nations ,  is held together by success and will be broken up by disaster
 nisi si Gallos et Germanos et (pudet dictu) Britannorum plerosque , licet dominationi alienae sanguinem commodent , diutius tamen hostis quam servos , fide et adfectu teneri putatis$$ These Gauls and Germans ,  and ,  I blush to say ,  these numerous Britons ,  who ,  though they lend their lives to support a stranger's rule ,  have been its enemies longer than its subjects ,  you cannot imagine to be bound by fidelity and affection
 Metus ac terror sunt infirma vincla caritatis$$ Fear and terror there certainly are ,  feeble bonds of attachment
 quae ubi removeris , qui timere desierint , odisse incipient$$ remove them ,  and those who have ceased to fear will begin to hate
 Omnia victoriae incitamenta pro nobis sunt$$ All the incentives to victory are on our side
 nullae Romanos coniuges accendunt , nulli parentes fugam exprobraturi sunt$$ The Romans have no wives to kindle their courage
 aut nulla plerisque patria aut alia est$$ no parents to taunt them with flight
 Paucos numero , trepidos ignorantia , caelum ipsum ac mare et silvas , ignota omnia circumspectantis , clausos quodam modo ac vinctos di nobis tradiderunt$$ many have either no country or one far away Few in number ,  dismayed by their ignorance ,  looking around upon a sky ,  a sea ,  and forests which are all unfamiliar to them
 Ne terreat vanus aspectus et auri fulgor atque argenti , quod neque tegit neque vulnerat$$ hemmed in ,  as it were ,  and enmeshed ,  the Gods have delivered them into our hands
 In ipsa hostium acie inveniemus nostras manus$$ Be not frightened by idle display ,  by the glitter of gold and of silver ,  which can neither protect nor wound
 adgnoscent Britanni suam causam , recordabuntur Galli priorem libertatem , tam deserent illos ceteri Germani quam nuper Usipi reliquerunt$$ In the very ranks of the enemy we shall find our own forces Britons will acknowledge their own cause
 Nec quicquam ultra formidinis$$ Gauls will remember past freedom
 vacua castella , senum coloniae , inter male parentis et iniuste imperantis aegra municipia et discordantia$$ the other Germans will abandon them ,  as but lately did the Usipii
 Hic dux , hic exercitus$$ Behind them there is nothing to dread
 ibi tributa et metalla et ceterae servientium poenae , quas in aeternum perferre aut statim ulcisci in hoc campo est$$ The forts are ungarrisoned the colonies in the hands of aged men
 Proinde ituri in aciem et maiores vestros et posteros cogitate$$ what with disloyal subjects and oppressive rulers ,  the towns are ill-affected and rife with discord
 Excepere orationem alacres , ut barbaris moris , fremitu cantuque et clamoribus dissonis Iamque agmina et armorum fulgores audentissimi cuiusque procursu simul instruebatur acies , cum Agricola quamquam laetum et vix munimentis coercitum militem accendendum adhuc ratus , ita disseruit septimus annus est , commilitones , ex quo virtute et auspiciis imperii Romani , fide atque opera vestra Britanniam vicistis$$ They received his speech with enthusiasm ,  and as is usual among barbarians ,  with songs ,  shouts and discordant cries
 Tot expeditionibus , tot proeliis , seu fortitudine adversus hostis seu patientia ac labore paene adversus ipsam rerum naturam opus fuit , neque me militum neque vos ducis paenituit Ergo egressi , ego veterum legatorum , vos priorum exercituum terminos , finem Britanniae non fama nec rumore , sed castris et armis tenemus inventa Britannia et subacta Equidem saepe in agmine , cum vos paludes montesve et flumina fatigarent , fortissimi cuiusque voces audiebam quando dabitur hostis , quando in manus veniet Veniunt , e latebris suis extrusi , et vota virtusque in aperto , omniaque prona victoribus atque eadem victis adversa Nam ut superasse tantum itineris , evasisse silvas , transisse aestuaria pulchrum ac decorum in frontem , ita fugientibus periculosissima quae hodie prosperrima sunt neque enim nobis aut locorum eadem notitia aut commeatuum eadem abundantia , sed manus et arma et in his omnia Quod ad me attinet , iam pridem mihi decretum est neque exercitus neque ducis terga tuta esse Proinde et honesta mors turpi vita potior , et incolumitas ac decus eodem loco sita sunt$$ And now was seen the assembling of troops and the gleam of arms ,  as the boldest warriors stepped to the fro ,  As the line was forming ,  Agricola ,  who ,  though his troop were in high spirits and could scarcely be kept within the entrenchments ,  still thought it right to encourage them ,  spoke as follows 
 Si novae gentes atque ignota acies constitisset , aliorum exercituum exemplis vos hortarer$$ If unknown nations and an untried enemy confronted you ,  I should urge you on by the example of other armies
 nunc vestra decora recensete , vestros oculos interrogate$$ As it is ,  look back upon your former honours ,  question your own eyes
 Hi sunt , quos proximo anno unam legionem furto noctis adgressos clamore debellastis$$ These are the men who last year under cover of darkness attacked a single legion ,  whom you routed by a shout
 hi ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi ideoque tam diu superstites$$ Of all the Britons these are the most confirmed runaways ,  and this is why they have survived so long
 Quo modo silvas saltusque penetrantibus fortissimum quodque animal contra ruere , pavida et inertia ipso agminis sono pellebantur , sic acerrimi Britannorum iam pridem ceciderunt , reliquus est numerus ignavorum et metuentium$$ Just a when the huntsman penetrates the forest and the thicket ,  all the most courageous animals rush out upon him ,  while the timid and feeble are scared away by the very sound of his approach ,  so the bravest of the Britons have long since fallen
 Quos quod tandem invenistis , non restiterunt , sed deprehensi sunt$$ and the rest are a mere crowd of spiritless cowards
 novissimae res et extremus metus torpore defixere aciem in his vestigiis , in quibus pulchram et spectabilem victoriam ederetis$$ You have at last found them ,  not because they have stood their ground ,  but because they have been overtaken
 Transigite cum expeditionibus , imponite quinquaginta annis magnum diem , adprobate rei publicae numquam exercitui imputari potuisse aut moras belli aut causas rebellandi$$ Their desperate plight ,  and the extreme terror that paralyses them ,  have rivetted their line to this spot ,  that you might achieve in it a splendid and memorable victory
 Et adloquente adhuc Agricola militum ardor eminebat , et finem orationis ingens alacritas consecuta est , statimque ad arma discursum$$ While Agricola was yet speaking ,  the ardour of the soldiers was rising to its height ,  and the close of his speech was followed by a great outburst of enthusiasm
 Instinctos ruentisque ita disposuit , ut peditum auxilia , quae octo milium erant , mediam aciem firmarent , equitum tria milia cornibus adfunderentur$$ In a moment they flew to arms He arrayed his eager and impetuous troops in such a manner that the auxiliary infantry ,  8 , 000 in number ,  strengthened his centre ,  while 3 , 000 cavalry were posted on his wings
 Legiones pro vallo stetere , ingens victoriae decus citra Romanum sanguinem bellandi , et auxilium , si pellerentur$$ The legions were drawn up in front of the intrenched camp his victory would be vastly more glorious if won without the loss of Roman blood ,  and he would have a reserve in case of repulse
 Britannorum acies in speciem simul ac terrorem editioribus locis constiterat ita , ut primum agmen in aequo , ceteri per adclive iugum conexi velut insurgerent$$ The enemy ,  to make a formidable display ,  had posted himself on high ground his van was on the plain ,  while the rest of his army rose in an arch-like form up the slope of a hill
 media campi covinnarius eques strepitu ac discursu complebat$$ The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry
 Tum Agricola superante hostium multitudine veritus , ne in frontem simul et latera suorum pugnaretur , diductis ordinibus , quamquam porrectior acies futura erat et arcessendas plerique legiones admonebant , promptior in spem et firmus adversis , dimisso equo pedes ante vexilla constitit$$ Agricola ,  fearing that from the enemy's superiority of force he would be simultaneously attacked in front and on the flanks ,  widened his ranks ,  and though his line was likely to be too extended ,  and several officers advised him to bring up the legions ,  yet ,  so sanguine was he ,  so resolute in meeting danger ,  he sent away his horse and took his stand on foot before the colours
 Ac primo congressu eminus certabatur$$ The action began with distant fighting
 simulque constantia , simul arte Britanni ingentibus gladiis et brevibus caetris missilia nostrorum vitare vel excutere , atque ipsi magnam vim telorum superfundere , donec Agricola quattuor Batavorum cohortis ac Tungrorum duas cohortatus est , ut rem ad mucrones ac manus adducerent$$ The Britons with equal steadiness and skill used their huge swords and small shields to avoid or to parry the missiles of our soldiers ,  while they themselves poured on us a dense shower of darts ,  till Agricola encouraged three Batavian and two Tungrian cohorts to bring matters to the decision of close fighting with swords
 quod et ipsis vetustate militiae exercitatum et hostibus inhabile parva scuta et enormis gladios gerentibus$$ Such tactics were familiar to these veteran soldiers ,  but were embarrassing to an enemy armed with small bucklers and unwieldy weapons
 nam Britannorum gladii sine mucrone complexum armorum et in arto pugnam non tolerabant$$ The swords of the Britons are not pointed ,  and do not allow them to close with the foe ,  or to fight in the open field
 Igitur ut Batavi miscere ictus , ferire umbonibus , ora fodere , et stratis qui in aequo adstiterant , erigere in collis aciem coepere , ceterae cohortes aemulatione et impetu conisae proximos quosque caedere$$ No sooner did the Batavians begin to close with the enemy ,  to strike them with their shields ,  to disfigure their faces ,  and overthrowing the force on the plain to advance their line up the hill ,  than the other auxiliary cohorts joined with eager rivalry in cutting down all the nearest of the foe
 ac plerique semineces aut integri festinatione victoriae relinquebantur$$ Many were left behind half dead ,  some even unwounded ,  in the hurry of victory
 Interim equitum turmae , ut fugere covinnarii , peditum se proelio miscuere$$ Meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled ,  and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry
 Et quamquam recentem terrorem intulerant , densis tamen hostium agminibus et inaequalibus locis haerebant$$ But although these at first spread panic ,  they were soon impeded by the close array of our ranks and by the inequalities of the ground
 minimeque aequa nostris iam pugnae facies erat , cum aegre clivo instantes simul equorum corporibus impellerentur ac saepe vagi currus , exterriti sine rectoribus equi , ut quemque formido tulerat , transversos aut obvios incursabant$$ The battle had anything but the appearance of a cavalry action ,  for men and horses were carried along in confusion together ,  while chariots ,  destitute of guidance ,  and terrified horses without drivers ,  dashed as panic urged them ,  sideways ,  or in direct collision against the ranks
 Et Britanni , qui adhuc pugnae expertes summa collium insederant et paucitatem nostrorum vacui spernebant , degredi paulatim et circumire terga vincentium coeperant , ni id ipsum veritus Agricola quattuor equitum alas , ad subita belli retentas , venientibus opposuisset , quantoque ferocius adcucurrerant , tanto acrius pulsos in fugam disiecisset$$ Those of the Britons who ,  having as yet taken no part in the engagement ,  occupied the hill-tops ,  and who without fear for themselves sat idly disdaining the smallness of our numbers ,  had begun gradually to descend and to hem in the rear of the victorious army ,  when Agricola ,  who feared this very movement ,  opposed their advance with four squadrons of cavalry held in reserve by him for any sudden emergencies of battle
 Ita consilium Britannorum in ipsos versum , transvectaeque praecepto ducis a fronte pugnantium alae aversam hostium aciem invasere$$ Their repulse and rout was as severe as their onset had been furious Thus the enemy's design recoiled on himself ,  and the cavalry which by the general's order had wheeled round from the van of the contending armies ,  attacked his rear
 Tum vero patentibus locis grande et atrox spectaculum$$ Then ,  indeed ,  the open plain presented an awful and hideous spectacle
 sequi , vulnerare , capere , atque eosdem oblatis aliis trucidare$$ Our men pursued ,  wounded ,  made prisoners of the fugitives only to slaughter them when others fell in their way
 Iam hostium , prout cuique ingenium erat , catervae armatorum paucioribus terga praestare , quidam inermes ultro ruere ac se morti offerre$$ And now the enemy ,  as prompted by their various dispositions ,  fled in whole battalions with arms in their hands before a few pursuers ,  while some ,  who were unarmed ,  actually rushed to the front and gave themselves up to death
 Passim arma et corpora et laceri artus et cruenta humus$$ Everywhere there lay scattered arms ,  corpses ,  and mangled limbs ,  and the earth reeked with blood
 et aliquando etiam victis ira virtusque$$ Even the conquered now and then felt a touch of fury and of courage
 Nam postquam silvis adpropinquaverunt , primos sequentium incautos collecti et locorum gnari circumveniebant$$ On approaching the woods ,  they rallied ,  and its they knew the ground ,  they were able to pounce on the foremost and least cautious of the pursuers
 Quod ni frequens ubique Agricola validas et expeditas cohortis indaginis modo et , sicubi artiora erant , partem equitum dimissis equis , simul rariores silvas equitem persultare iussisset , acceptum aliquod vulnus per nimiam fiduciam foret$$ Had not Agricola ,  who was present everywhere ,  ordered a force of strong and lightly-equipped cohorts ,  with some dismounted troopers for the denser parts of the forest ,  and a detachment of cavalry where it was not so thick ,  to scour the woods like a party of huntsmen ,  serious loss would have been sustained through the excessive confidence of our troops
 Ceterum ubi compositos firmis ordinibus sequi rursus videre , in fugam versi , non agminibus , ut prius , nec alius alium respectantes$$ When ,  however ,  the enemy saw that we again pursued them in firm and compact array ,  they fled no longer in masses as before ,  each looking for his comrade
 rari e vitabundi in vicem longinqua atque avia petiere$$ but dispersing and avoiding one another ,  they sought the shelter of distant and pathless wilds
 Finis sequendi nox et satietas fuit$$ Night and weariness of bloodshed put an end to the pursuit
 Caesa hostium ad decem milia$$ About 10 , 000 of the enemy were slain
 nostrorum trecenti sexaginta cecidere , in quis Aulus Atticus praefectus cohortis , iuvenili ardore et ferocia equi hostibus inlatus$$ on our side there fell 360 men ,  and among them Aulus Atticus ,  the commander of the cohort ,  whose youthful impetuosity and mettlesome steed had borne him into the midst of the enemy
 Et nox quidem gaudio praedaque laeta victoribus$$ Elated by their victory and their booty ,  the conquerors passed a night of merriment
 Britanni palantes mixto virorum mulierumque ploratu trahere vulneratos , vocare integros , deserere domos ac per iram ultro incendere , eligere latebras et statim relinquere$$ Meanwhile the Britons ,  wandering amidst the mingled wailings of men and women ,  were dragging off their wounded ,  calling to the unhurt ,  deserting their homes ,  and in their rage actually firing them ,  choosing places of concealment only instantly to abandon them
 miscere in vicem consilia aliqua , dein separare aliquando frangi aspectu pignorum suorum , saepius concitari$$ One moment they would take counsel together ,  the next ,  part company ,  while the sight of those who were dearest to them sometimes melted their hearts ,  but oftener roused their fury
 Satisque constabat saevisse quosdam in coniuges ac liberos , tamquam misererentur$$ It was an undoubted fact that some of them vented their rage on their wives and children ,  as if in pity for their lot
 Proximus dies faciem victoriae latius aperuit$$ The following day showed more fully the extent of the calamity ,  for the silence of desolation reigned everywhere 
 vastum ubique silentium , secreti colles , fumantia procul tecta , nemo exploratoribus obvius$$  the hills were forsaken ,  houses were smoking in the distance ,  and no one was seen by the scouts
 Quibus in omnem partem dimissis , ubi incerta fugae vestigia neque usquam conglobari hostis compertum (et exacta iam aestate spargi bellum nequibat) , in finis Borestorum exercitum deducit$$ These were despatched in all directions and it having been ascertained that the track of the flying enemy was uncertain ,  and that there was no attempt at rallying ,  it being also impossible ,  as summer was now over ,  to extend the war ,  Agricola led back his army into the territory of the Boresti
 Ibi acceptis obsidibus , praefecto classis circumvehi Britanniam praecipit$$ He received hostages from them ,  and then ordered the commander of the fleet to sail round Britain
 Datae ad id vires , et praecesserat terror$$ A force for this purpose was given him ,  which great panic everywhere preceded
 Ipse peditem atque equites lento itinere , quo novarum gentium animi ipsa transitus mora terrerentur , in hibernis locavit Et simul classis secunda tempestate ac fama Trucculensem portum tenuit , unde proximo Britanniae latere praelecto omni redierat$$ Agricola himself ,  leading his infantry and cavalry by slow marches ,  so as to overawe the newly-conquered tribes by the very tardiness of his progress ,  brought them into winter-quarters ,  while the fleet with propitious breezes and great renown entered the harbour of Trutulium ,  to which it had returned after having coasted along the entire southern shore of the island
 Hunc rerum cursum , quamquam nulla verborum iactantia epistulis Agricolae auctum , ut erat Domitiano moris , fronte laetus , pectore anxius excepit$$ Of this series of events ,  though not exaggerated in the despatches of Agricola by any boastfulness of language ,  Domitian heard ,  as was his wont ,  with joy in his face but anxiety in his heart
 Inerat conscientia derisui fuisse nuper falsum e Germania triumphum , emptis per commercia , quorum habitus et crinis in captivorum speciem formarentur at nunc veram magnamque victoriam tot milibus hostium caesis ingenti fama celebrari$$ He felt conscious that all men laughed at his late mock triumph over Germany ,  for which there had been purchased from traders people whose dress and hair might be made to resemble those of captives ,  whereas now a real and splendid victory ,  with the destruction of thousands of the enemy ,  was being celebrated with just applause
 Id sibi maxime formidolosum , privati hominis nomen supra principem attolli$$ It was ,  he thought ,  a very alarming thing for him that the name of a subject should be raised above that of the Emperor
 frustra studia fori et civilium artium decus in silentium acta , si militarem gloriam alius occuparet$$ it was to no purpose that he had driven into obscurity the pursuit of forensic eloquence and the graceful accomplishments of civil life ,  if another were to forestall the distinctions of war
 cetera utcumque facilius dissimulari , ducis boni imperatoriam virtutem esse$$ To other glories he could more easily shut his eyes ,  but the greatness of a good general was a truly imperial quality
 Talibus curis exercitus , quodque saevae cogitationis indicium erat , secreto suo satiatus , optimum in praesentia statuit reponere odium , donec impetus famae et favor exercitus languesceret$$ Harassed by these anxieties ,  and absorbed in an incommunicable trouble ,  a sure prognostic of some cruel purpose ,  he decided that it was best for the present to suspend his hatred until the freshness of Agricola's renown and his popularity with the army should begin to pass away
 Igitur triumphalia ornamenta et inlustris statuae honorem et quidquid pro triumpho datur , multo verborum honore cumulata , decerni in senatu iubet addique insuper opinionem , Syriam provinciam Agricolae destinari , vacuam tum morte Atili Rufi consularis et maioribus reservatam Credidere plerique libertum ex secretioribus ministeriis missum ad Agricolam codicillos , quibus ei Syria dabatur , tulisse , cum eo praecepto ut , si in Britannia foret , traderentur eumque libertum in ipso freto Oceani obvium Agricolae , ne appellato quidem eo ad Domitianum remeasse , sive verum istud , sive ex ingenio principis fictum ac compositum est$$ For Agricola was still the governor of Britain Accordingly the Emperor ordered that the usual triumphal decorations ,  the honour of a laurelled statue ,  and all that is commonly given in place of the triumphal procession ,  with the addition of many laudatory expressions ,  should be decreed in the senate ,  together with a hint to the effect that Agricola was to have the province of Syria ,  then vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus ,  a man of consular rank ,  and generally reserved for men of distinction
 Tradiderat interim Agricola successori suo provinciam quietam tutamque Ac ne notabilis celebritate et frequentia occurrentium introitus esset , vitato amicorum officio noctu in urbem , noctu in Palatium , ita ut praeceptum erat , venit exceptusque brevi osculo et nullo sermone turbae servientium inmixtus est$$ It was believed by many persons that one of the freedmen employed on confidential services was sent to Agricola ,  bearing a despatch in which Syria was offered him ,  and with instructions to deliver it should he be in Britain
 Ceterum uti militare nomen , grave inter otiosos , aliis virtutibus temperaret , tranquillitatem atque otium penitus hausit , cultu modicus , sermone facilis , uno aut altero amicorum comitatus , adeo ut plerique , quibus magnos viros per ambitionem aestimare mos est , viso aspectoque Agricola quaererent famam , pauci interpretarentur$$ that this freedman in crossing the straits met Agricola ,  and without even saluting him made his way back to Domitian though I cannot say whether the story is true ,  or is only a fiction invented to suit the Emperor's character
 Aderat iam annus , quo proconsulatum Africae et Asiae sortiretur , et occiso Civica nuper nec Agricolae consilium deerat nec Domitiano exemplum$$ The year had now arrived in which the proconsulate of Asia or Africa was to fall to him by lot ,  and ,  as Civica had been lately murdered ,  Agricola did not want a warning ,  or Domitian a precedent
 Accessere quidam cogitationum principis periti , qui iturusne esset in provinciam ultro Agricolam interrogarent$$ Persons well acquainted with the Emperor's feelings came to ask Agricola ,  as if on their own account ,  whether he would go
 Ac primo occultius quietem et otium laudare , mox operam suam in adprobanda excusatione offerre , postremo non iam obscuri suadentes simul terrentesque pertraxere ad Domitianum$$ First they hinted their purpose by praises of tranquillity and leisure then offered their services in procuring acceptance for his excuses and at last ,  throwing off all disguise ,  brought him by entreaties and threats to Domitian
 Qui paratus simulatione , in adrogantiam compositus , et audiit preces excusantis , et , cum adnuisset , agi sibi gratias passus est , nec erubuit beneficii invidia$$ The Emperor ,  armed beforehand with hypocrisy ,  and assuming a haughty demeanour ,  listened to his prayer that he might be excused ,  and having granted his request allowed himself to be formally thanked ,  nor blushed to grant so sinister a favour
 Salarium tamen proconsulare solitum offerri et quibusdam a se ipso concessum Agricolae non dedit , sive offensus non petitum , sive ex conscientia , ne quod vetuerat videretur emisse$$ But the salary usually granted to a proconsul ,  and which he had himself given to some governors ,  he did not bestow on Agricola ,  either because he was offended at its not having been asked ,  or was warned by his conscience that he might be thought to have purchased the refusal which he had commanded
 Proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem laeseris$$ It is ,  indeed ,  human nature to hate the man whom you have injured
 Domitiani vero natura praeceps in iram , et quo obscurior , eo inrevocabilior , moderatione tamen prudentiaque Agricolae leniebatur , quia non contumacia neque inani iactatione libertatis famam fatumque provocabat$$ yet the Emperor ,  notwithstanding his irascible temper and an implacability proportioned to his reserve ,  was softened by the moderation and prudence of Agricola ,  who neither by a perverse obstinacy nor an idle parade of freedom challenged fame or provoked his fate
 Sciant , quibus moris est inlicita mirari , posse etiam sub malis principibus magnos viros esse , obsequiumque ac modestiam , si industria ac vigor adsint , eo laudis excedere , quo plerique per abrupta , sed in nullum rei publicae usum <nisi> ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt$$ Let it be known to those whose habit it is to admire the disregard of authority ,  that there may be great men even under bad emperors ,  and that obedience and submission ,  when joined to activity and vigour ,  may attain a glory which most men reach only by a perilous career ,  utterly useless to the state ,  and closed by an ostentatious death
 Finis vitae eius nobis luctuosus , amicis tristis , extraneis etiam ignotisque non sine cura fuit$$ The end of his life ,  a deplorable calamity to us and a grief to his friends ,  was regarded with concern even by strangers and those who knew him not
 vulgus quoque et hic aliud agens populus et ventitavere ad domum et per fora et circulos locuti sunt$$ The common people and this busy population continually inquired at his house ,  and talked of him in public places and in private gatherings
 nec quisquam audita morte Agricolae aut laetatus est aut statim oblitus$$ No man when he heard of Agricola's death could either be glad or at once forget it
 Augebat miserationem constans rumor veneno interceptum$$ Men's sympathy was increased by a prevalent rumour that he was destroyed by poison
 nobis nihil comperti , ut adfirmare ausim$$ For myself ,  I have nothing which I should venture to state for fact
 Ceterum per omnem valetudinem eius crebrius quam ex more principatus per nuntios visentis et libertorum primi et medicorum intimi venere , sive cura illud sive inquisitio erat$$ Certainly during the whole of his illness the Emperor's chief freedmen and confidential physicians came more frequently than is usual with a court which pays its visits by means of messengers
 Supremo quidem die momenta ipsa deficientis per dispositos cursores nuntiata constabat , nullo credente sic adcelerari quae tristis audiret$$ This was ,  perhaps ,  solicitude ,  perhaps espionage Certain it is ,  that on the last day the very agonies of his dying moments were reported by a succession of couriers ,  and no one believed that there would be such haste about tidings which would be heard with regret
 Speciem tamen doloris animi vultu prae se tulit , securus iam odii et qui facilius dissimularet gaudium quam metum$$ Yet in his manner and countenance the Emperor displayed some signs of sorrow ,  for he could now forget his enmity ,  and it was easier to conceal his joy than his fear
 Satis constabat lecto testamento Agricolae , quo coheredem optimae uxori et piissimae filiae Domitianum scripsit , laetatum eum velut honore iudicioque$$ It was well known that on reading the will ,  in which he was named co-heir with Agricola's excellent wife and most dutiful daughter ,  he expressed delight ,  as if it had been a complimentary choice
 Tam caeca et corrupta mens adsiduis adulationibus erat , ut nesciret a bono patre non scribi heredem nisi malum principem$$ So blinded and perverted was his mind by incessant flattery ,  that he did not know that it was only a bad Emperor whom a good father would make his heir
 Natus erat Agricola Gaio Caesare tertium consule idibus Iuniis$$ Agricola was born on the 13th of June ,  in the third consulate of Caius Cæsar
 excessit quarto et quinquagesimo anno , decimum kalendas Septembris Collega Prisc<in>oque consulibus$$ he died on the 23rd of August ,  during the consulate of Collega and Priscus ,  being in the fifty-sixth year of his age
 Quod si habitum quoque eius posteri noscere velint , decentior quam sublimior fuit$$ Should posterity wish to know something of his appearance ,  it was graceful rather than commanding
 nihil impetus in vultu$$ There was nothing formidable in his appearance
 gratia oris supererat$$ a gracious look predominated
 Bonum virum facile crederes , magnum libenter$$ One would easily believe him a good man ,  and willingly believe him to be great
 Et ipse quidem , quamquam medio in spatio integrae aetatis ereptus , quantum ad gloriam , longissimum aevum peregit$$ As for himself ,  though taken from us in the prime of a vigorous manhood ,  yet ,  as far as glory is concerned ,  his life was of the longest
 Quippe et vera bona , quae in virtutibus sita sunt , impleverat , et consulari ac triumphalibus ornamentis praedito quid aliud adstruere fortuna poterat$$ Those true blessings ,  indeed ,  which consist in virtue ,  he had fully attained and on one who had reached the honours of a consulate and a triumph ,  what more had fortune to bestow
 Opibus nimiis non gaudebat , speciosae non contigerant$$ Immense wealth had no attractions for him ,  and wealth he had ,  even to splendour
 Filia atque uxore superstitibus potest videri etiam beatus incolumi dignitate , florente fama , salvis adfinitatibus et amicitiis futura effugisse$$ As his daughter and his wife survived him ,  it may be thought that he was even fortunate fortunate ,  in that while his honours had suffered no eclipse ,  while his fame was at its height ,  while his kindred and his friends still prospered ,  he escaped from the evil to come
 Nam sicut ei non licuit durare in hanc beatissimi saeculi lucem ac principem Traianum videre , quod augurio votisque apud nostras auris ominabatur , ita festinatae mortis grande solacium tulit evasisse postremum illud tempus , quo Domitianus non iam per intervalla ac spiramenta temporum , sed continuo et velut uno ictu rem publicam exhausit$$ For ,  though to survive until the dawn of this most happy age and to see a Trajan on the throne was what he would speculate upon in previsions and wishes confided to my ears ,  yet he had this mighty compensation for his premature death ,  that he was spared those later years during which Domitian ,  leaving now no interval or breathing space of time ,  but ,  as it were ,  with one continuous blow ,  drained the life-blood of the Commonwealth
 Non vidit Agricola obsessam curiam et clausum armis senatum et eadem strage tot consularium caedes , tot nobilissimarum feminarum exilia et fugas Una adhuc victoria Carus Mettius censebatur , et intra Albanam arcem sententia Messalini strepebat , et Massa Baebius iam tum reus erat$$ Agricola did not see the senate-house besieged ,  or the senate hemmed in by armed men ,  or so many of our consulars falling at one single massacre ,  or so many of Rome's noblest ladies exiles and fugitives
 mox nostrae duxere Helvidium in carcerem manus nos Maurici Rusticique visus foedavit nos innocenti sanguine Senecio perfudit Nero tamen subtraxit oculos suos iussitque scelera , non spectavit praecipua sub Domitiano miseriarum pars erat videre et aspici , cum suspiria nostra subscriberentur , cum denotandis tot hominum palloribus sufficeret saevus ille vultus et rubor , quo se contra pudorem muniebat Tu vero felix , Agricola , non vitae tantum claritate , sed etiam opportunitate mortis Ut perhibent qui interfuere novissimis sermonibus tuis , constans et libens fatum excepisti , tamquam pro virili portione innocentiam principi donares$$ Carus Metius had as yet the distinction of but one victory ,  and the noisy counsels of Messalinus were not heard beyond the walls of Alba ,  and Massa Bæbius was then answering for his life It was not long before our hands dragged Helvidius to prison ,  before we gazed on the dying looks of Manricus and Rusticus ,  before we were steeped in Senecio's innocent blood
 Sed mihi filiaeque eius praeter acerbitatem parentis erepti auget maestitiam , quod adsidere valetudini , fovere deficientem , satiari vultu complexuque non contigit$$ Even Nero turned his eyes away ,  and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered
 Excepissemus certe mandata vocesque , quas penitus animo figeremus Noster hic dolor , nostrum vulnus , nobis tam longae absentiae condicione ante quadriennium amissus est Omnia sine dubio , optime parentum , adsidente amantissima uxore superfuere honori tuo paucioribus tamen lacrimis comploratus es , et novissima in luce desideravere aliquid oculi tui$$ with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen ,  to know that our sighs were being recorded ,  to have ,  ever ready to note the pallid looks of so many faces ,  that savage countenance reddened with the hue with which he defied shame
 Si quis piorum manibus locus , si , ut sapientibus placet , non cum corpore extinguuntur magnae animae , placide quiescas , nosque domum tuam ab infirmo desiderio et muliebribus lamentis ad contemplationem virtutum tuarum voces , quas neque lugeri neque plangi fas est$$ If there is any dwelling-place for the spirits of the just if ,  as the wise believe ,  noble souls do not perish with the body ,  rest thou in peace and call us ,  thy family ,  from weak regrets and womanish laments to the contemplation of thy virtues ,  for which we must not weep nor beat the breast
 Admiratione te potius et immortalibus laudibus et , si natura suppeditet , similitudine colamus$$ Let us honour thee not so much with transitory praises as with our reverence ,  and ,  if our powers permit us ,  with our emulation
 is verus honos , ea coniunctissimi cuiusque pietas$$ That will be true respect ,  that the true affection of thy nearest kin
 Id filiae quoque uxorique praeceperim , sic patris , sic mariti memoriam venerari , ut omnia facta dictaque eius secum revolvant , formamque ac figuram animi magis quam corporis complectantur , non quia intercedendum putem imaginibus quae marmore aut aere finguntur , sed ut vultus hominum , ita simulacra vultus imbecilla ac mortalia sunt , forma mentis aeterna , quam tenere et exprimere non per alienam materiam et artem , sed tuis ipse moribus possis$$ This ,  too ,  is what I would enjoin on daughter and wife ,  to honour the memory of that father ,  that husband ,  by pondering in their hearts all his words and acts ,  by cherishing the features and lineaments of his character rather than those of his person It is not that I would forbid the likenesses which are wrought in marble or in bronze but as the faces of men ,  so all similitudes of the face are weak and perishable things ,  while the fashion of the soul is everlasting ,  such as may be expressed not in some foreign substance ,  or by the help of art ,  but in our own lives
 Quidquid ex Agricola amavimus , quidquid mirati sumus , manet mansurumque est in animis hominum in aeternitae temporum , fama rerum$$ Whatever we loved ,  whatever we admired in Agricola ,  survives ,  and will survive in the hearts of men ,  in the succession of the ages ,  in the fame that waits on noble deeds
 nam multos veterum velut inglorios et ignobilis oblivio obruit$$ Over many indeed ,  of those who have gone before ,  as over the inglorious and ignoble ,  the waves of oblivion will roll
 Agricola posteritati narratus et traditus superstes erit$$ Agricola ,  made known to posterity by history and tradition ,  will live for ever
 Saepe ex me requiris , Iuste Fabi , cur , cum priora saecula tot eminentium oratorum ingeniis gloriaque floruerint , nostra potissimum aetas deserta et laude eloquentiae orbata vix nomen ipsum oratoris retineat$$ You often ask me ,  Justus Fabius ,  how it is that while the genius and the fame of so many distinguished orators have shed a lustre on the past ,  our age is so forlorn and so destitute of the glory of eloquence that it scarce retains the very name of orator
 neque enim ita appellamus nisi antiquos , horum autem temporum diserti causidici et advocati et patroni et quidvis potius quam oratores vocantur$$ That title indeed we apply only to the ancients ,  and the clever speakers of this day we call pleaders ,  advocates ,  counsellors ,  anything rather than orators
 Cui percontationi tuae respondere et tam magnae quaestionis pondus excipere , ut aut de ingeniis nostris male existimandum sit , si idem adsequi non possumus , aut de iudiciis , si nolumus , vix hercule auderem , si mihi mea sententia proferenda ac non disertissimorum , ut nostris temporibus , hominum sermo repetendus esset , quos eandem hanc quaestionem pertractantis iuvenis admodum audivi$$ To answer this question of yours ,  to undertake the burden of so serious an inquiry ,  involving ,  as it must ,  a mean opinion either of our capacities ,  if we cannot reach the same standard ,  or of our tastes ,  if we have not the wish ,  is a task on which I should scarcely venture had I to give my own views instead of being able to reproduce a conversation among men ,  for our time ,  singularly eloquent ,  whom ,  when quite a youth ,  I heard discussing this very question
 Ita non ingenio , sed memoria et recordatione opus est , ut quae a praestantissimis viris et excogitata subtiliter et dicta graviter accepi , cum singuli diversas vel easdem sed probabilis causas adferrent , dum formam sui quisque et animi et ingenii redderent , isdem nunc numeris isdemque rationibus persequar , servato ordine disputationis$$ And so it is not ability ,  it is only memory and recollection which I require I have to repeat now ,  with the same divisions and arguments ,  following closely the course of that discussion ,  those subtle reflections which I heard ,  powerfully expressed ,  from men of the highest eminence ,  each of whom assigned a different but plausible reason ,  thereby displaying the peculiarities of his individual temper and genius
 Neque enim defuit qui diversam quoque partem susciperet , ac multum vexata et inrisa vetustate nostrorum temporum eloquentiam antiquorum ingeniis anteferret$$ Nor indeed did the opposite side lack an advocate ,  who ,  after much criticism and ridicule of old times ,  maintained the superiority of the eloquence of our own days to the great orators of the past
 Nam postero die quam Curiatius Maternus Catonem recitaverat , cum offendisse potentium animos diceretur , tamquam in eo tragoediae argumento sui oblitus tantum Catonem cogitasset , eaque de re per urbem frequens sermo haberetur , venerunt ad eum Marcus Aper et Iulius Secundus , celeberrima tum ingenia fori nostri , quos ego utrosque non modo in iudiciis studiose audiebam , sed domi quoque et in publico adsectabar mira studiorum cupiditate et quodam ardore iuvenili , ut fabulas quoque eorum et disputationes et arcana semotae dictionis penitus exciperem , quamvis maligne plerique opinarentur , nec Secundo promptum esse sermonem et Aprum ingenio potius et vi naturae quam institutione et litteris famam eloquentiae consecutum$$ It was the day after Curiatius Maternus had given a reading of his Cato ,  by which it was said that he had irritated the feelings of certain great personages ,  because in the subject of his tragedy he had apparently forgotten himself and thought only of Cato While all Rome was discussing the subject ,  he received a visit from Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus ,  then the most famous men of genius at our bar Of both I was a studious hearer in court ,  and I also would follow them to their homes and when they appeared in public ,  from a singular zeal for my profession ,  and a youthful enthusiasm which urged me to listen diligently to their trivial talk ,  their more serious debates ,  and their private and esoteric descourse Yet many ill-naturedly thought that Secundus had no readiness of speech ,  and that Aper had won his reputation for eloquence by his cleverness and natural powers ,  more than by training and culture
 Nam et Secundo purus et pressus et , in quantum satis erat , profluens sermo non defuit , et Aper omni eruditione imbutus contemnebat potius litteras quam nesciebat , tamquam maiorem industriae et laboris gloriam habiturus , si ingenium eius nullis alienarum artium adminiculis inniti videretur$$ As a fact ,  Secundus had a pure ,  terse ,  and a sufficiently fluent style ,  while Aper ,  who was imbued with learning of all kinds ,  pretended to despise the culture which he really possessed He would have ,  so he must have thought ,  a greater reputation for industry and application ,  if it should appear that his genius did not depend on any supports from pursuits alien to his profession
 Igitur ut intravimus cubiculum Materni , sedentem ipsumque , quem pridie recitaverat librum , inter manus habentem deprehendimus Tum Secundus nihilne te inquit , Materne , fabulae malignorum terrent , quo minus offensas Catonis tui ames An ideo librum istum adprehendisti , ut diligentius retractares , et sublatis si qua pravae interpretationi materiam dederunt , emitteres Catonem non quidem meliorem , sed tamen securiorem Tum ille leges inquit quid Maternus sibi debuerit , et adgnosces quae audisti Quod si qua omisit Cato , sequenti recitatione Thyestes dicet hanc enim tragoediam disposui iam et intra me ipse formavi$$ So we entered the study of Maternus ,  and found him seated with the very book which he had read the day before ,  in his hands Secundus began Has the talk of ill-natured people no effect in deterring you ,  Maternus ,  from clinging to your Cato with its provocations
 Atque ideo maturare libri huius editionem festino , ut dimissa priore cura novae cogitationi toto pectore incumbam Adeo te tragoediae istae non satiant , inquit Aper quo minus omissis orationum et causarum studiis omne tempus modo circa Medeam , ecce nunc circa Thyestem consumas , cum te tot amicorum causae , tot coloniarum et municipiorum clientelae in forum vocent , quibus vix suffeceris , etiam si non novum tibi ipse negotium importasses , ut Domitium et Catonem , id est nostras quoque historias et Romana nomina Graeculorum fabulis adgregares$$ Or have you taken up the book to revise it more carefully ,  and ,  after striking out whatever has given a handle for a bad interpretation ,  will you publish ,  if not a better ,  at least a safer ,  Cato
 Et Maternus perturbarer hac tua severitate , nisi frequens et assidua nobis contentio iam prope in consuetudinem vertisset$$ This severity of yours ,  replied Maternus ,  would be quite a blow to us ,  had not our controversy from its frequency and familiarity become by this time almost a regular practice
 Nam nec tu agitare et insequi poetas intermittis , et ego , cui desidiam advocationum obicis , cotidianum hoc patrocinium defendendae adversus te poeticae exerceo$$ You ,  in fact ,  never cease from abusing and inveighing against poets ,  and I ,  whom you reproach with neglect of my professional duties ,  every day undertake to plead against you in defence of poetry
 Quo laetor magis oblatum nobis iudicem , qui me vel in futurum vetet versus facere , vel , quod iam pridem opto , sua quoque auctoritate compellat , ut omissis forensium causarum angustiis , in quibus mihi satis superque sudatum est , sanctiorem illam et augustiorem eloquentiam colam$$ So I am all the more delighted at the presence of a judge who will either forbid me for the future to write verses ,  or who will compel me by his additional authority to do what I have long desired ,  to give up the petty subleties of legal causes ,  at which I have toiled enough ,  and more than enough ,  and to cultivate a more sacred and more stately eloquence
 Ego vero inquit Secundus , antequam me iudicem Aper recuset , faciam quod probi et moderati iudices solent , ut in iis cognitionibus se excusent , in quibus manifestum est alteram apud eos partem gratia praevalere Quis enim nescit neminem mihi coniunctiorem esse et usu amicitiae et assiduitate contubernii quam Saleium Bassum , cum optimum virum tum absolutissimum poetam Porro si poetica accusatur , non alium video reum locupletiorem Securus sit inquit Aper et Saleius Bassus et quisquis alius studium poeticae et carminum gloriam fovet , cum causas agere non possit Ego enim , quatenus arbitrum litis huius inveniri , non patiar Maternum societate plurium defendi , sed ipsum solum apud omnes arguam , quod natus ad eloquentiam virilem et oratoriam , qua parere simul et tueri amicitias , adsciscere necessitudines , complecti provincias possit , omittit studium , quo non aliud in civitate nostra vel ad utilitatem fructuosius vel ad voluptatem dulcius vel ad dignitatem amplius vel ad urbis famam pulchrius vel ad totius imperii atque omnium gentium notitiam inlustrius excogitari potest Nam si ad utilitatem vitae omnia consilia factaque nostra derigenda sunt , quid est tutius quam eam exercere artem , qua semper armatus praesidium amicis , opem alienis , salutem periclitantibus , invidis vero et inimicis metum et terrorem ultro feras , ipse securus et velut quadam perpetua potentia ac potestate munitus cuius vis et utilitas rebus prospere fluentibus aliorum perfugio et tutela intellegitur sin proprium periculum increpuit , non hercule lorica et gladius in acie firmius munimentum quam reo et periclitanti eloquentia , praesidium simul ac telum , quo propugnare pariter et incessere sive in iudicio sive in senatu sive apud principem possis$$ For my part ,  said Secundus ,  before Aper refuses me as a judge ,  I will do as is usually done by upright and sensible judges ,  who excuse themselves in cases in which it is evident that one side has an undue influence with them Who knows not that no one is nearer my heart from long friendship and uninterrupted intercourse than Saleius Bassus ,  an excellent man ,  as well as a most accomplished poet
 Quid aliud infestis patribus nuper Eprius Marcellus quam eloquentiam suam opposuit Qua accinctus et minax disertam quidem , sed inexercitatam et eius modi certaminum rudem Helvidii sapientiam elusit plura de utilitate non dico , cui parti minime contra dicturum Maternum meum arbitror$$ Besides ,  if poetry is to be put on her defence ,  I know not a more influential defendant
 Ad voluptatem oratoriae eloquentiae transeo , cuius iucunditas non uno aliquo momento , sed omnibus prope diebus ac prope omnibus horis contingit$$ I pass now to the pleasure derived from the orator's eloquence Its delights are enjoyed not for a single moment ,  but almost on every day and at every hour
 Quid enim dulcius libero et ingenuo animo et ad voluptates honestas nato quam videre plenam semper et frequentem domum suam concursu splendidissimorum hominum idque scire non pecuniae , non orbitati , non officii alicuius administrationi , sed sibi ipsi dari$$ To the mind of an educated gentleman ,  naturally fitted for worthy enjoyments ,  what can be more delightful than to see his house always thronged and crowded by gatherings of the most eminent men ,  and to know that the honour is paid not to his wealth ,  his childlessness ,  or his possession of some office ,  but to himself
 ipsos quin immo orbos et locupletes et potentis venire plerumque ad iuvenem et pauperem , ut aut sua aut amicorum discrimina commendent$$ Nay ,  more the childless ,  the rich ,  and the powerful often go to one who is both young and poor ,  in order to intrust him with difficulties affecting themselves or their friends
 ullane tanta ingentium opum ac magnae potentiae voluptas quam spectare homines veteres et senes et totius orbis gratia subnixos in summa rerum omnium abundantia confitentis , id quod optimum sit se non habere$$ Can there be any pleasure from boundless wealth and vast power equal to that of seeing men in years ,  and even in old age ,  men backed by the influence of the whole world ,  readily confessing ,  amid the utmost affluence of every kind ,  that they do not possess that which is the best of all
 iam vero qui togatorum comitatus et egressus! Quae in publico species! Quae in iudiciis veneratio! Quod illud gaudium consurgendi adsistendique inter tacentis et in unum conversos! coire populum et circumfundi coram et accipere adfectum , quemcumque orator induerit! vulgata dicentium gaudia et imperitorum quoque oculis exposita percenseo$$ Again ,  look at the respectable citizens who escort the pleader to and from the court Look at his appearance in public ,  and the respect shown him before the judges What a delight it must be to rise and stand amid the hushed crowd ,  with every eye on him alone ,  the people assembling and gathering round him in a circle ,  and taking from the orator any emotion he has himself assumed
 illa secretiora et tantum ipsis orantibus nota maiora sunt$$ I am now reckoning the notorious joys of an orator ,  those which are open to the sight even of the uneducated
 Sive accuratam meditatamque profert orationem , est quoddam sicut ipsius dictionis , ita gaudii pondus et constantia$$ the more secret ,  known only to the advocate himself ,  are yet greater
 sive novam et recentem curam non sine aliqua trepidatione animi attulerit , ipsa sollicitudo commendat eventum et lenocinatur voluptati$$ If he produces a careful and well-prepared speech ,  there is a solidity and stedfastness in his satisfaction ,  just as there is in his style
 Sed extemporalis audaciae atque ipsius temeritatis vel praecipua iucunditas est$$ if ,  again ,  he offers his audience ,  not without some tremblings at heart ,  the result of a fresh and sudden effort ,  his very anxiety enhances the joy of success ,  and ministers to his pleasure
 nam in ingenio quoque , sicut in agro , quamquam grata sint quae diu serantur atque elaborentur , gratiora tamen quae sua sponte nascuntur$$ In fact ,  audacity at the moment ,  and rashness itself ,  have quite a peculiar sweetness
 Equidem , ut de me ipso fatear , non eum diem laetiorem egi , quo mihi latus clavus oblatus est , vel quo homo novus et in civitate minime favorabili natus quaesturam aut tribunatum aut praeturam accepi , quam eos , quibus mihi pro mediocritate huius quantulaecumque in dicendo facultatis aut reum prospere defendere aut apud centumviros causam aliquam feliciter orare aut apud principem ipsos illos libertos et procuratores principum tueri et defendere datur$$ To speak my own mind ,  I did not experience more job on the day on which I was presented with the robe of a senator ,  or when ,  as a new man ,  born in a far from influential state ,  I was elected quæstor ,  or tribune ,  or prætor ,  than on those on which it was my privilege ,  considering the insignificance of my ability as a speaker ,  to defend a prisoner with success ,  to win a verdict in a cause before the Court of the Hundred ,  or to give the support of my advocacy in the emperor's presence to the great freedmen themselves ,  or to ministers of the crown
 tum mihi supra tribunatus et praeturas et consulatus ascendere videor , tum habere quod , si non ultro oritur , nec codicillis datur nec cum gratia venit$$ On such occasions I seem to rise above tribunates ,  prætorships ,  and consulships ,  and to possess that which ,  if it be not of natural growth ,  is not bestowed by mandate ,  nor comes through interest
 Quid fama et laus cuius artis cum oratorum gloria comparanda est Quid Non inlustres sunt in urbe non solum apud negotiosos et rebus intentos , sed etiam apud iuvenes vacuos et adulescentis , quibus modo recta indoles est et bona spes sui$$ Again ,  is there an accomplishment ,  the fame and glory of which are to be compared with the distinction of the orator ,  who is an illustrious man at Rome ,  not only with the busy class ,  intent on public affairs ,  but even with people of leisure ,  and with the young ,  those at least who have a right disposition and a worthy confidence in themselves
 Quorum nomina prius parentes liberis suis ingerunt$$ Whose name does the father din into his children's ears before that of the orator
 Quos saepius vulgus quoque imperitum et tunicatus hic populus transeuntis nomine vocat et digito demonstrat$$ Whom ,  as he passes by ,  do the ignorant mob and the men with the tunic oftener speak of by name and point out with the finger
 Advenae quoque et peregrini iam in municipiis et coloniis suis auditos , cum primum urbem attigerunt , requirunt ac velut adgnoscere concupiscunt$$ Strangers too and foreigners ,  having heard of him in their towns and colonies ,  as soon as they have arrived at Rome ,  ask for him and are eager ,  as it were ,  to recognise him
 Ausim contendere Marcellum hunc Eprium , de quo modo locutus sum , et Crispum Vibium (libentius enim novis et recentibus quam remotis et oblitteratis exemplis utor) non minores esse in extremis partibus terrarum quam Capuae aut Vercellis , ubi nati dicuntur$$ As for Marcellus Eprius ,  whom I have just mentioned ,  and Crispus Vibius (it is pleasanter to me to cite recent and modern examples than those of a distant and forgotten past) ,  I would venture to argue that they are quite as great men in the remotest corners of the world as at Capua or Vercellae ,  where they are said to have been born
 Nec hoc illis alterius bis alterius ter milies sestertium praestat , quamquam ad has ipsas opes possunt videri eloquentiae beneficio venisse , sed ipsa eloquentia$$ Nor do they owe this to the three hundred million sesterces of the one ,  although it may seem that they must thank their eloquence for having attained such wealth
 cuius numen et caelestis vis multa quidem omnibus saeculis exempla edidit , ad quam usque fortunam homines ingenii viribus pervenerint , sed haec , ut supra dixi , proxima et quae non auditu cognoscenda , sed oculis spectanda haberemus$$ Eloquence itself is the cause Its inspiration and superhuman power have throughout all times shown by many an example what a height of fortune men have reached by the might of genius
 Nam quo sordidius et abiectius nati sunt quoque notabilior paupertas et angustiae rerum nascentis eos circumsteterunt , eo clariora et ad demonstrandam oratoriae eloquentiae utilitatem inlustriora exempla sunt , quod sine commendatione natalium , sine substantia facultatum , neuter moribus egregius , alter habitu quoque corporis contemptus , per multos iam annos potentissimi sunt civitatis ac , donec libuit , principes fori , nunc principes in Caesaris amicitia agunt feruntque cuncta atque ab ipso principe cum quadam reverentia diliguntur , quia Vespasianus , venerabilis senex et patientissimus veri , bene intellegit et ceteros quidem amicos suos iis niti , quae ab ipso acceperint quaeque ipsis accumulare et in alios congerere promptum sit , Marcellum autem et Crispum attulisse ad amicitiam suam quod non a principe acceperint nec accipi possit Ninimum inter tot ac tanta locum obtinent imagines ac tituli et statuae , quae neque ipsa tamen negleguntur , tam hercule quam divitiae et opes , quas facilius invenies qui vituperet quam qui fastidiat$$ But there are ,  as I said but now ,  instances close at hand ,  and we may know them ,  not by hearsay ,  but may see them with our eyes The lower and meaner their birth ,  the more notorious the poverty and the straitened means amid which their life began ,  the more famous and brilliant are they as examples to show the efficacy of an orator's eloquence Without the recommendation of birth ,  without the support of riches ,  neither of the two distinguished for virtue ,  one even despised for the appearance of his person ,  they have now for many years been the most powerful men in the state ,  and ,  as long as it suited them ,  they were the leaders of the bar At this moment ,  as leading men in the emperor's friendship they carry all before them ,  and even the leading man himself of the State esteems and almost reverences them Vespasian indeed ,  venerable in his old age and most tolerant of truth ,  knows well that while his other friends are dependent on what he has given them ,  and on what it is easy for him to heap and pile on others ,  Marcellus and Crispus ,  in becoming his friends ,  brought with them something which they had not received and which could not be received from a prince
 His igitur et honoribus et ornamentis et facultatibus refertas domos eorum videmus , qui se ab ineunte adulescentia causis forensibus et oratorio studio dederunt$$ Amid so much that is great ,  busts ,  inscriptions ,  and statues hold but a very poor place
 Nam carmina et versus , quibus totam vitam Maternus insumere optat (inde enim omnis fluxit oratio) , neque dignitatem ullam auctoribus suis conciliant neque utilitates alunt$$ As for song and verse to which Maternus wishes to devote his whole life (for this was the starting-point of his entire argument) ,  they bring no dignity to the author ,  nor do they improve his circumstances
 voluptatem autem brevem , laudem inanem et infructuosam consequuntur$$ Although your ears ,  Maternus ,  may loathe what I am about to say ,  I ask what good it is if Agamemnon or Jason speaks eloquently in your composition
 licet haec ipsa et quae deinceps dicturus sum aures tuae , Materne , respuant , cui bono est , si apud te Agamemnon aut Iason diserte loquitur$$ Who the more goes back to his home saved from danger and bound to you
 Quis ideo domum defensus et tibi obligatus redit$$ Our friend Saleius is an admirable poet ,  or ,  if the phrase be more complimentary ,  a most illustrious bard
 Quis Saleium nostrum , egregium poetam vel , si hoc honorificentius est , praeclarissimum vatem , deducit aut salutat aut prosequitur$$ but who walks by his side or attends his receptions or follows in his train
 Nempe si amicus eius , si propinquus , si denique ipse in aliquod negotium inciderit , ad hunc Secundum recurret aut ad te , Materne , non quia poeta es , neque ut pro eo versus facias$$ Why ,  if his friend or relative or even he himself stumbles into some troublesome affair ,  he will run to Secundus here ,  or to you ,  Maternus ,  not because you are a poet or that you may make verses for him
 hi enim Basso domi nascuntur , pulchri quidem et iucundi , quorum tamen hic exitus est , ut cum toto anno , per omnes dies , magna noctium parte unum librum excudit et elucubravit , rogare ultro et ambire cogatur , ut sint qui dignentur audire , et ne id quidem gratis$$ for verses come naturally to Bassus in his own home ,  and pretty and charming they are ,  though the result of them is that when ,  with the labour of a whole year ,  through entire days and the best part of the nights ,  he has hammered out ,  with the midnight oil ,  a single book ,  he is forced actually to beg and canvass for people who will condescend to be his hearers ,  and not even this without cost to himself
 nam et domum mutuatur et auditorium exstruit et subsellia conducit et libellos dispergit$$ He gets the loan of a house ,  fits up a room ,  hires benches ,  and scatters programmes
 Et ut beatissimus recitationem eius eventus prosequatur , omnis illa laus intra unum aut alterum diem , velut in herba vel flore praecerpta , ad nullam certam et solidam pervenit frugem , nec aut amicitiam inde refert aut clientelam aut mansurum in animo cuiusquam beneficium , sed clamorem vagum et voces inanis et gaudium volucre$$ Even if his reading is followed by a complete success ,  all the glory is ,  so to say ,  cut short in the bloom and the flower ,  and does not come to any real and substantial fruit He carries away with him not a single friendship ,  not a single client ,  not an obligation that will abide in anyone's mind ,  only idle applause ,  meaningless acclamations and a fleeting delight
 laudavimus nuper ut miram et eximiam Vespasiani liberalitatem , quod quingenta sestertia Basso donasset$$ We lately praised Vespasian's bounty ,  in giving Bassus four thousand pounds ,  as something marvellous and splendid
 pulchrum id quidem , indulgentiam principis ingenio mereri$$ It is no doubt a fine thing to win an emperor's favour by talent
 quanto tamen pulchrius , si ita res familiaris exigat , se ipsum colere , suum genium propitiare , suam experiri liberalitatem! adice quod poetis , si modo dignum aliquid elaborare et efficere velint , relinquenda conversatio amicorum et iucunditas urbis , deserenda cetera officia utque ipsi dicunt , in nemora et lucos , id est in solitudinem secedendum est$$ but how much finer ,  if domestic circumstances so require ,  to cultivate one ,  self ,  to make one's own genius propitious ,  to fall back on one's own bounty Consider too that a poet ,  if he wishes to work out and accomplish a worthy result ,  must leave the society of his friends ,  and the attractions of the capital
 Ne opinio quidem et fama , cui soli serviunt et quod unum esse pretium omnis laboris sui fatentur , aeque poetas quam oratores sequitur , quoniam mediocris poetas nemo novit , bonos pauci$$ Nor again do even reputation and fame ,  the only object of their devotion ,  the sole reward of their labours ,  by their own confession ,  cling to the poet as much as to the orator
 Quando enim rarissimarum recitationum fama in totam urbem penetrat$$ for indifferent poets are known to none ,  and the good but to a few
 Nedum ut per tot provincias innotescat$$ When does the rumour of the very choicest readings penetrate every part of Rome ,  much less is talked of throughout our numerous provinces
 Quotus quisque , cum ex Hispania vel Asia , ne quid de Gallis nostris loquar , in urbem venit , Saleium Bassum requirit$$ How few ,  when they visit the capital from Spain or Asia ,  to say nothing of our Gallic neighbours ,  ask after Saleius Bassus! And indeed ,  if any one does ask after him ,  having once seen him ,  he passes on ,  and is satisfied ,  as if he had seen a picture or a statue
 Atque adeo si quis requirit , ut semel vidit , transit et contentus est , ut si picturam aliquam vel statuam vidisset$$ I do not wish my remarks to be taken as implying that I would deter from poetry those to whom nature has denied the orator's talent ,  if only they can amuse their leisure and push themselves into fame by this branch of culture
 Neque hunc meum sermonem sic accipi volo , tamquam eos , quibus natura sua oratorium ingenium denegavit , deterream a carminibus , si modo in hac studiorum parte oblectare otium et nomen inserere possunt famae$$ For my part I hold all eloquence in its every variety something sacred and venerable ,  and I regard as preferable to all studies of other arts not merely your tragedian's buskin or the measures of heroic verse ,  but even the sweetness of the lyric ode ,  the playfulness of the elegy ,  the satire of the iambic ,  the wit of the epigram ,  and indeed any other form of eloquence
 Ego vero omnem eloquentiam omnisque eius partis sacras et venerabilis puto , nec solum cothurnum vestrum aut heroici carminis sonum , sed lyricorum quoque iucunditatem et elegorum lascivias et iamborum amaritudinem et epigrammatum lusus et quamcumque aliam speciem eloquentia habeat , anteponendam ceteris aliarum artium studiis credo Sed tecum mihi , Materne , res est , quod , cum natura tua in ipsam arcem eloquentiae ferat , errare mavis et summa adepturus in levioribus subsistis$$ But it is with you ,  Maternus ,  that I am dealing for ,  when your genius might carry you to the summit of eloquence ,  you prefer to wander from the path ,  and though sure to win the highest prize you stop short at meaner things Just as ,  if you had been born in Greece ,  where it is an honour to practise even the arts of the arena ,  and if the gods had given you the vigour and strength of Nicostratus ,  I should not suffer those giant arms meant by nature for combat to waste themselves on the light javelin or the throwing of the quoit ,  so now I summon you from the lecture-room and the theatre to the law court with its pleadings and its real battles
 ut si in Graecia natus esses , ubi ludicras quoque artis exercere honestum est , ac tibi Nicostrati robur ac vires di dedissent , non paterer inmanis illos et ad pugnam natos lacertos levitate iaculi aut iactu disci vanescere , sic nunc te ab auditoriis et theatris in forum et ad causas et ad vera proelia voco , cum praesertim ne ad illud quidem confugere possis , quod plerisque patrocinatur , tamquam minus obnoxium sit offendere poetarum quam oratorum studium$$ I do this the more because you cannot even fall back on the refuge which shelters many ,  the plea that the poet's pursuit is less liable to give offence than that of the orator In truth ,  with you the ardour of a peculiarly noble nature bursts forth ,  and the offence you give is not for the sake of a friend ,  but ,  what is more dangerous ,  for the sake of Cato Nor is this offending excused by the obligation of duty ,  or by the fidelity of an advocate ,  or by the impulse of a casual and sudden speech
 Effervescit enim vis pulcherrimae naturae tuae , nec pro amico aliquo , sed , quod periculosius est , pro Catone offendis$$ You have ,  it seems ,  prepared your part in having chosen a character of note who would speak with authority
 Nec excusatur offensa necessitudine officii aut fide advocationis aut fortuitae et subitae dictionis impetu$$ I foresee your possible answer
 meditatus videris aut elegisse personam notabilem et cum auctoritate dicturam$$ Hence ,  you will say ,  came the decisive approval
 Sentio quid responderi possit$$ this is the style which the lecture-room chiefly praises ,  and which next becomes the world's talk
 hinc ingentis ex his adsensus , haec in ipsis auditoriis praecipue laudari et mox omnium sermonibus ferri$$ Away then with the excuse of quiet and safety ,  when you are deliberately choosing a more doughty adversary
 Tolle igitur quietis et securitatis excusationem , cum tibi sumas adversarium superiorem$$ For myself ,  let it be enough to take a side in the private disputes of our own time
 Nobis satis sit privatas et nostri saeculi controversias tueri , in quibus expressis si quando necesse sit pro periclitante amico potentiorum aures offendere , et probata sit fides et libertas excusata$$ In these ,  if at any time necessity has compelled us on behalf of an imperilled friend to offend the ears of the powerful ,  our loyalty must be approved ,  our liberty of speech condoned
 Quae cum dixisset Aper acrius , ut solebat , et intento ore , remissus et subridens Maternus parantem inquit me non minus diu accusare oratores quam Aper laudaverat (fore enim arbitrabar ut a laudatione eorum digressus detrectaret poetas atque carminum studium prosterneret) arte quadam mitigavit , concedendo iis , qui causas agere non possent , ut versus facerent$$ Aper having said this with his usual spirit and with vehemence of utterance ,  Maternus replied good-humouredly with something of a smile I was preparing to attack the orators at as great length as Aper had praised them ,  for I thought that he would leave his praises of them and go on to demolish poets and the pursuit of poetry ,  but he appeased me by a sort of stratagem ,  granting permission to those who cannot plead causes ,  to make verses
 Ego autem sicut in causis agendis efficere aliquid et eniti fortasse possum , ita recitatione tragoediarum et ingredi famam auspicatus sum , cum quidem imperante Nerone inprobam et studiorum quoque sacra profanantem Vatinii potentiam fregi , et hodie si quid in nobis notitiae ac nominis est , magis arbitror carminum quam orationum gloria partum$$ For myself ,  though I am perhaps able to accomplish and effect something in pleading causes ,  yet it was by the public reading of tragedies that I first began to enter the path of fame ,  when in Nero's time I broke the wicked power of Vatinius by which even the sanctities of culture were profaned ,  and if at this moment I possess any celebrity and distinction I maintain that it has been acquired more by the renown of my poems than of my speeches
 ac iam me deiungere a forensi labore constitui , nec comitatus istos et egressus aut frequentiam salutantium concupisco , non magis quam aera et imagines , quae etiam me nolente in domum meam inruperunt$$ And so now I have resolved to throw off the yoke of my labours at the bar ,  and for trains of followers on my way to and from the court and for crowded receptions I crave no more than for the bronzes and busts which have invaded my house even against my will
 Nam statum cuiusque ac securitatem melius innocentia tuetur quam eloquentia , nec vereor ne mihi umquam verba in senatu nisi pro alterius discrimine facienda sint$$ For hitherto I have upheld my position and my safety better by integrity than by eloquence ,  and I am not afraid of having ever to say a word in the senate except to avert peril from another
 Nemora vero et luci et secretum ipsum , quod Aper increpabat , tantam mihi adferunt voluptatem , ut inter praecipuos carminum fructus numerem , quod non in strepitu nec sedente ante ostium litigatore nec inter sordes ac lacrimas reorum componuntur , sed secedit animus in loca pura atque innocentia fruiturque sedibus sacris$$ As to the woods and groves and that retirement which Aper denounced ,  they bring such delight to me that I count among the chief enjoyments of poetry the fact that it is composed not in the midst of bustle ,  or with a suitor sitting before one's door ,  or amid the wretchedness and tears of prisoners ,  but that the soul withdraws herself to abodes of purity and innocence ,  and enjoys her holy resting-place
 Haec eloquentiae primordia , haec penetralia$$ Here eloquence had her earliest beginnings
 hoc primum habitu cultuque commoda mortalibus in illa casta et nullis contacta vitiis pectora influxit$$ here is her inmost shrine In such guise and beauty did she first charm mortals ,  and steal into those virgin hearts which no vice had contaminated
 sic oracula loquebantur$$ Oracles spoke under these conditions
 Nam lucrosae huius et sanguinantis eloquentiae usus recens et ex malis moribus natus , atque , ut tu dicebas , Aper , in locum teli repertus$$ As for the present money-getting and blood-stained eloquence ,  its use is modern ,  its origin in corrupt manners ,  and ,  as you said ,  Aper ,  it is a device to serve as a weapon
 Ceterum felix illud et , ut more nostro loquar , aureum saeculum , et oratorum et criminum inops , poetis et vatibus abundabat , qui bene facta canerent , non qui male admissa defenderent$$ But the happy golden age ,  to speak in our own poetic fashion ,  knew neither orators nor accusations ,  while it abounded in poets and bards ,  men who could sing of good deeds ,  but not defend evil actions
 Nec ullis aut gloria maior aut augustior honor , primum apud deos , quorum proferre responsa et interesse epulis ferebantur , deinde apud illos dis genitos sacrosque reges , inter quos neminem causidicum , sed Orphea ac Linum ac , si introspicere altius velis , ipsum Apollinem accepimus$$ None enjoyed greater glory ,  or honours more august ,  first with the gods ,  whose answers they published ,  and at whose feasts they were present ,  as was commonly said ,  and then with the offspring of the gods and with sacred kings ,  among whom ,  so we have understood ,  was not a single pleader of causes ,  but an Orpheus ,  a Linus ,  and ,  if you care to dive into a remoter age ,  an Apollo himself
 vel si haec fabulosa nimis et composita videntur , illud certe mihi concedes , Aper , non minorem honorem Homero quam Demostheni apud posteros , nec angustioribus terminis famam Euripidis aut Sophoclis quam Lysiae aut Hyperidis includi$$ Or ,  if you think all this too fabulous and imaginary ,  at least you grant me that Homer has as much honour with posterity as Demosthenes ,  and that the fame of Euripides or Sophocles is bounded by a limit not narrower than that of Lysias or Hyperides
 Pluris hodie reperies , qui Ciceronis gloriam quam qui Virgilii detrectent$$ You will find in our own day more who disparage Cicero's than Virgil's glory
 nec ullus Asinii aut Messallae liber tam inlustris est quam Medea Ovidii aut Varii Thyestes$$ Nor is any production of Asinius or Messala so famous as Ovid's Medea or the Thyestes of Varius
 Ac ne fortunam quidem vatum et illud felix contubernium comparare timuerim cum inquieta et anxia oratorum vita$$ Look again at the poet's lot ,  with its delightful companionships
 licet illos certamina et pericula sua ad consulatus evexerint , malo securum et quietum Virgilii secessum , in quo tamen neque apud divum Augustum gratia caruit neque apud populum Romanum notitia$$ I should not be afraid of comparing it with the harassing and anxious life of the orator Orators ,  it is true ,  have been raised to consulships by their contests and perils ,  but I prefer Virgil's serene ,  calm ,  and peaceful retirement ,  in which after all he was not without the favour of the di-vine Augustus ,  and fame among the people of Rome
 Testes Augusti epistulae , testis ipse populus , qui auditis in theatro Virgilii versibus surrexit universus et forte praesentem spectantemque Virgilium veneratus est sic quasi Augustum$$ We have the testimony of the letters of Augustus ,  the testimony too of the people themselves ,  who ,  on hearing in the theatre some of Virgil's verses ,  rose in a body and did homage to the poet ,  who happened to be present as a spectator ,  just as to Augustus himself
 Ne nostris quidem temporibus Secundus Pomponius Afro Domitio vel dignitate vitae vel perpetuitate famae cesserit$$ Even in our own day ,  Pomponius Serundus need not yield to Domitius Aper on the score of a dignified life or an enduring reputation
 Nam Crispus iste et Marcellus , ad quorum exempla me vocas , quid habent in hac sua fortuna concupiscendum$$ As for your Crispus and Marcellus ,  whom you hold up to me as examples ,  what is there in their lot to be coveted
 Quod timent , an quod timentur$$ Is it that they are in fear themselves ,  or are a fear to others
 Quod , cum cotidie aliquid rogentur , ii quibus praestant indignantur$$ Is it that ,  while every day something is asked from them ,  those to whom they grant it feel indignant
 Quod adligati omni adulatione nec imperantibus umquam satis servi videntur nec nobis satis liberi$$ Is it that ,  bound as they are by the chain of flattery ,  they are never thought servile enough by those who rule ,  or free enough by us
 Quae haec summa eorum potentia est$$ What is their power at its highest
 tantum posse liberti solent$$ Why ,  the freedmen usually have as much
 Ne vero dulces , ut Virgilius ait , Musae , remotum a sollicitudinibus et curis et necessitate cotidie aliquid contra animum faciendi , in illa sacra illosque fontis ferant$$ For my self ,  as Virgil says ,  let the sweet muses lead me to their sacred retreats ,  and to their fountains far away from anxieties and cares ,  and the necessity of doing every day something repugnant to my heart
 nec insanum ultra et lubricum forum famamque pallentem trepidus experiar$$ Let me no longer tremblingly experience the madness and perils of the forum ,  and the pallors of fame
 Non me fremitus salutantium nec anhelans libertus excitet , nec incertus futuri testamentum pro pignore scribam , nec plus habeam quam quod possim cui velim relinquere$$ Let me not be aroused by a tumult of morning visitors ,  or a freedman's panting haste ,  or ,  anxious about the future ,  have to make a will to secure my wealth
 quandoque enim fatalis et meus dies veniet$$ Let me not possess more than what I can leave to whom I please ,  whenever the day appointed by my own fates shall come
 statuarque tumulo non maestus et atrox , sed hilaris et coronatus , et pro memoria mei nec consulat quisquam nec roget$$ and let the statue over my tomb be not gloomy and scowling ,  but bright and laurel-crowned
 Vixdum finierat Maternus , concitatus et velut instinctus , cum Vipstanus Messalla cubiculum eius ingressus est , suspicatusque ex ipsa intentione singulorum altiorem inter eos esse sermonem , num parum tempestivus inquit interveni secretum consilium et causae alicuius meditationem tractantibus Minime , minime inquit Secundus , atque adeo vellem maturius intervenisses delectasset enim te et Apri nostri accuratissimus sermo , cum Maternum ut omne ingenium ac studium suum ad causas agendas converteret exhortatus est , et Materni pro carminibus suis laeta , utque poetas defendi decebat , audentior et poetarum quam oratorum similior oratio Me vero inquit et sermo iste infinita voluptate adfecisset , atque id ipsum delectat , quod vos , viri optimi et temporum nostrorum oratores , non forensibus tantum negotiis et declamatorio studio ingenia vestra exercetis , sed eius modi etiam disputationes adsumitis , quae et ingenium alunt et eruditionis ac litterarum iucundissimum oblectamentum cum vobis , qui ista disputatis , adferunt , tum etiam iis , ad quorum auris pervenerint Itaque hercule non minus probari video in te , Secunde , quod Iuli Africani vitam componendo spem hominibus fecisti plurium eius modi librorum , quam in Apro , quod nondum ab scholasticis controversiis recessit et otium suum mavult novorum rhetorum more quam veterum oratorum consumere$$ Excited and ,  I say ,  full of enthusiasm ,  Maternus had hardly finished when Vipstanus Messala entered his room ,  and ,  from the earnest expression on each face ,  he conjectured that their conversation was unusually serious Have I ,  he asked ,  come among you unseasonably ,  while you are engaged in private deliberation ,  or the preparation of some case
 Tum Aper non desinis , Messalla , vetera tantum et antiqua mirari , nostrorum autem temporum studia inridere atque contemnere$$ Upon this Aper replied ,  You still persist ,  Messala ,  in admiring only what is old and antique and in sneering at and disparaging the culture of our own day
 Nam hunc tuum sermonem saepe excepi , cum oblitus et tuae et fratris tui eloquentiae neminem hoc tempore oratorem esse contenderes antiquis , eo , credo , audacius , quod malignitatis opinionem non verebaris , cum eam gloriam , quam tibi alii concedunt , ipse tibi denegares$$ I have often heard this sort of talk from you ,  when ,  forgetting the eloquence of yourself and your brother ,  you argued that nobody in this age is an orator And you did this ,  I believe ,  with the more audacity because you were not afraid of a reputation for ill-nature ,  seeing that the glory which others concede to you ,  you deny to yourself
 Neque illius inquit sermonis mei paenitentiam ago , neque aut Secundum aut Maternum aut te ipsum , Aper , quamquam interdum in contrarium disputes , aliter sentire credo$$ I feel no penitence ,  said Messala ,  for such talk ,  nor do I believe that Secundus or Maternus or you yourself ,  Aper ,  think differently ,  though now and then you argue for the opposite view
 Ac velim impetratum ab aliquo vestrum ut causas huius infinitae differentiae scrutetur ac reddat , quas mecum ipse plerumque conquiro$$ I could wish that one of you were prevailed on to investigate and describe to us the reasons of this vast difference
 Et quod quibusdam solacio est , mihi auget quaestionem , quia video etiam Graecis accidisse ut longius absit ab Aeschine et Demosthene Sacerdos ille Nicetes , et si quis alius Ephesum vel Mytilenas concentu scholasticorum et clamoribus quatit , quam Afer aut Africanus aut vos ipsi a Cicerone aut Asinio recessistis$$ I often inquire into them by myself That which consoles some minds ,  to me increases the difficulty For I perceive that even with the Greeks it has happened that there is a greater distance between Aeschines and Demosthenes on the one hand ,  and your friend Nicetes or any other orator who shakes Ephesus or Mitylene with a chorus of rhetoricians and their noisy applause ,  on the other ,  than that which separates Afer ,  Africanus ,  or yourselves from Cicero or Asinius
 Magnam inquit Secundus et dignam tractatu quaestionem movisti Sed quis eam iustius explicabit quam tu , ad cuius summam eruditionem et praestantissimum ingenium cura quoque et meditatio accessit Et Messalla aperiam inquit cogitationes meas , si illud a vobis ante impetravero , ut vos quoque sermonem hunc nostrum adiuvetis Pro duobus inquit Maternus promitto nam et ego et Secundus exsequemur eas partis , quas intellexerimus te non tam omisisse quam nobis reliquisse Aprum enim solere dissentire et tu paulo ante dixisti et ipse satis manifestus est iam dudum in contrarium accingi nec aequo animo perferre hanc nostram pro antiquorum laude concordiam$$ The question you have raised ,  said Secundus ,  is a great one and quite worthy of discussion
 Non enim inquit Aper inauditum et indefensum saeculum nostrum patiar hac vestra conspiratione damnari sed hoc primum interrogabo , quos vocetis antiquos , quam oratorum aetatem significatione ista determinetis Ego enim cum audio antiquos , quosdam veteres et olim natos intellego , ac mihi versantur ante oculos Ulixes ac Nestor , quorum aetas mille fere et trecentis annis saeculum nostrum antecedit vos autem Demosthenem et Hyperidem profertis , quos satis constat Philippi et Alexandri temporibus floruisse , ita tamen ut utrique superstites essent Ex quo apparet non multo pluris quam trecentos annos interesse inter nostram et Demosthenis aetatem Quod spatium temporis si ad infirmitatem corporum nostrorum referas , fortasse longum videatur si ad naturam saeculorum ac respectum inmensi huius aevi , perquam breve et in proximo est Nam si , ut Cicero in Hortensio scribit , is est magnus et verus annus , par quo eadem positio caeli siderumque , quae cum maxime est , rursum existet , isque annus horum quos nos vocamus annorum duodecim milia nongentos quinquaginta quattuor complectitur , incipit Demosthenes vester , quem vos veterem et antiquum fingitis , non solum eodem anno quo nos , sed etiam eodem mense extitisse$$ But who has a better claim to unravel it than yourself ,  you who to profound learning and transcendent ability have added reflection and study
 Sed transeo ad Latinos oratores , in quibus non Menenium , ut puto , Agrippam , qui potest videri antiquus , nostrorum temporum disertis anteponere soletis , sed Ciceronem et Caesarem et Caelium et Calvum et Brutum et Asinium et Messallam$$ But I pass to the Latin orators Among them ,  it is not ,  I imagine ,  Menenius Agrippa ,  who may seem ancient ,  whom you usually prefer to the speakers of our day ,  but Cicero ,  Caelius ,  Calvus ,  Brutus ,  Asinius ,  Messala
 quos quid antiquis potius temporibus adscribatis quam nostris , non video$$ Why you assign them to antiquity rather than to our own times ,  I do not see
 Nam ut de Cicerone ipso loquar , Hirtio nempe et Pansa consulibus , ut Tiro libertus eius scribit , septimo idus Decembris occisus est , quo anno divus Augustus in locum Pansae et Hirtii se et Quintus Pedium consules suffecit$$ With respect to Cicero himself ,  it was in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa ,  as his freedman Tiro has stated ,  on the 5th of December ,  that he was slain
 Statue sex et quinquaginta annos , quibus mox divus Augustus rem publicam rexit$$ In that same year the Divine Augustus elected himself and Quintus Pedius consuls in the room of Pansa and Hirtius
 adice Tiberii tris et viginti , et prope quadriennium Gai , ac bis quaternos denos Claudii et Neronis annos , atque illum Galbae et Othonis et Vitellii longum et unum annum , ac sextam iam felicis huius principatus stationem , qua Vespasianus rem publicam fovet centum et viginti anni ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem colliguntur , unius hominis aetas$$ Fix at fifty-six years the subsequent rule of the Divine Augustus over the state add Tiberius's three-and-twenty years ,  the four years or less of Caius ,  the twenty-eight years of Claudius and Nero ,  the one memorable long year of Galba ,  Otho ,  and Vitellius ,  and the now six years of the present happy reign ,  during which Vespasian has been fostering the public weal ,  and the result is that from Cicero's death to our day is a hundred and twenty years ,  one man's life-time
 Nam ipse ego in Britannia vidi senem , qui se fateretur ei pugnae interfuisse , qua Caesarem inferentem arma Britanniae arcere litoribus et pellere adgressi sunt$$ For I saw myself an old man in Britain who declared that he was present at the battle in which they strove to drive and beat back from their shores the arms of Cæsar when he attacked their island
 Ita si eum , qui armatus Gaius Caesari restitit , vel captivitas vel voluntas vel fatum aliquod in urbem pertraxisset , aeque idem et Caesarem ipsum et Ciceronem audire potuit et nostris quoque actionibus interesse$$ So ,  had this man who encountered Cæsar in the field ,  been brought to Rome either as a prisoner ,  or by his own choice or by some destiny ,  he might have heard Cæsar himself and Cicero ,  and also have been present at our own speeches
 Proximo quidem congiario ipsi vidistis plerosque senes , qui se a divo quoque Augusto semel atque iterum accepisse congiarium narrabant$$ At the last largess of the Emperor you saw yourselves several old men who told you that they had actually shared once and again in the gifts of the divine Augustus
 Ex quo colligi potest et Corvinum ab illis et Asinium audiri potuisse$$ Hence we infer that they might have heard both Corvinus and Asinius
 nam Corvinus in medium usque Augusti principatum , Asinius paene ad extremum duravit , ne dividatis saeculum , et antiquos ac veteres vocitetis oratores , quos eorundem hominum aures adgnoscere ac velut coniungere et copulare potuerunt$$ Corvinus indeed lived on to the middle of the reign of Augustus ,  Asinius almost to its close You must not then divide the age ,  and habitually describe as old and ancient orators those with whom the ears of the self-same men might have made acquaintance ,  and whom they might ,  so to say ,  have linked and coupled together
 Haec ideo praedixi , ut si qua ex horum oratorum fama gloriaque laus temporibus adquiritur , eam docerem in medio sitam et propiorem nobis quam Servio Galbae aut Gaius Carboni quosque alios merito antiquos vocaverimus$$ I have made these preliminary remarks to show that any credit reflected on the age by the fame and renown of these orators is common property ,  and is in fact more closely connected with us than with Servius Galba or Caius Carbo ,  and others whom we may rightly call ancients
 sunt enim horridi et inpoliti et rudes et informes et quos utinam nulla parte imitatus esset Calvus vester aut Caelius aut ipse Cicero$$ These indeed are rough ,  unpolished ,  awkward ,  and ungainly ,  and I wish that your favourite Calvus or Caelius or even Cicero had in no respect imitated them
 Agere enim fortius iam et audentius volo , si illud ante praedixero , mutari cum temporibus formas quoque et genera dicendi$$ I really mean now to deal with the subject more boldly and confidently ,  but I must first observe that the types and varieties of eloquence change with the age
 Sic Catoni seni comparatus Gaius Gracchus plenior et uberior , sic Graccho politior et ornatior Crassus , sic utroque distinctior et urbanior et altior Cicero , Cicerone mitior Corvinus et dulcior et in verbis magis elaboratus$$ Thus Caius Gracchus compared with the elder Cato is full and copious Crassus compared with Gracchus is polished and ornate Cicero compared with either is lucid ,  graceful ,  and lofty
 Nec quaero quis disertissimus$$ Corvinus again is softer and sweeter and more finished in his phrases than Cicero
 hoc interim probasse contentus sum , non esse unum eloquentiae vultum , sed in illis quoque quos vocatis antiquos pluris species deprehendi , nec statim deterius esse quod diversum est , vitio autem malignitatis humanae vetera semper in laude , praesentia in fastidio esse$$ I do not ask who is the best speaker Meantime I am content to have proved that eloquence has more than one face ,  and even in those whom you Call ancients several varieties are to be discovered Nor does it at once follow that difference implies inferiority
 Num dubitamus inventos qui prae Catone Appium Caecum magis mirarentur$$ It is the fault of envious human nature that the old is always the object of praise ,  the present of contempt
 satis constat ne Ciceroni quidem obtrectatores defuisse , quibus inflatus et tumens nec satis pressus , sed supra modum exsultans et superfluens et parum Atticus videretur$$ Can we doubt that there were found critics who admired Appius Caecus more than Cato We know that even Cicero was not without his disparagers ,  who thought him inflated ,  turgid ,  not concise enough ,  but unduly diffuse and luxuriant ,  in short anything but Attic
 legistis utique et Calvi et Bruti ad Ciceronem missas epistulas , ex quibus facile est deprehendere Calvum quidem Ciceroni visum exsanguem et aridum , Brutum autem otiosum atque diiunctum$$ You have read of course the letters of Calvus and Brutus to Cicero ,  and from these it is easy to perceive that in Cicero's opinion Calvus was bloodless and attenuated ,  Brutus slovenly and lax
 rursusque Ciceronem a Calvo quidem male audisse tamquam solutum et enervem , a Bruto autem , ut ipsius verbis utar , tamquam fractum atque elumbem$$ Cicero again was slightingly spoken of by Calvus as loose and nerveless ,  and by Brutus ,  to use his own words ,  as languid and effeminate
 si me interroges , omnes mihi videntur verum dixisse$$ If you ask me ,  I think they all said what was true
 sed mox ad singulos veniam , nunc mihi cum universis negotium est$$ But I shall come to them separately after a while
 Quis nunc feret oratorem de infirmitate valetudinis suae praefantem$$ Who will now tolerate an advocate who begins by speaking of the feebleness of his constitution ,  as is usual in the openings of Corvinus
 Qualia sunt fere principia Corvini$$ Who will sit out the five books against Verres
 Quis quinque in Verrem libros exspectabit$$ Who will endure those huge volumes ,  on a legal plea or form ,  which we have read in the speeches for Marcus Tullius and Aulus Caecina
 Quis de exceptione et formula perpetietur illa inmensa volumina , quae pro Marcus Tullio aut Aulo Caecina legimus$$ In our day the judge anticipates the speaker ,  and unless he is charmed and imposed on by the train of arguments ,  or the brilliancy of the thoughts ,  or the grace and elegance of the descriptive sketches ,  he is deaf to his eloquence
 Praecurrit hoc tempore iudex dicentem et , nisi aut cursu argumentorum aut colore sententiarum aut nitore et cultu descriptionum invitatus et corruptus est , aversatur dicentem$$ Even the mob of bystanders ,  and the chance listeners who flock in ,  now usually require brightness and beauty in a speech ,  and they no more endure in the law-court the harshness and roughness of antiquity ,  than they would an actor on the stage who chose to reproduce the gestures of Roscius or Ambivius
 Vulgus quoque adsistentium et adfluens et vagus auditor adsuevit iam exigere laetitiam et pulchritudinem orationis$$ So again the young ,  those whose studies are on the anvil ,  who go after the orators with a view to their own progress ,  are anxious not merely to hear but also to carry back home some brilliant passage worthy of remembrance
 nec magis perfert in iudiciis tristem et impexam antiquitatem quam si quis in scaena Roscii aut Turpionis Ambivii exprimere gestus velit$$ They tell it one to another ,  and often mention it in letters to their colonies and provinces ,  whether it is a reflection lighted up by a neat and pithy phrase ,  or a passage bright with choice and poetic ornament
 Iam vero iuvenes et in ipsa studiorum incude positi , qui profectus sui causa oratores sectantur , non solum audire , sed etiam referre domum aliquid inlustre et dignum memoria volunt$$ For we now expect from a speaker even poetic beauty ,  not indeed soiled with the old rust of Accius or Pacuvius ,  but such as is produced from the sacred treasures of Horace ,  Virgil ,  and Lucan
 traduntque in vicem ac saepe in colonias ac provincias suas scribunt , sive sensus aliquis arguta et brevi sententia effulsit , sive locus exquisito et poetico cultu enituit$$ Thus the age of our orators ,  in conforming itself to the ear and the taste of such a class ,  has advanced in beauty and ornateness
 Exigitur enim iam ab oratore etiam poeticus decor , non Accii aut Pacuvii veterno inquinatus , sed ex Horatii et Virgilii et Lucani sacrario prolatus$$ Nor does it follow that our speeches are less successful because they bring pleasure to the ears of those who have to decide
 Horum igitur auribus et iudiciis obtemperans nostrorum oratorum aetas pulchrior et ornatior extitit$$ What if you were to assume that the temples of the present day are weaker ,  because ,  instead of being built of rough blocks and ill-shaped tiles ,  they shine with marble and glitter with gold
 Equidem fatebor vobis simpliciter me in quibusdam antiquorum vix risum , in quibusdam autem vix somnum tenere$$ I will frankly admit to you that I can hardly keep from laughing at some of the ancients ,  and from falling asleep at others
 Nec unum de populo Canuti aut Atti    de Furnio et Toranio quique alios in eodem valetudinario haec ossa et hanc maciem probant$$ I do not single out any of the common herd ,  as Canutius ,  or Arrius ,  and others in the same sick-room ,  so to say ,  who are content with mere skin and bones
 ipse mihi Calvus , cum unum et viginti , utpar puto , libros reliquerit , vix in una et altera oratiuncula satis facit$$ Even Calvus ,  although he has left ,  I think ,  one-and-twenty volumes ,  scarcely satisfies me in one or two short speeches
 Nec dissentire ceteros ab hoc meo iudicio video$$ The rest of the world ,  I see ,  does not differ from my opinion about him
 quotus enim quisque Calvi in Asitium aut in Drusum legit At hercule in omnium studiosorum manibus versantur accusationes quae in Vatinium inscribuntur , ac praecipue secunda ex his oratio$$ for how few read his speeches against Asitius or Drusus! Certainly his impeachment of Vatinius ,  as it is entitled ,  is in the hands of students ,  especially the second of the orations
 est enim verbis ornata et sententiis , auribus iudicum accommodata , ut scias ipsum quoque Calvum intellexisse quid melius esset , nec voluntatem ei , quo minus sublimius et cultius diceret , sed ingenium ac vires defuisse$$ This ,  indeed ,  has a finish about the phrases and the periods ,  and suits the ear of the critic ,  whence you may infer that even Calvus understood what a better style is ,  but that he lacked genius and power rather than the will to speak with more dignity and grace
 Quid$$ What again from the speeches of Caelius do we admire
 Ex Caelianis orationibus nempe eae placent , sive universae sive partes earum , in quibus nitorem et altitudinem horum temporum adgnoscimus$$ Why ,  we like of these the whole ,  or at least parts ,  in which we recognise the polish and elevation of our own day
 Sordes autem illae verborum et hians compositio et inconditi sensus redolent antiquitatem$$ but ,  as for those mean expressions ,  those gaps in the structure of the sentences ,  and uncouth sentiments ,  they savour of antiquity
 nec quemquam adeo antiquarium puto , ut Caelium ex ea parte laudet qua antiquus est$$ No one ,  I suppose ,  is so thoroughly antique as to praise Caelius simply on the side of his antiqueness
 Concedamus sane Gaius Caesari , ut propter magnitudinem cogitationum et occupationes rerum minus in eloquentia effecerit , quam divinum eius ingenium postulabat , tam hercule quam Brutum philosophiae suae relinquamus$$ We may ,  indeed ,  make allowance for Caius Julius Cæsar ,  on account of his vast schemes and many occupations ,  for having achieved less in eloquence than his divine genius demanded from him ,  and leave him indeed ,  just as we leave Brutus to his philosophy
 nam in orationibus minorem esse fama sua etiam admiratores eius fatentur$$ Undoubtedly in his speeches he fell short of his reputation ,  even by the admission of his admirers
 nisi forte quisquam aut Caesaris pro Decio Samnite aut Bruti pro Deiotaro rege ceterosque eiusdem lentitudinis ac teporis libros legit , nisi qui et carmina eorundem miratur$$ I hardly suppose that any one reads Cæsar's speech for Decius the Samnite ,  or that of Brutus for King Deiotarus ,  or other works equally dull and cold ,  unless it is some one who also admires their poems
 fecerunt enim et carmina et in bibliothecas rettulerunt , non melius quam Cicero , sed felicius , quia illos fecisse pauciores sciunt$$ For they did write poems ,  and sent them to libraries ,  with no better success than Cicero ,  but with better luck ,  because fewer people know that they wrote them
 Ad Ciceronem venio , cui eadem pugna cum aequalibus suis fuit , quae mihi vobiscum est$$ I come now to Cicero
 Illi enim antiquos mirabantur , ipse suorum temporum eloquentiam anteponebat$$ He had the same battle with his contemporaries which I have with you
 nec ulla re magis eiusdem aetatis oratores praecurrit quam iudicio$$ They admired the ancients
 primus enim excoluit orationem , primus et verbis dilectum adhibuit et compositioni artem , locos quoque laetiores attentavit et quasdam sententias invenit , utique in iis orationibus , quas senior iam et iuxta finem vitae composuit , id est , postquam magis profecerat usuque et experimentis didicerat quod optimum dicendi genus esset Nam priores eius orationes non carent vitiis antiquitatis$$ he preferred the eloquence of his own time It was in taste more than anything else that he was superior to the orators of that age In fact ,  he was the first who gave a finish to oratory ,  the first who applied a principle of selection to words ,  and art to composition He tried his skill at beautiful passages ,  and invented certain arrangements of the sentence ,  at least in those speeches which he composed when old and near the close of life ,  that is when he had made more progress ,  and had learnt by practice and by many a trial ,  what was the best style of speaking
 lentus est in principiis , longus in narrationibus , otiosus circa excessus$$ As for his early speeches ,  they are not free from the faults of antiquity
 tarde commovetur , raro incalescit$$ He is tedious in his introductions ,  lengthy in his narrations ,  careless about digressions
 pauci sensus apte et cum quodam lumine terminantur$$ he is slow to rouse himself ,  and seldom warms to his subject ,  and only an idea here and there is brought to a fitting and a brilliant close
 Nihil excerpere , nihil referre possis , et velut in rudi aedificio , firmus sane paries et duraturus , sed non satis expolitus et splendens$$ There is nothing which you can pick out or quote ,  and the style is like a rough building ,  the wall of which indeed is strong and lasting ,  but not particularly polished and bright
 Ego autem oratorem , sicut locupletem ac lautum patrem familiae , non eo tantum volo tecto tegi quod imbrem ac ventum arceat , sed etiam quod visum et oculos delectet$$ Now I would have an orator ,  like a rich and grand householder ,  not merely be sheltered by a roof sufficient to keep off rain and wind ,  but by one to delight the sight and the eye
 non ea solum instrui supellectile quae necessariis usibus sufficiat , sed sit in apparatu eius et aurum et gemmae , ut sumere in manus et aspicere saepius libeat$$ not merely be provided with such furniture as is enough for necessary purposes ,  but also possess among his treasures gold and jewels ,  so that he may find a frequent pleasure in handling them and gazing on them
 Quaedam vero procul arceantur ut iam oblitterata et olentia$$ On the other hand ,  some things should be kept at a distance as being now obsolete and ill-savoured
 nullum sit verbum velut rubigine infectum , nulli sensus tarda et inerti structura in morem annalium componantur$$ There should be no phrase stained ,  so to speak ,  with rust
 fugitet foedam et insulsam scurrilitatem , variet compositionem , nec omnis clausulas uno et eodem modo determinet$$ no ideas should be expressed in halting and languid periods after the fashion of chronicles
 Nolo inridere rotam Fortunae et ius verrinum et illud tertio quoque sensu in omnibus orationibus pro sententia positum esse videatur$$ Phrases like Fortune's wheel and Verrine soup ,  I do not care to ridicule ,  or that stock ending of every third clause in all Cicero's speeches ,  it would seem to be ,  brought in as the close of a period
 nam et haec invitus rettuli et plura omisi , quae tamen sola mirantur atque exprimunt ii , qui se antiquos oratores vocitant$$ I have mentioned them with reluctance ,  omitting several ,  although they are the sole peculiarities admired and imitated by those who call themselves orators of the old school
 Neminem nominabo , genus hominum significasse contentus$$ I will not name any one ,  as I think it enough to have pointed at a class
 sed vobis utique versantur ante oculos isti , qui Lucilium pro Horatio et Lucretium pro Virgilio legunt , quibus eloquentia Aufidii Bassi aut Servilii Noniani ex comparatione Sisennae aut Varronis sordet , qui rhetorum nostrorum commentarios fastidiunt , oderunt , Calvi mirantur$$ Still ,  you have before your eyes men who read Lucilius rather than Horace ,  and Lucretius rather than Virgil ,  who have a mean opinion of the eloquence of Aufidius Bassus ,  and Servilius Nonianus compared with that of Sisenna or Varro ,  and who despise and loathe the treatises of our modern rhetoricians ,  while those of Calvus are their admiration
 Quos more prisco apud iudicem fabulantis non auditores sequuntur , non populus audit , vix denique litigator perpetitur$$ When these men prose in the old style before the judges ,  they have neither select listeners nor a popular audience
 adeo maesti et inculti illam ipsam , quam iactant , sanitatem non firmitate , sed ieiunio consequuntur$$ in short the client himself hardly endures them
 porro ne in corpore quidem valetudinem medici probant quae animi anxietate contingit$$ They are dismal and uncouth ,  and the very soundness of which they boast ,  is the result not so much of real vigour as of fasting
 parum est aegrum non esse$$ Even as to health of body ,  physicians are not satisfied with that which is attained at the cost of mental worry
 fortem et laetum et alacrem volo$$ It is a small matter not to be ill
 prope abest ab infirmitate , in quo sola sanitas laudatur$$ I like a man to be robust and hearty and full of life
 Vos vero , viri disertissimi , ut potestis , ut facitis , inlustrate saeculum nostrum pulcherrimo genere dicendi$$ If soundness is all that you can praise him for ,  he is not very far from being an invalid
 Nam et te , Messalla , video laetissima quaeque antiquorum imitantem , et vos , Materne ac Secunde , ita gravitati sensuum nitorem et cultum verborum miscetis , ea electio inventionis , is ordo rerum , ea , quotiens causa poscit , ubertas , ea , quotiens permittit , brevitas , is compositionis decor , ea sententiarum planitas est , sic exprimitis adfectus , sic libertatem temperatis , ut etiam si nostra iudicia malignitas et invidia tardaverit , verum de vobis dicturi sint posteri nostri$$ Be it yours ,  my eloquent friends ,  to grace our age to the best of your ability ,  as in fact you are doing ,  with the noblest style of oratory You ,  Messala ,  imitate ,  I observe ,  the choicest beauties of the ancients And you ,  Maternus and Secundus ,  combine charm and finish of ex-pression with weight of thought There is discrimination in the phrases you invent ,  order in the treatment of your subject ,  fullness ,  when the case demands it ,  conciseness ,  when it is possible ,  elegance in your style ,  and perspicuity in every sentence
 Quae cum Aper dixisset , adgnoscitisne inquit Maternus vim et ardorem Apri nostri$$ Aper having finished speaking ,  Maternus said ,  You recognise ,  do you not ,  our friend Aper's force and passion
 Quo torrente , quo impetu saeculum nostrum defendit! Quam copiose ac varie vexavit antiquos! Quanto non solum ingenio ac spiritu , sed etiam eruditione et arte ab ipsis mutuatus est per quae mox ipsos incesseret! Tuum tamen , Messalla , promissum immutasse non debet$$ With what a torrent ,  what a rush of eloquence has he been defending our age How full and varied was his tirade against the ancients! What ability and spirit ,  what learning and skill too did he show in borrowing from the very men themselves the weapons with which he forthwith proceeded to attack them! Still ,  as to your promise ,  Messala ,  there must for all this be no change
 Neque enim defensorem antiquorum exigimus , nec quemquam nostrum , quamquam modo laudati sumus , iis quos insectatus est Aper comparamus$$ We neither want a defence of the ancients ,  nor do we compare any of ourselves ,  though we have just heard our own praises ,  with those whom Aper has denounced
 Ac ne ipse quidem ita sentit , sed more vetere et a nostris philosophis saepe celebrato sumpsit sibi contra dicendi partis$$ Aper himself thinks otherwise he merely followed an old practice much in vogue with your philosophical school of assuming the part of an opponent
 Igitur exprome nobis non laudationem antiquorum (satis enim illos fama sua laudat) , sed causas cur in tantum ab eloquentia eorum recesserimus , cum praesertim centum et viginti annos ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem effici ratio temporum collegerit$$ Give us then not a panegyric on the ancients (their own fame is a sufficient panegyric) but tell us plainly the reasons why with us there has been such a falling off from their eloquence ,  the more marked as dates have proved that from the death of Cicero to this present day is but a hundred and twenty years
 At parce inquit Maternus et potius exsolve promissum Neque enim hoc colligi desideramus , disertiores esse antiquos , quod apud me quidem in confesso est , sed causas exquirimus , quas te solitum tractare dixisti , paulo ante plane mitior et eloquentiae temporum nostrorum minus iratus , antequam te Aper offenderet maiores tuos lacessendo Non sum inquit offensus Apri mei disputatione , nec vos offendi decebit , si quid forte auris vestras perstringat , cum sciatis hanc esse eius modi sermonum legem , iudicium animi citra damnum adfectus proferre Perge inquit Maternus et cum de antiquis loquaris , utere antiqua libertate , a qua vel magis degeneravimus quam ab eloquentia$$ For my own part I shall not scruple to mention men by name ,  that ,  with examples before us ,  we may the more easily perceive the successive steps of the ruin and decay of eloquence
 Et Messalla non reconditas , Materne , causas requiris , nec aut tibi ipsi aut huic Secundo vel huic Apro ignotas , etiam si mihi partis adsignatis proferendi in medium quae omnes sentimus$$ Messala continued Far from obscure are the causes which you seek Neither to yourself or to our friends ,  Secundus and Aper ,  are they unknown ,  though you assign me the part of speaking out before you what we all think
 Quis enim ignorat et eloquentiam et ceteras artis descivisse ab illa vetere gloria non inopia hominum , sed desidia iuventutis et neglegentia parentum et inscientia praecipientium et oblivione moris antiqui$$ Who does not know that eloquence and all other arts have declined from their ancient glory ,  not from dearth of men ,  but from the indolence of the young ,  the carelessness of parents ,  the ignorance of teachers ,  and neglect of the old discipline
 Quae mala primum in urbe nata , mox per Italiam fusa , iam in provincias manant$$ The evils which first began in Rome soon spread through Italy ,  and are now diffusing themselves into the provinces
 Quamquam vestra vobis notiora sunt$$ But your provincial affairs are best known to yourselves
 ego de urbe et his propriis ac vernaculis vitiis loquar , quae natos statim excipiunt et per singulos aetatis gradus cumulantur , si prius de severitate ac disciplina maiorum circa educandos formandosque liberos pauca praedixero$$ I shall speak of Rome ,  and of those native and home-bred vices which take hold of us as soon as we are horn ,  and multiply with every stage of life ,  when I have first said a few words on the strict discipline of our ancestors in the education and training of children
 Nam pridem suus cuique filius , ex casta parente natus , non in cellula emptae nutricis , sed gremio ac sinu matris educabatur , cuius praecipua laus erat tueri domum et inservire liberis$$ Every citizen's son ,  the child of a chaste mother ,  was from the beginning reared ,  not in the chamber of a purchased nurse ,  but in that mother's bosom and embrace ,  and it was her special glory to study her home and devote herself to her children
 Eligebatur autem maior aliqua natu propinqua , cuius probatis spectatisque moribus omnis eiusdem familiae suboles committeretur$$ It was usual to select an elderly kinswoman of approved and esteemed character to have the entire charge of all the children of the household
 coram qua neque dicere fas erat quod turpe dictu , neque facere quod inhonestum factu videretur$$ In her presence it was the last offence to utter an unseemly word or to do a disgraceful act
 Ac non studia modo curasque , sed remissiones etiam lususque puerorum sanctitate quadam ac verecundia temperabat$$ With scrupulous piety and modesty she regulated not only the boy's studies and occupations ,  but even his recreations and games
 Sic Corneliam Gracchorum , sic Aureliam Caesaris , sic Atiam Augusti matrem praefuisse educationibus ac produxisse principes liberos accepimus$$ Thus it was ,  as tradition says ,  that the mothers of the Gracchi ,  of Cæsar ,  of Augustus ,  Cornelia ,  Aurelia ,  Atia ,  directed their children's education and reared the greatest of sons
 Quae disciplina ac severitas eo pertinebat , ut sincera et integra et nullis pravitatibus detorta unius cuiusque natura toto statim pectore arriperet artis honestas , et sive ad rem militarem sive ad iuris scientiam sive ad eloquentiae studium inclinasset , id solum ageret , id universum hauriret$$ The strictness of the discipline tended to form in each case a pure and virtuous nature which no vices could warp ,  and which would at once with the whole heart seize on every noble lesson Whatever its bias ,  whether to the soldier's or the lawyer's art ,  or to the study of eloquence ,  it would make that its sole aim ,  and imbibe it in its fullness
 At nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae , cui adiungitur unus aut alter ex omnibus servis , plerumque vilissimus nec cuiquam serio ministerio adcommodatus$$ But in our day we entrust the infant to a little Greek servant-girl who is attended by one or two ,  commonly the worst of all the slaves ,  creatures utterly unfit for any important work
 Horum fabulis et erroribus et virides teneri statim et rudes animi imbuuntur$$ Their stories and their prejudices from the very first fill the child's tender and uninstructed mind
 nec quisquam in tota domo pensi habet , quid coram infante domino aut dicat aut faciat$$ No one in the whole house cares what he says or does before his infant master
 Quin etiam ipsi parentes non probitati neque modestiae parvulos adsuefaciunt , sed lasciviae et dicacitati , per quae paulatim impudentia inrepit et sui alienique contemptus$$ Even parents themselves familiarise their little ones ,  not with virtue and modesty ,  but with jesting and glib talk ,  which lead on by degrees to shamelessness and to contempt for themselves as well as for others
 Iam vero propria et peculiaria huius urbis vitia paene in utero matris concipi mihi videntur , histrionalis favor et gladiatorum equorumque studia$$ Really I think that the characteristic and peculiar vices of this city ,  a liking for actors and a passion for gladiators and horses ,  are all but conceived in the mother's womb
 quibus occupatus et obsessus animus quantulum loci bonis artibus relinquit Quotum quemque invenies qui domi quicquam aliud loquatur Quos alios adulescentulorum sermones excipimus , si quando auditoria intravimus$$ When these occupy and possess the mind ,  how little room has it left for worthy attainments! Few indeed are to be found who talk of any other subjects in their homes ,  and whenever we enter a class-room ,  what else is the conversation of the youths
 Ne praeceptores quidem ullas crebriores cum auditoribus suis fabulas habent$$ Even with the teachers ,  these are the more frequent topics of talk with their scholars
 colligunt enim discipulos non severitate disciplinae nec ingenii experimento , sed ambitione salutationum et inlecebris adulationis$$ In fact ,  they draw pupils ,  not by strictness of discipline or by giving proof of ability ,  but by assiduous court and cunning tricks of flattery
 Transeo prima discentium elementa , in quibus et ipsis parum laboratur$$ I say nothing about the learners' first rudiments
 nec in auctoribus cognoscendis nec in evolvenda antiquitate nec in notitiam vel rerum vel hominum vel temporum satis operae insumitur$$ Even with these little pains are taken ,  and on the reading of authors ,  on the study of antiquity and a knowledge of facts ,  of men and of periods ,  by no means enough labour is bestowed
 Sed expetuntur quos rhetoras vocant$$ It is rhetoricians ,  as they are called ,  who are in request
 quorum professio quando primum in hanc urbem introducta sit quamque nullam apud maiores nostros auctoritatem habuerit , statim dicturus referam necesse est animum ad eam disciplinam , qua usos esse eos oratores accepimus , quorum infinitus labor et cotidiana meditatio et in omni genere studiorum assiduae exercitationes ipsorum etiam continentur libris$$ When this profession was first introduced into our city ,  and how little esteem it had among our ancestors ,  I am now about to explain but I will first recall your attention to the training which we have been told was practised by those orators whose infinite industry ,  daily study and incessant application to every branch of learning are seen in the contents of their own books
 Notus est vobis utique Ciceronis liber , qui Brutus inscribitur , in cuius extrema parte (nam prior commemorationem veterum oratorum habet) sua initia , suos gradus , suae eloquentiae velut quandam educationem refert$$ You are doubtless familiar with Cicero's book ,  called Brutus In the latter part of it (the first gives an account of the ancient orators) he relates his own beginnings ,  his progress ,  and the growth ,  so to say ,  of his eloquence
 se apud Quintus Nucium ius civile didicisse , apud Philonem Academicum , apud Diodotum Stoicum omnis philosophiae partis penitus hausisse$$ He tells us that he learnt the civil law under Quintus Mucius ,  and that he thoroughly imbibed every branch of philosophy under Philo of the Academy and under Diodotus the Stoic
 neque iis doctoribus contentum , quorum ei copia in urbe contigerat , Achaiam quoque et Asiam peragrasse , ut omnem omnium artium varietatem complecteretur$$ that not content with the teachers under whom he had had the opportunity of studying at Rome ,  he travelled through Achaia and Asia Minor so as to embrace every variety of every learned pursuit
 Itaque hercule in libris Ciceronis deprehendere licet , non geometriae , non musicae , non grammaticae , non denique ullius ingenuae artis scientiam ei defuisse$$ Hence we really find in Cicero's works that he was not deficient in the knowledge of geometry ,  music ,  grammar ,  or ,  in short ,  any liberal accomplishment
 Ille dialecticae subtilitatem , ille moralis partis utilitatem , ille rerum motus causasque cognoverat$$ The subtleties of logic ,  the useful lessons of ethical science ,  the movements and causes of the universe ,  were alike known to him
 Ita est enim , optimi viri , ita ex multa eruditione et plurimis artibus et omnium rerum scientia exundat et exuberat illa admirabilis eloquentia$$ The truth indeed is this ,  my excellent friends ,  that Cicero's wonderful eloquence wells up and overflows out of a store of erudition ,  a multitude of accomplishments ,  and a knowledge that was universal
 neque oratoris vis et facultas , sicut ceterarum rerum , angustis et brevibus terminis cluditur , sed is est orator , qui de omni quaestione pulchre et ornate et ad persuadendum apte dicere pro dignitate rerum , ad utilitatem temporum , cum voluptate audientium possit$$ The strength and power of oratory ,  unlike all other arts ,  is not confined within narrow and straitened limits ,  but the orator is he who can speak on every question with grace ,  elegance ,  and persuasiveness ,  suitably to the dignity of his subject ,  the requirements of the occasion ,  and the taste of his audience
 Nec quisquam respondeat sufficere , ut ad tempus simplex quiddam et uniforme doceamur primum enim aliter utimur propriis , aliter commodatis , longeque interesse manifestum est , possideat quis quae profert an mutuetur$$ Let no one reply that it is enough for us to learn ,  as occasion requires ,  some single and detached subject
 deinde ipsa multarum artium scientia etiam aliud agentis nos ornat , atque ubi minime credas , eminet et excellit Idque non doctus modo et prudens auditor , sed etiam populus intellegit ac statim ita laude prosequitur , ut legitime studuisse , ut per omnis eloquentiae numeros isse , ut denique oratorem esse fateatur$$ In the first place we use our own property in one way ,  a loan in another ,  and there is evidently a wide difference between possessing what one exhibits and borrowing it
 quem non posse aliter existere nec extitisse umquam confirmo , nisi eum qui , tamquam in aciem omnibus armis instructus , sic in forum omnibus artibus armatus exierit Quod adeo neglegitur ab horum temporum disertis , ut in actionibus eorum huius quoque cotidiani sermonis foeda ac pudenda vitia deprehendantur$$ Next ,  the very knowledge of many subjects sits gracefully on us ,  even when we are otherwise engaged ,  and makes itself visible and conspicuous where you would least expect it
 ut ignorent leges , non teneant senatus consulta , ius huius civitatis ultro derideant , sapientiae vero studium et praecepta prudentium penitus reformident In paucissimos sensus et angustas sententias detrudunt eloquentiam velut expulsam regno suo , ut quae olim omnium artium domina pulcherrimo comitatu pectora implebat , nunc circumcisa et amputata , sine apparatu , sine honore , paene dixerim sine ingenuitate , quasi una ex sordidissimis artificiis discatur Ergo hanc primam et praecipuam causam arbitror , cur in tantum ab eloquentia antiquorum oratorum recesserimus$$ Even the average citizen ,  and not only the learned and critical hearer ,  perceives it ,  and forthwith showers his praises in the acknowledgment that the man has been a genuine student ,  has gone through every branch of eloquence ,  and is ,  in short ,  an orator
 Si testes desiderantur , quos potiores nominabo quam apud Graecos Demosthenem , quem studiosissimum Platonis auditorem fuisse memoriae proditum est Et Cicero his , ut opinor , verbis refert , quidquid in eloquentia effecerit , id se non rhetorum officinis , sed Academiae spatiis consecutum Sunt aliae causae , magnae et graves , quas vobis aperiri aequum est , quoniam quidem ego iam meum munus explevi , et quod mihi in consuetudine est , satis multos offendi , quos , si forte haec audierint , certum habeo dicturos me , dum iuris et philosophiae scientiam tamquam oratori necessariam laudo , ineptiis meis plausisse$$ And I maintain that the only orator is ,  and ever has been ,  one who ,  like a soldier equipped at all points going to the battle-field ,  enters the forum armed with every learned accomplishment
 Et Maternus mihi quidem inquit susceptum a te munus adeo peregisse nondum videris , ut incohasse tantum et velut vestigia ac liniamenta quaedam ostendisse videaris$$ For myself ,  replied Maternus ,  I do not think that you have completed the task which you undertook
 Nam quibus artibus instrui veteres oratores soliti sint , dixisti differentiamque nostrae desidiae et inscientiae adversus acerrima et fecundissima eorum studia demonstrasti$$ Far from it You have ,  I think ,  only made a beginning ,  and indicated ,  so to say ,  its traces and outlines
 cetera exspecto , ut quem ad modum ex te didici , quid aut illi scierint aut nos nesciamus , ita hoc quoque cognoscam , quibus exercitationibus iuvenes iam et forum ingressuri confirmare et alere ingenia sua soliti sint Neque enim solum arte et scientia , sed longe magis facultate et usu eloquentiam contineri , nec tu puto abnues et hi significare vultu videntur$$ You have indeed described to us the usual equipment of the ancient orators ,  and pointed out the contrast presented by our idleness and ignorance to their very diligent and fruitful studies
 Deinde cum Aper quoque et Secundus idem adnuissent , Messalla quasi rursus incipiens$$ I want to hear the rest
 quoniam initia et semina veteris eloquentiae satis demonstrasse videor , docendo quibus artibus antiqui oratores institui erudirique soliti sint , persequar nunc exercitationes eorum Quamquam ipsis artibus inest exercitatio , nec quisquam percipere tot tam reconditas tam varias res potest , nisi ut scientiae meditatio , meditationi facultas , facultati usus eloquentiae accedat$$ Having learnt from you what they knew ,  with which we are unacquainted ,  I wish also to be told the process of training by which ,  when mere lads ,  and when about to enter the forum ,  they used to strengthen and nourish their intellects
 per quae colligitur eandem esse rationem et percipiendi quae proferas et proferendi quae perceperis Sed si cui obscuriora haec videntur isque scientiam ab exercitatione separat , illud certe concedet , instructum et plenum his artibus animum longe paratiorem ad eas exercitationes venturum , quae propriae esse oratorum videntur$$ For you will not ,  I imagine ,  deny that eloquence depends much less on art and theory than on capacity and practice ,  and our friends here seem by their looks to think the same
 Ergo apud maiores nostros iuvenis ille , qui foro et eloquentiae parabatur , imbutus iam domestica disciplina , refertus honestis studiis deducebatur a patre vel a propinquis ad eum oratorem , qui principem in civitate locum obtinebat$$ It was accordingly usual with our ancestors ,  when a lad was being prepared for public speaking ,  as soon as he was fully trained by home discipline ,  and his mind was stored with culture ,  to have him taken by his father ,  or his relatives to the orator who held the highest rank in the state
 Hunc sectari , hunc prosequi , huius omnibus dictionibus interesse sive in iudiciis sive in contionibus adsuescebat , ita ut altercationes quoque exciperet et iurgiis interesset utque sic dixerim , pugnare in proelio disceret$$ The boy used to accompany and attend him ,  and be present at all his speeches ,  alike in the law-court and the assembly ,  and thus he picked up the art of repartee ,  and became habituated to the strife of words ,  and indeed ,  I may almost say ,  learnt how to fight in battle
 Magnus ex hoc usus , multum constantiae , plurimum iudicii iuvenibus statim contingebat , in media luce studentibus atque inter ipsa discrimina , ubi nemo inpune stulte aliquid aut contrarie dicit , quo minus et iudex respuat et adversarius exprobret , ipsi denique advocati aspernentur$$ Thereby young men acquired from the first great experience and confidence ,  and a very large stock of discrimination ,  for they were studying in broad daylight ,  in the very thick of the conflict ,  where no one can say anything foolish or self-contradictory without its being refuted by the judge ,  or ridiculed by the opponent ,  or ,  last of all ,  repudiated by the very counsel with him
 Igitur vera statim et incorrupta eloquentia imbuebantur et quamquam unum sequerentur , tamen omnis eiusdem aetatis patronos in plurimis et causis et iudiciis cognoscebant$$ Thus from the beginning they were imbued with true and genuine eloquence ,  and ,  although they attached themselves to one pleader ,  still they became acquainted with all advocates of their own standing in a multitude of cases before the courts
 habebantque ipsius populi diversissimarum aurium copiam , ex qua facile deprehenderent , quid in quoque vel probaretur vel displiceret$$ They had too abundant experience of the popular ear in all its greatest varieties ,  and with this they could easily ascertain what was liked or disapproved in each speaker
 Ita nec praeceptor deerat , optimus quidem et electissimus , qui faciem eloquentiae , non imaginem praestaret , nec adversarii et aemuli ferro , non rudibus dimicantes , nec auditorium semper plenum , semper novum , ex invidis et faventibus , ut nec bene nec male dicta dissimularentur$$ Thus they were not in want of a teacher of the very best and choicest kind ,  who could show them eloquence in her true features ,  not in a mere resemblance nor did they lack opponents and rivals ,  who fought with actual steel ,  not with a wooden sword ,  and the audience too was always crowded ,  always changing ,  made up of unfriendly as well as of admiring critics ,  so that neither success nor failure could be disguised
 Scitis enim magnam illam et duraturam eloquentiae famam non minus in diversis subselliis parari quam suis$$ You know ,  of course ,  that eloquence wins its great and enduring fame quite as much from the benches of our opponents as from those of our friends
 inde quin immo constantius surgere , ibi fidelius corroborari$$ nay ,  more ,  its rise from that quarter is steadier ,  and its growth surer
 Atque hercule sub eius modi praeceptoribus iuvenis ille , de quo loquimur , oratorum discipulus , fori auditor , sectator iudiciorum , eruditus et adsuefactus alienis experimentis , cui cotidie audienti notae leges , non novi iudicum vultus , frequens in oculis consuetudo contionum , saepe cognitae populi aures , sive accusationem susceperat sive defensionem , solus statim et unus cuicumque causae par erat$$ Undoubtedly it was under such teachers that the youth of whom I am speaking ,  the disciple of orators ,  the listener in the forum ,  the student in the law-courts ,  was trained and practised by the experiences of others The laws he learnt by daily hearing the faces of the judges were familiar to him the ways of popular assemblies were continually before his eyes he had frequent experience of the ear of the people ,  and whether he undertook a prosecution or a defence ,  he was at once singly and alone equal to any case
 Nono decimo aetatis anno Lucius Crassus Gaius Carbonem , unoetvicesimo Caesar Dolabellam , altero et vicesimo Asinius Pollio Gaius Catonem , non multum aetate antecedens Calvus Vatinium iis orationibus insecuti sunt , quas hodieque cum admiratione legimus$$ We still read with admiration the speeches in which Lucius Crassus in his nineteenth ,  Cæsar and Asinius Pollio in their twenty-first year ,  Calvus ,  when very little older ,  denounced ,  respectively ,  Carbo ,  Dolabella ,  Cato ,  and Vatinius
 At nunc adulescentuli nostri deducuntur in scholas istorum , qui rhetores vocantur , quos paulo ante Ciceronis tempora extitisse nec placuisse maioribus nostris ex eo manifestum est , quod a Crasso et Domitio censoribus claudere , ut ait Cicero , ludum impudentiae iussi sunt$$ But in these days we have our youths taken to the professors' theatre ,  the rhetoricians ,  as we call them The class made its appearance a little before Cicero's time ,  and was not liked by our ancestors ,  as is evident from the fact that ,  when Crassus and Domitius were censors ,  they were ordered ,  as Cicero says ,  to close the school of impudence
 Sed ut dicere institueram , deducuntur in scholas , in quibus non facile dixerim utrumne locus ipse an condiscipuli an genus studiorum plus mali ingeniis adferant$$ However ,  as I was just saying ,  the boys are taken to schools in which it is hard to tell whether the place itself ,  or their fellow-scholars ,  or the character of their studies ,  do their minds most harm
 Nam in loco nihil reverentiae est , in quem nemo nisi aeque imperitus intret$$ As for the place ,  there is no such thing as reverence ,  for no one enters it who is not as ignorant as the rest
 in condiscipulis nihil profectus , cum pueri inter pueros et adulescentuli inter adulescentulos pari securitate et dicant et audiantur$$ As for the scholars ,  there can be no improvement ,  when boys and striplings with equal assurance ad ,  dress ,  and are addressed by ,  other boys and striplings
 ipsae vero exercitationes magna ex parte contrariae$$ As for the mental exercises themselves ,  they are the reverse of beneficial
 Nempe enim duo genera materiarum apud rhetoras tractantur , suasoriae et controversiae$$ Two kinds of subject-matter are dealt with before the rhetoricians ,  the persuasive and the controversial
 Ex his suasoriae quidem etsi tamquam plane leviores et minus prudentiae exigentes pueris delegantur , controversiae robustioribus adsignantur , quales , per fidem , et quam incredibiliter compositae! sequitur autem , ut materiae abhorrenti a veritate declamatio quoque adhibeatur$$ The persuasive ,  as being comparatively easy and requiring less skill ,  is given to boys The controversial is assigned to riper scholars ,  and ,  good heavens! what strange and astonishing productions are the result! It comes to pass that subjects remote from all reality are actually used for declamation
 Sic fit ut tyrannicidarum praemia aut vitiatarum electiones aut pestilentiae remedia aut incesta matrum aut quidquid in schola cotidie agitur , in foro vel raro vel numquam , ingentibus verbis persequantur$$ Thus the reward of a tyrannicide ,  or the choice of an outraged maiden ,  or a remedy for a pestilence ,  or a mother's incest ,  anything ,  in short ,  daily discussed in our schools ,  never ,  or but very rarely in the courts ,  is dwelt on in grand language
 $$ Great eloquence ,  like fire ,  grows with its material
 $$ it becomes fiercer with movement ,  and brighter as it burns
 $$ On this same principle was developed in our state too the eloquence of antiquity
 rem cogitant nihil humile , nihil abiectum eloqui poterat Magna eloquentia , sicut flamma , materia alitur et motibus excitatur et urendo clarescit Eadem ratio in nostra quoque civitate antiquorum eloquentiam provexit$$ Although even the modern orator has attained all that the circumstances of a settled ,  quiet ,  and prosperous community allow ,  still in the disorder and licence of the past more seemed to be within the reach of the speaker ,  when ,  amid a universal confusion that needed one guiding hand ,  he exactly adapted his wisdom to the bewildered people's capacity of conviction
 Nam etsi horum quoque temporum oratores ea consecuti sunt , quae composita et quieta et beata re publica tribui fas erat , tamen illa perturbatione ac licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur , cum mixtis omnibus et moderatore uno carentibus tantum quisque orator saperet , quantum erranti populo persuaderi poterat$$ Hence ,  laws without end and consequent popularity hence ,  speeches of magistrates who ,  I may say ,  passed nights on the Rostra hence ,  prosecutions of influential citizens brought to trial ,  and feuds transmitted to whole families hence ,  factions among the nobles ,  and incessant strife between the senate and the people
 Hinc leges assiduae et populare nomen , hinc contiones magistratuum paene pernoctantium in rostris , hinc accusationes potentium reorum et adsignatae etiam domibus inimicitiae , hinc procerum factiones et assidua senatus adversus plebem certamina$$ In each case the state was torn asunder ,  but the eloquence of the age was exercised and ,  as it seemed ,  was loaded with great rewards For the more powerful a man was as a speaker ,  the more easily did he obtain office ,  the more decisively superior was he to his colleagues in office ,  the more influence did he acquire with the leaders of the state ,  the more weight in the senate ,  the more notoriety and fame with the people
 Quae singula etsi distrahebant rem publicam , exercebant tamen illorum temporum eloquentiam et magnis cumulare praemiis videbantur , quia quanto quisque plus dicendo poterat , tanto facilius honores adsequebatur , tanto magis in ipsis honoribus collegas suos anteibat , tanto plus apud principes gratiae , plus auctoritatis apud patres , plus notitiae ac nominis apud plebem parabat$$ Such men had a host of clients ,  even among foreign nations the magistrates ,  when leaving Rome for the provinces ,  showed them respect ,  and courted their favour as soon as they returned The prætorship and the consulship seemed to offer themselves to them ,  and even when they were out of office ,  they were not out of power ,  for they swayed both people and senate with their counsels and influence
 Hi clientelis etiam exterarum nationum redundabant , hos ituri in provincias magistratus reverebantur , hos reversi colebant , hos et praeturae et consulatus vocare ultro videbantur , hi ne privati quidem sine potestate erant , cum et populum et senatum consilio et auctoritate regerent$$ Indeed ,  they had quite convinced themselves that without eloquence no one could win or retain a distinguished and eminent position in the state And no wonder Even against their own wish they had to show themselves before the people It was little good for them to give a brief vote in the senate without sup-porting their opinion with ability and eloquence
 Quin immo sibi ipsi persuaserant neminem sine eloquentia aut adsequi posse in civitate aut tueri conspicuum et eminentem locum$$ If brought into popular odium ,  or under some charge ,  they had to reply in their own words
 Nec mirum , cum etiam inviti ad populum producerentur , cum parum esset in senatu breviter censere , nisi qui ingenio et eloquentia sententiam suam tueretur , cum in aliquam invidiam aut crimen vocati sua voce respondendum haberent , cum testimonia quoque in publicis iudiciis non absentes nec per tabellam dare , sed coram et praesentes dicere cogerentur$$ Again ,  they were under the necessity of giving evidence in the public courts ,  not in their absence by affidavit ,  but of being present and of speaking it openly There was thus a strong stimulus to win the great prizes of eloquence ,  and as the reputation of a good speaker was considered an honour and a glory ,  so it was thought a disgrace to seem mute and speechless
 Ita ad summa eloquentiae praemia magna etiam necessitas accedebat , et quo modo disertum haberi pulchrum et gloriosum , sic contra mutum et elinguem videri deforme habebatur$$ Shame therefore quite as much as hope of reward prompted men not to take the place of a pitiful client rather than that of a patron ,  or to see hereditary connections transferred to others ,  or to seem spiritless and incapable of office from either failing to obtain it or from holding it weakly when obtained
 Transeo ad formam et consuetudinem veterum iudiciorum$$ I pass now to the forms and character of procedure in the old courts
 Quae etsi nunc aptior est ita erit , eloquentiam tamen illud forum magis exercebat , in quo nemo intra paucissimas horas perorare cogebatur et liberae comperendinationes erant et modum in dicendo sibi quisque sumebat et numerus neque dierum neque patronorum finiebatur$$ As they exist now ,  they are indeed more favourable to truth ,  but the forum in those days was a better training for eloquence There no speaker was under the necessity of concluding within a very few hours there was freedom of adjournment ,  and every one fixed for himself the limits of his speech ,  and there was no prescribed number of days or of counsel
 primus haec tertio consulatu Gnaeus Pompeius adstrinxit imposuitque veluti frenos eloquentiae , ita tamen ut omnia in foro , omnia legibus , omnia apud praetores gererentur$$ It was Cneius Pompeius who ,  in his third consulship ,  first restricted all this ,  and put a bridle ,  so to say ,  on eloquence ,  intending ,  however ,  that all business should be transacted in the forum according to law ,  and before the prætors
 apud quos quanto maiora negotia olim exerceri solita sint , quod maius argumentum est quam quod causae centumvirales , quae nunc primum obtinent locum , adeo splendore aliorum iudiciorum obruebantur , ut neque Ciceronis neque Caesaris neque Bruti neque Caelii neque Calvi , non denique ullius magni oratoris liber apud centumviros dictus legatur , exceptis orationibus Asinii , quae pro heredibus Urbiniae inscribuntur , ab ipso tamen Pollione mediis divi Augusti temporibus habitae , postquam longa temporum quies et continuum populi otium et assidua senatus tranquillitas et maxime principis disciplina ipsam quoque eloquentiam sicut omnia alia pacaverat$$ Here is a stronger proof of the greater importance of the cases tried before these judges than in the fact that causes in the Court of the Hundred ,  causes which now hold the first place ,  were then so eclipsed by the fame of other trials that not a speech of Cicero ,  or Cæsar ,  or Brutus ,  or Caelius ,  or Calvus ,  or ,  in short ,  any great orator is now read ,  that was delivered in that Court ,  except only the orations of Asinius Pollio for the heirs of Urbinia ,  as they are entitled ,  and even Pollio delivered these in the middle of the reign of Augustus ,  a period of long rest ,  of unbroken repose for the people and tranquillity for the senate ,  when the emperor's perfect discipline had put its restraints on eloquence as well as on all else
 Iam vero contiones assiduae et datum ius potentissimum quemque vexandi atque ipsa inimicitiarum gloria , cum se plurimi disertorum ne a Publio quidem Scipione aut Lucius Sulla aut Gnaeus Pompeio abstinerent , et ad incessendos principes viros , ut est natura invidiae , populi quoque ut histriones auribus uterentur , quantum ardorem ingeniis , quas oratoribus faces admovebant$$ Again ,  what stimulus to genius and what fire to the orator was furnished by incessant popular assemblies ,  by the privilege of attacking the most influential men ,  and by the very glory of such feuds when most of the good speakers did not spare even a Publius Scipio ,  or a Sulla ,  or a Cneius Pompeius ,  and following the common impulse of envy availed themselves of the popular ear for invective against eminent citizens
 Non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur et quae probitate et modestia gaudeat , sed est magna illa et notabilis eloquentia alumna licentiae , quam stulti libertatem vocitant , comes seditionum , effrenati populi incitamentum , sine obsequio , sine severitate , contumax , temeraria , adrogans , quae in bene constitutis civitatibus non oritur$$ I am not speaking of a quiet and peaceful accomplishment ,  which delights in what is virtuous and well regulated No the great and famous eloquence of old is the nursling of the licence which fools called freedom it is the companion of sedition ,  the stimulant of an unruly people ,  a stranger to obedience and subjection ,  a defiant ,  reckless ,  presumptuous thing which does not show itself in a well-governed state
 Quem enim oratorem Lacedaemonium , quem Cretensem accepimus$$ What orator have we ever heard of at Sparta or at Crete
 Quarum civitatum severissima disciplina et severissimae leges traduntur$$ A very strict discipline and very strict laws prevailed ,  tradition says ,  in both those states
 Ne Macedonum quidem ac Persarum aut ullius gentis , quae certo imperio contenta fuerit , eloquentiam novimus$$ Nor do we know of the existence of eloquence among the Macedonians or Persians ,  or in any people content with a settled government
 Rhodii quidam , plurimi Athenienses oratores extiterunt , apud quos omnia populus , omnia imperiti , omnia , ut sic dixerim , omnes poterant$$ There were some orators at Rhodes and a host of them at Athens ,  but there the people ,  there any ignorant fellow ,  anybody ,  in short ,  could do anything
 Nostra quoque civitas , donec erravit , donec se partibus et dissensionibus et discordiis confecit , donec nulla fuit in foro pax , nulla in senatu concordia , nulla in iudiciis moderatio , nulla superiorum reverentia , nullus magistratuum modus , tulit sine dubio valentiorem eloquentiam , sicut indomitus ager habet quasdam herbas laetiores$$ So too our own state ,  while it went astray and wore out its strength in factious strife and discord ,  with neither peace in the forum ,  unity in the senate ,  order in the courts ,  respect for merit ,  or seemly behaviour in the magistrates ,  produced beyond all question a more vigorous eloquence ,  just as an untilled field yields certain herbage in special plenty
 Sed nec tanti rei publicae Gracchorum eloquentia fuit , ut pateretur et leges , nec bene famam eloquentiae Cicero tali exitu pensavit$$ Still the eloquence of the Gracchi was not an equivalent to Rome for having to endure their legislation ,  and Cicero's fame as an orator was a poor compensation for the death he died
 Sic quoque quod superest antiquis oratoribus fori non emendatae nec usque ad votum compositae civitatis argumentum est$$ And so now the forum ,  which is all that our speakers have left them of antiquity ,  is an evidence of a state not thoroughly reformed or as orderly as we could wish
 Quis enim nos advocat nisi aut nocens aut miser$$ Who but the guilty or unfortunate apply to us
 Quod municipium in clientelam nostram venit , nisi quod aut vicinus populus aut domestica discordia agitat$$ What town puts itself under our protection but one harassed by its neighbours or by strife at home
 Quam provinciam tuemur nisi spoliatam vexatamque$$ When we plead for a province ,  is it not one that has been plundered and ill-treated
 Atqui melius fuisset non queri quam vindicari$$ Surely it would be better not to complain than to have to seek redress
 Quod si inveniretur aliqua civitas , in qua nemo peccaret , supervacuus esset inter innocentis orator sicut inter sanos medicus$$ Could a community be found in which no one did wrong ,  an orator would be as superfluous among its innocent people as a physician among the healthy
 Quo modo tamen minimum usus minimumque profectus ars medentis habet in iis gentibus , quae firmissima valetudine ac saluberrimis corporibus utuntur , sic minor oratorum honor obscuriorque gloria est inter bonos mores et in obsequium regentis paratos$$ As the healing art is of very little use and makes very little progress in nations which enjoy particularly robust constitutions and vigorous frames ,  so the orator gets an inferior and less splendid renown where a sound morality and willing obedience to authority prevail
 Quid enim opus est longis in senatu sententiis , cum optimi cito consentiant Quid multis apud populum contionibus , cum de re publica non imperiti et multi deliberent , sed sapientissimus et unus$$ What need there of long speeches in the senate ,  when the best men are soon of one mind ,  or of endless harangues to the people ,  when political questions are decided not by an ignorant multitude ,  but by one man of pre-eminent wisdom
 Quid voluntariis accusationibus , cum tam raro et tam parce peccetur Quid invidiosis et excedentibus modum defensionibus , cum clementia cognoscentis obviam periclitantibus eat credite , optimi et in quantum opus est disertissimi viri , si aut vos prioribus saeculis aut illi , quos miramur , his nati essent , ac deus aliquis vitas ac vestra tempora repente mutasset , nec vobis summa illa laus et gloria in eloquentia neque illis modus et temperamentum defuisset$$ What need of voluntary prosecutions ,  when crimes are so rare and slight ,  or of defences full of spiteful insinuation and exceeding proper bounds ,  when the clemency of the judge offers itself to the accused in his peril
