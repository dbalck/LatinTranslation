 after which the horse returned to curio , and brought some , prisoners with them . 
 while with this world-wide convulsion the imperial power was changing hands , the conduct of primus antonius , after the fall of cremona , was by no means as blameless as before either he believed that the necessities of the war had been satisfied , and that all else would follow easily , or , perhaps , success , working on such a temperament , developed his latent pride , rapacity and other vices
 the light , however , shining from behind , favoured the flavianists
 she professed virtue , while she practised laxity
 we have at last found men to check those murderous missives by the sword
 however , domitius with difficulty restrained his men , and prevented their beginning a battle ; the more so as a rivulet with steep banks , joining scipio's camp , retarded the progress of our men . 
 the wife of crassus , sulpicia praetextata , and her four children were ready , should the senate take cognizance of the cause , to demand vengeance
 contributions of gold and silver and virgin ores , never smelted in the furnace , but still in their natural state , were showered on the foundations
 accordingly , taking advantage of the unusual ardor of the soldiers , he began his assault on the town at a little after three o'clock on the very day on which he arrived , and took it , though defended with very high walls , before sunset , and gave it up to his army to plunder , and immediately decamped from before it , and marched to metropolis , with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumor of the taking of gomphi . 
the same day , embassadors sent by the enemy came to caesar to negotiate a peace .
 that it might not be thought that the opinion of the senate was disregarded , or that impunity was accorded to all acts done in the days of nero , mucianus sent back to their islands two men of senatorial rank , octavius sagitta and antistius sosianus , who had quitted their places of banishment
 he was hasty in his plans , though eminently successful in their results
this is nearly in the middle of the eburones , where titurius and aurunculeius had been quartered for the purpose of wintering .
 the rest are hiding themselves in their camp , or are thinking anxiously of flight
they flocked to whatever part of the works seemed weakest .
in this was the greatest difficulty , for the following reasons , namely , because our ships , on account of their great size , could be stationed only in deep water ; and our soldiers , in places unknown to them , with their hands embarrassed , oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor , had at the same time to leap from the ships , stand amid the waves , and encounter the enemy ; whereas they , either on dry ground , or advancing a little way into the water , free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known to them , could confidently throw their weapons and spur on their horses , which were accustomed to this kind of service .
 tiberius ordered these insults , which trio's heirs had suppressed , to be publicly read , thus showing his tolerance of free speech in others and despising his own shame , or , possibly , because he had long been ignorant of the villanies of sejanus , and now wished any remarks , however reckless , to published , and so to ascertain , through invective , if it must be so , the truth , which flattery obscures
 nor were there merely whispered complaints while claudius was administering justice , the populace crowded round him with a boisterous clamour and drove him to a corner of the forum , where they violently pressed on him till he broke through the furious mob with a body of soldiers
 the labour , new as it was to the soldiery of the capital , broke their spirits
he himself determines to winter at bibracte .
 on this occasion , the emperor , who had generally a strong contempt for honours , and now thought it right to reply to the rumour which reproached him with having yielded to vanity , delivered the following speech 
 about the two first there is a general agreement , but instead of arruntius some have mentioned cneius piso , and all these men , except lepidus , were soon afterwards destroyed by various charges through the contrivance of tiberius
 they appealed too to the of lucius sulla , whose army was once in terrible jeopardy from a severe winter and want of clothing , and this having been announced at smyrna in a public assembly , all who were present stript their clothes off their backs and sent them to our legions
 the other side for the increase of their dominion
 he transacted no public business through freedmen or slaves no private leanings , no recommendations or entreaties of friends , moved him in the selection of centurions and soldiers , but it was ever the best man whom he thought most trustworthy
 and it was with difficulty that they were then restrained from breaking into the town , and they were much displeased , because they imagined that they were prevented by trebonius from taking possession of it . 
 similar hopes of a province and armies , which he expected to share with pompey on account of his connection with him , urged on scipio ; and moreover he was influenced by the fear of being called to trial , and the adulation and an ostentatious display of himself and his friends in power , who at that time had great influence in the republic , and courts of judicature . 
 only dare to look up , and cease to tremble at the empty names of legions
 messala continued far from obscure are the causes which you seek neither to yourself or to our friends , secundus and aper , are they unknown , though you assign me the part of speaking out before you what we all think
 was it , forsooth , her beauty and her ancestors , with their triumphal honours , that failed to please , or her being a mother , and her sincere heart
 his chief motive was fear that germanicus , who had at his disposal so many legions , such vast auxiliary forces of the allies , and such wonderful popularity , might prefer the possession to the expectation of empire
 with barbarians , indecision is a slave's weakness
 a part even of this space , which reaches to the fortress , being fortified by the nature of the country , and a very deep valley , required a long and difficult siege . 
 there were no ships , no provisions at hand , and the camp , which was situated on low ground , was in process of being carried away by the force of the stream
 they had huge frames , and lances long enough to inflict wounds even at a distance
this the helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined together .
 no hearing before the senate was granted him
 what legions indeed are these against us
 i should not mention a very trivial decree of the senate which allowed the city of syracuse to exceed the prescribed number in their gladiatorial shows , had not paetus thrasea spoken against it and furnished his traducers with a ground for censuring his motion
they often engage in resolutions concerning the most important matters , induced by these reports and stories alone ; of which they must necessarily instantly repent , since they yield to mere unauthorized reports ; and since most people give to their questions answers framed agreeably to their wishes .
 he inflamed their excitement by weeping and smiting his breast and face with his hands
 titus , after surveying the treasures , the royal presents , and the other objects which the antiquarian tendencies of the greek arbitrarily connect with some uncertain past , first consulted the oracle about his voyage
 cerialis spoke of the old glory of the roman name , of former and of recent victories
 and annius gallus , who a few days before had been seriously injured by the fall of his horse , was reported to agree by those who had been sent to ascertain his opinion
 he , in the belief that this was rejoicing , rewarded with impunity the prompt informations of antonius natalis and cervarius proculus
 once our native-born citizens sufficed for peoples of our own kin , and we are by no means dissatisfied with the rome of the past
 when they perceived this , they altered their plan , and set fire to barrels , filled with resin and tar , and rolled them down from the wall on the musculus . 
 had not paullinus on hearing of the outbreak in the province rendered prompt succour , britain would have been lost by one successful engagement , he brought it back to its former obedience , though many , troubled by the conscious guilt of rebellion and by particular dread of the legate , still clung to their arms
labienus , having learned the design of the enemy , hoping that through their rashness there would be some opportunity of engaging , after leaving a guard of five cohorts for the baggage , advances against the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large body of cavalry , and , leaving the space of a mile between them , fortifies his camp .
 and the prefects and tribunes , with similar language , stimulated the ardour of the troops
 thereupon all stood paralysed , and gazed at each other in amazement , panic-stricken by the very fact that there was no one to direct them
 now at last our spirit is returning
 even war is a good exchange for a miserable peace
 thus encouraged , he made an attempt on the island of mona , as a place from which the rebels drew reinforcements
 already , at the pleasure of the commander of the guards , a camp had been established
 in fact , he had thereby sought to sow the seeds of civil war and revolt from the house of the caesars
 it was agreed that the legions should be released from the blockade , that all the troops should quit armenian territory , and that the forts and supplies should be surrendered to the parthians , and when all this had been completed , vologeses was to have full permission to send envoys to nero
the battle was long and vigorously contested , since the sotiates , relying on their former victories , imagined that the safety of the whole of aquitania rested on their valor ; our men , on the other hand , desired it might be seen what they could accomplish without their general and without the other legions , under a very young commander ; at length the enemy , worn out with wounds , began to turn their backs , and a great number of them being slain , crassus began to besiege the town of the sotiates on his march .
ariovistus then demanded that they should confer on horseback , and that , besides themselves , they should bring with them ten men each to the conference .
 the victories won by orators and poets would furnish a stimulus to genius , and it could not be a burden for any judge to bestow his attention on graceful pursuits or on legitimate recreations
 i have mentioned before that julianus was in command of the gladiators , apollinaris of the seamen , two men whose profligacy and indolence made them resemble gladiators rather than generals
the day following , caesar left what seemed sufficient as a guard for both camps ; drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the enemy , before the lesser camp , because he was not very powerful in the number of legionary soldiers , considering the number of the enemy ; that he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance .
 it was then decided , after a discussion of religious questions , that the institution of the priests of jupiter should remain unchanged
 he intrusted the affair to blaesus , who was to hold out to the other rebels the prospect of laying down their arms without hurt to themselves , while he was by any means to secure the person of the chief
 meanwhile envoys from the senate had an interview with germanicus , who had now returned , at the altar of the ubii
there he receives intelligence of the death of clodius ; and , being informed of the decree of the senate , that all the youth of italy should take the military oath , he determined to hold a levy throughout the entire province .
 i must now speak of the suevi , who are not one nation as are the chatti and tencteri , for they occupy the greater part of germany , and have hitherto been divided into separate tribes with names of their own , though they are called by the general designation of suevi
 their shields are black , their bodies dyed
 the city populace indeed suffered much from high prices , but this was no fault of the emperor , who actually endeavoured to counteract barren soils and stormy seas with every resource of wealth and foresight
when he had arrived there , he discovered that those things , which he had suspected would occur , had taken place ; that embassies had been sent to the germans by some of the states , and that they had been entreated to leave the rhine , and had been promised that all things which they desired should be provided by the gauls .
 caecina , who commanded a division of his own , was advised , though he was returning by a route which he knew , to pass long bridges with all possible speed
 the massilians , wearied out by misfortunes of every sort , reduced to the lowest ebb for want of corn , conquered in two engagements at sea , defeated in their frequent sallies , and struggling moreover with a fatal pestilence , from their long confinement and change of victuals for they all subsisted on old millet and damaged barley , which they had formerly provided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency of this kind , their turret being demolished , a great part of their wall having given way , and despairing of any aid , either from the provinces or their armies , for these they had heard had fallen into caesar's power , resolved to surrender now without dissimulation . 
 the best proof of the victory was seen in the enemy's general valentinus , who with undaunted courage shewed in his look his habitual high spirit
in the mean while scouts having been sent in all directions , he examines by what most convenient path he might cross the valley .
 alarmed at this declaration , attius varus drew out of the town the garrison which he had introduced , and fled . 
 but some , remembering their recent victory , stood their ground and struck fiercely at the foe , now encouraging each other and their neighbours , and now , while they re-formed their lines , imploring the besieged not to lose the opportunity
when caesar inquired of his prisoners , wherefore ariovistus did not come to an engagement , he discovered this to be the reason-that among the germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and divination , whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not ; that they had said , that it was not the will of heaven that the germans should conquer , if they engaged in battle before the new moon .
to the extraordinary valor of our soldiers , devices of every sort were opposed by the gauls ; since they are a nation of consummate ingenuity , and most skillful in imitating and making those things which are imparted by any one ; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses , and when they had caught hold of them firmly , drew them on by means of engines , and undermined the mound the more skillfully on this account , because there are in their territories extensive iron mines , and consequently every description of mining operations is known and practiced by them .
 then in utter perplexity he returned to the palace
 by this movement they were hemmed in on all sides , and the whole force would have perished , had not the shades of night checked the advance of the victorious army , and covered the retreat of the vanquished
 but our men being contented to retreat without injury , having killed several of the enemy , and lost but five of their own , very quietly retired , and having seized some other hills somewhat on this side of that place , completed their fortifications . 
 he was altogether without harshness , pride , or the greed of gain
 others , again , assign a very distinguished origin to the jews , alleging that they were the solymi , a nation celebrated in the poems of homer , who called the city which they founded hierosolyma after their own name
 hence , he said , i do not take refuge in an answer which it would be easy to return , that livia can herself decide whether she considers that , after drusus , she ought again to marry or rather to endure life in the same home , and that she has in her mother and grandmother counsellors nearer and dearer to her
 caesar , without disregarding the information , declined an interview , for the communication , he said , might be conveyed to him through the same messenger , flaccus
 i take no individual as an instance
 the first disturbance was checked only by a second
 tullius flavianus , commanding a squadron , was taken prisoner
 rufus by the teachings of philosophy cluvidienus quietus , julius agrippa , blitius catulinus , petronius priscus , julius altinus , mere rank and file , so to say , had islands in the aegean sea assigned to them
 having sailed round britain and lost their vessels from not knowing how to manage them , they were looked upon as pirates and were intercepted , first by the suevi and then by the frisii
 on learning his arrival , pompey , to prevent his being hemmed in between two armies , quitted his position , and went with all his forces to asparagium , in the territory of dyrrachium , and there encamped in a convenient situation . 
 the games of ceres were attended as usual
 they had actually undertaken to sink a navigable canal from the lake avernus to the mouths of the tiber along a barren shore or through the face of hills , where one meets with no moisture which could supply water , except the pomptine marshes
 it was characteristic of tiberius to veil new devices in wickedness under ancient names
 next , lucius arruntius , who differed but little from the speech of gallus , gave like offence , though tiberius had no old grudge against him , but simply mistrusted him , because he was rich and daring , had brilliant accomplishments , and corresponding popularity
 in expectation of this he led three legions out of the camp , and , drawing up his army in an advantageous position , he ordered the advanced men of one legion to hasten forward and seize the eminence . 
 the batavi provoking a conflict , the struggle was at once begun by all the boldest spirits among our troops , but a panic arose , when they saw arms and horses swallowed up in the vast depths of the marshes
 they did not consider that the smallness of our numbers , and the disadvantage of the place and the confined nature of the ground occasioned by their having first possessed themselves of the camp , and the double danger both from within and without the fortifications , and the separation of the army into two parts , so that the one could not give relief to the other , were the causes of our defeat . 
 a host of locusts , suddenly appearing , had devoured every blade of grass and every leaf and so , hiding his fear and presenting a more conciliatory attitude , he replied that he would send envoys to the roman emperor for the possession of armenia and the conclusion of a lasting peace
when he had proceeded three days' journey , word was brought to him that ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on vesontio , which is the largest town of the sequani , and had advanced three days' journey from its territories .
 how near was the step of declaring the stranger a colleague ! ambition at first had a steep path before it
 they were joined by the singularian horse , which had been raised some time before by vitellius , and had afterwards gone over to the side of vespasian
 it will be for you to consider which fact weighs most with you , that she is with child by arminius or that she owes her being to me
 by this time more temperate language was heard throughout the camp , and the tribunes and centurions , mixing with the troops , suggested commendations of the prudence of their general in selecting for the rallying point and basis of his operations a colony rich in military strength and resources
 so octavia was betrothed , and domitius , besides his previous relationship , became now the emperor's affianced son-in-law , and an equal of britannicus , through the exertions of his mother and the cunning of those who had been the accusers of messalina , and feared the vengeance of her son
 then , when seemingly about to go , and she was fearing nothing , he stabbed her with the steel , and having wounded and scared away the slave girl who was hurrying to her , rushed out of the chamber
 the letters antonius , the harangues of brutus contain reproaches against augustus , false indeed , but urged with powerful sarcasm
 still , neither of them would visit rome or even the neighbourhood of rome
 in the very ranks of the enemy we shall find our own forces britons will acknowledge their own cause
 the germans were flushed with success
 he was heard , but only that they might judge of his character and he was condemned during his execution he replied to one who taunted him with the subjection of his country , that i take as my consolation in death
 all this was done either without the knowledge , or against the commands of vespasian he gave orders that the army should halt at aquileia and there await mucianus and these orders he supported by the argument , that as aegypt , which commanded the corn supplies , and the revenues of the wealthiest provinces were in his hands , the army of vitellius would be compelled to capitulate from the want of pay and provisions
 plebeian magistrates came after patrician
 when stratagem proved ineffectual , he resorted to force , arranging in distinct columns the canninefates , the batavians , and the frisii
 the popular gossip of the large majority fastened itself variously on their future masters
 then , repenting of his resolve , and finding that the very men who had advised it now disapproved it , he seemed bent on pursuing the enemy , and wrote to herennius gallus , legate of the first legion , who was then holding bonna , that he was to prevent the batavians from crossing the rhine , and that he would himself hang on their rear with his army
 his right wing was secured by a river with steep banks ; for which reason he placed all his cavalry , archers , and slingers , on his left wing . 
 so fabianus , with the persons whom i have named and some others less distinguished , executed the will
 cestius proculus was acquitted of extortion , his accusers dropping the charge
 it is the singularly unfair peculiarity of war that the credit of success is claimed by all , while a disaster is attributed to one alone
 report , however , has uniformly asserted , that valens himself was bought with a vast sum
 the scheme was betrayed to the othonianist generals , and paullinus assumed the command of the infantry , celsus of the cavalry
 he reported this to the senate , and as soon as judges had been appointed , urgulania , the grandmother of silvanus , sent her grandson a dagger
 even as it was , the camp-prefect , with eight centurions , and the bravest of the soldiers , were slain
 pompeia macrina too was sentenced to banishment her husband argolicus and her father-in-law laco , leading men of achaia , had been ruined by the emperor
 they were intent on war
 the soldiers were mingled in the darkness as accident had determined
caesar readily grants them pardon , and receives their excuse , at the request of the aedui , because he thought that the summer season was one for an impending war , not for an investigation .
 that prince , among other secrets of imperial policy , had forbidden senators and roman knights of the higher rank to enter egypt except by permission , and he had specially reserved the country , from a fear that any one who held a province containing the key of the land and of the sea , with ever so small a force against the mightiest army , might distress italy by famine
their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art ; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships .
 but who walks by his side or attends his receptions or follows in his train
 only thus far and here rumour seems truth does the world extend
 a terrible vision then appeared to scydrothemis , warning him to thwart no longer the purposes of the god
 still the policy of mercy prevailed
 quite different is their faith about things divine
 if there is any dwelling-place for the spirits of the just if , as the wise believe , noble souls do not perish with the body , rest thou in peace and call us , thy family , from weak regrets and womanish laments to the contemplation of thy virtues , for which we must not weep nor beat the breast
the enemy following up their success with a very loud shout , as if victory were already obtained and secured , began to advance their towers and mantelets , and climb the rampart with ladders .
 the crowd replied that they had delivered their instructions to clemens , one of the centurions , which he was to convey to rome
 it was to the forum that they chiefly directed their steps , anxious to behold the spot where galba had fallen
 soon all the neighbours in their excitement at the report were bewailing brothers , kinsmen or parents
 when the accused denied this , it was decided that his slaves who recognised the writing should be examined by torture
 but , cunningly enough , it was as a stranger that laco supported him , and the high character of piso gave weight to his advice
 valens , disguised in the garb of a slave , found concealment with a subaltern officer of cavalry
 late in the day he entered the entrenchments , and found himself the centre of a mob of clamorous and mutinous fugitives
 the emperor by an edict forbade any magistrate or procurator in the government of a province to exhibit a show of gladiators , or of wild beasts , or indeed any other public entertainment
 his slaves too were sold by auction to the state-agent , to be examined by torture and that not a friend might help him in his danger , charges of treason were added , a binding guarantee for sealed lips
 if soundness is all that you can praise him for , he is not very far from being an invalid
 but as they refused to fight against the power of the roman people , and as the citizens made a spontaneous attempt to admit caesar , despairing of any assistance , he threw open the gates , and surrendered himself and the town to caesar , and was preserved safe from injury by him . 
in the mean time they ordered their people to return to the country parts , and the chiefs assembled from all quarter , and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to caesar .
 after this he was greater than ever , and though his counsels were ruinous , he was listened to with confidence , as a man who had no care for himself
 indeed , many conflicting thoughts troubled him
 let the lessons of fortune in both its forms teach you not to prefer rebellion and ruin to submission and safety
 john , also called bargioras , occupied the middle city
 the capital had been embellished on a grand scale
 in that part of britain which looks towards ireland , he posted some troops , hoping for fresh conquests rather than fearing attack , inasmuch as ireland , being between britain and spain and conveniently situated for the seas round gaul , might have been the means of connecting with great mutual benefit the most powerful parts of the empire
 meanwhile his house was surrounded with soldiers they crowded noisily even about the entrance , so that they could be heard and seen when libo , whose anguish drove him from the very banquet he had prepared as his last gratification , called for a minister of death , grasped the hands of his slaves , and thrust a sword into them
 the centurions and tribunes were spurned away that no man's voice might be heard , the troops clashed their weapons together , ready to break through all discipline , unless they were led as they wished
 unquestionably , they could not extricate themselves from the charge of extortion the whole affair however was conducted as a trial for treason , and silius forestalled impending doom by a self-inflicted death
therefore , having made very long marches by day and night , he came to the river loire , contrary to the expectation of all ; and having by means of the cavalry , found out a ford , suitable enough considering the emergency , of such depth that their arms and shoulders could be above water for supporting their accoutrements , he dispersed his cavalry in such a manner as to break the force of the current , and having confounded the enemy at the first sight , led his army across the river in safety ; and finding corn and cattle in the fields , after refreshing his army with them , he determined to march into the country of the senones .
 even if the gates were wide open , we ought not to enter the place , except we had first reconnoitred it , and in the day-time
 a noble answer , by which tiberius sought to liken himself to those generals of old who had forbidden and even denounced the poisoning of king pyrrhus
 the loose ranks were at once broken , and , entangled as they were among their wagons and artillery , could not be re-formed
some propose that , forming a wedge , they suddenly break through , since the camp was so near ; and if any part should be surrounded and slain , they fully trust that at least the rest may be saved ; others , that they take their stand on an eminence , and all undergo the same destiny .
 agrippina too was honoured with the title of augusta
disappointed in this hope , the nervii surround the winter-quarters with a rampart eleven feet high , and a ditch thirteen feet in depth .
 he was also appointed adviser to caius caesar in the government of armenia , and had likewise paid court to tiberius , who was then at rhodes
 trio , abandoning the prosecution on this count , obtained leave to accuse piso's previous career , and the emperor was requested to undertake the inquiry
 so impetuous were the efforts of the army that within a third part of one day the walls were stripped of their defenders , the barriers of the gates overthrown , the fortifications scaled and captured , and all the adult inhabitants massacred , without the loss of a soldier and with but very few wounded
 caesar commited me , whom he considered his dearest friend , and the provinces of sicily and africa , without which he was not able to protect rome or italy , to your protection . 
 these the generals allowed to be plundered
at the same time he was informed by publius crassus , whom he had sent with one legion against the veneti , the venelli , the osismi , the coriosolitae , the esuvii , the aulerci , and the redones , which are maritime states , and touch upon the ocean , that all these nations were brought under the dominion and power of the roman people .
 in the mean time , word was brought to caesar that the people of sulmo , a town about seven miles distant from corfinium , were ready to obey his orders , but were prevented by quintus lucretius , a senator , and attius , a pelignian , who were in possession of the town with a garrison of seven cohorts . 
 most argued in favour of a safe course , saying that any crime in a foreign country was to be welcomed with joy , and that the seeds of strife ought to be actually sown , on the very principle on which roman emperors had often under a show of generosity given away this same kingdom of armenia to excite the minds of the barbarians rhadamistus might retain his ill-gotten gains , as long as he was hated and infamous
 was the murderer , as some do not blush to pretend , avenging his wrongs because he had bargained about money from his father or because a family-slave was taken from him
 and , besides , the defendant offered his slaves to the torture , and insisted on its application to the attendants on that occasion
 this was granted , and he spoke as follows 
gaius arpineius , a roman knight , the intimate friend of quintus titurius , and with him , quintus junius , a certain person from spain , who already on previous occasions , had been accustomed to go to ambiorix , at caesar's mission , is sent to them for the purpose of a conference : before them ambiorix spoke to this effect : that he confessed , that for caesar's kindness toward him , he was very much indebted to him , inasmuch as by his aid he had been freed from a tribute which he had been accustomed to pay to the aduatuci , his neighbors ; and because his own son and the son of his brother had been sent back to him , whom , when sent in the number of hostages , the aduatuci had detained among them in slavery and in chains ; and that he had not done that which he had done in regard to the attacking of the camp , either by his own judgment or desire , but by the compulsion of his state ; and that his government was of that nature , that the people had as much authority over him as he over the people .
 wives actually pregnant , and tender children were added to gotarzes' victims , while , slothful at home and unsuccessful in war , he made cruelty a screen for his feebleness
 thus far we have taken note of western germany
 then followed every variety of conflict the parthians , accustomed to pursue or fly with equal science , deployed their squadrons , and sought scope for their missiles the sarmatae , throwing aside their bows , which at a shorter range are effective , rushed on with pikes and swords
for as all the corn was reaped in every part with the exception of one , the enemy , suspecting that our men would repair to that , had concealed themselves in the woods during the night .
 accordingly , caesar dispatching couriers , writes to domitius , and acquaints him with his wishes on the subject : and having stationed a garrison of four cohorts at apollonia , one at lissus , and three at oricum , besides those who were sick of their wounds , he set forward on his march through epirus and acarnania . 
 and , strange to relate , two columns of the enemy fled in opposite directions , that , which had occupied the wood , rushing into the open , those who had been drawn up on the plains , into the wood
 decimus silanus , the paramour of the granddaughter of augustus , though the only severity he experienced was exclusion from the emperor's friendship , saw clearly that it meant exile and it was not till tiberius's reign that he ventured to appeal to the senate and to the prince , in reliance on the influence of his brother marcus silanus , who was conspicuous both for his distinguished rank and eloquence
 so germanicus , with increased energy , advanced into the country , laying it waste , and utterly ruining a foe who dared not encounter him , or who was instantly defeated wherever he resisted , and , as we learnt from prisoners , was never more panic-stricken
 some he relieved by the remission of tribute , others by exemptions
 if however he were to seek a successor outside of his house , he feared that the memory of augustus and the name of the caesars would become a laughing-stock and a scorn
 victories over the foreigner taught us how to waste the substance of others victories over ourselves , how to squander our own what a paltry matter is this of which the aediles are reminding us ! what a mere trifle if you look at everything else ! no one represents to the senate that italy requires supplies from abroad , and that the very existence of the people of rome is daily at the mercy of uncertain waves and storms
 the murderers of galba were the most ardent promoters of mutiny and discord
 twelve squadrons of cavalry and some picked infantry advanced against the enemy they were reinforced by a cohort of ligurians , an auxiliary local force of long standing , and five hundred pannonians , not yet regularly enrolled
that this was easy , because neither would the legions , in the absence of their general , dare to leave their winter quarters , nor could the general reach his army without a guard : finally , that it was better to be slain in battle , than not to recover their ancient glory in war , and that freedom which they had received from their forefathers .
 yet arminius , though free to attack , did not at the moment rush out on them
 thus , that the parties on both sides inclined to mercy : that the generals only were averse to peace : that they paid no regard to the laws either of conference or truce ; and had most inhumanly put to death ignorant persons , who were deceived by a conference : that therefore , they had met that fate which usually befalls men from excessive obstinacy and arrogance ; and were obliged to have recourse , and most earnestly desire that which they had shortly before disdained . 
 as an ancient statute of the senate forbade such inquiry in a case affecting a master's life , tiberius , with his cleverness in devising new law , ordered libo's slaves to be sold singly to the state-agent , so that , forsooth , without an infringement of the senate's decree , libo might be tried on their evidence
many things persuaded the gauls to this measure ; the delay of sabinus during the previous days ; the positive assertion of the deserter ; want of provisions , for a supply of which they had not taken the requisite precautions ; the hope springing from the venetic war ; and because in most cases men willingly believe what they wish .
caesar thought that further additions should be made to these works , in order that the fortifications might be defensible by a small number of soldiers .
 at a stated period , all the tribes of the same race assemble by their representatives in a grove consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers , and by immemorial associations of terror here , having publicly slaughtered a human victim , they celebrate the horrible beginning of their barbarous rite
 these the common soldiers paid as a kind of annual tribute
 the emperor willingly complied with the flatteries of the senate who wished nero to enter on the consulship in his twentieth year , and meanwhile , as consul-elect , to have pro-consular authority beyond the limits of the capital with the title of prince of the youth of rome
 it was , however , stated in the notes of the proceedings furnished to the senate that macro had superintended the examination of the witnesses and the torture of the slaves , and the fact that there was no letter from the emperor against the defendants caused a suspicion that , while he was very feeble and possibly ignorant of the matter , the charge was to a great extent invented to gratify macro's well-known enmity against arruntius
 he was now approaching the neighbourhood of seleucia with a large force , while tiridates , dismayed by the rumour and then by the king's presence in person , was divided in mind , and doubted whether he should march against him or prolong the war by delay
 by hastening my end i earn the clemency of the conqueror
 thither came lucius caesar , a young man , whose father was a lieutenant-general under caesar . 
 the horse , which he had detached , crossed the ford , and when afranius and petreius had broken up their camp about the third watch , they suddenly appeared on their rear , and spreading round them in great numbers , retard and impede their march . 
 there was indeed a young man of much the same age , whom some of the emperor's freedmen pretended to recognise , and to whom they attached themselves with a treacherous intent
 their first act was to cut to pieces a cohort , which had been sent on in advance by sextilius felix soon afterwards , however , on the approach of the roman generals at the head of their army , they returned to their duty by an act of honourable desertion , and the triboci , vangiones , and caeracates , followed their example
 and having there learned the loss he had sustained , and perceiving that pompey had forced our works , and had encamped along the coast , so that he was at liberty to forage , and had a communication with his shipping , he altered his plan for conducting the war , as his design had not succeeded , and ordered a strong encampment to be made near pompey . 
 when these affairs were dispatched , caesar , that there might be an intermission from labor for the rest of the season , drew off his soldiers to the nearest municipal towns , and set off in person for rome . 
caesar , on observing these movements , sends labienus with six cohorts to relieve his distressed soldiers : he orders him , if he should be unable to withstand them , to draw off the cohorts and make a sally ; but not to do this except through necessity .
 despatches were sent to the 14th legion in britain and to the 1st in spain , for both these legions had been on the side of otho against vitellius
 yet the divine julius , the divine augustus themselves bore all this and let it pass , whether in forbearance or in wisdom i cannot easily say
 a similar movement was made from caesar's camp . 
 this he thought the most likely method to remove and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt , the usual consequence of civil wars and dissensions , and to support the credit of the debtors . 
 they recollected too that they had suffered an alarming scarcity at alesia , and a much greater at avaricum , and yet had returned victorious over mighty nations . 
 an engagement taking place there with caesar's advanced-guard , domitius's men were quickly beaten off from the bridge and retreated precipitately into the town . 
 rufus , who had long been a common soldier , then a centurion , and subsequently camp-prefect , tried to revive the old severe discipline , inured as he was to work and toil , and all the sterner because he had endured
 this he would remind people was a royal custom , and had been the practice of ancient chiefs
 all have fierce blue eyes , red hair , huge frames , fit only for a sudden exertion
on reconnoitering the situation of the city , finding that the enemy were panic-stricken , because the cavalry in which they placed their chief reliance , were beaten , he encouraged his men to endure the toil , and began to draw a line of circumvallation round alesia .
that business having been speedily executed , he again led his legions back into winter-quarters .
the gauls being intimidated by fear of this , lest the passes should be pre-occupied by the roman cavalry , desisted from their design .
 when all who were present , wept and bitterly complained , thrasea urged them to hasten their departure and not mingle their own perils with the fate of a doomed man arria , too , who aspired to follow her husband's end and the example of arria , her mother , he counselled to preserve her life , and not rob the daughter of their love of her only stay
 for you are mistaken , sejanus , if you think that you will then remain in the same position , and that livia , who has been the wife of caius caesar and afterwards of drusus , will have the inclination to pass her old age with a mere roman knight
 the temple resembled a citadel , and had its own walls , which were more laboriously constructed than the others
 it is , however , beyond dispute that in consequence of some dream , whatever it was , both the man and his brother perished
though the suevi , after making the attempt frequently and in several wars , could not expel this nation from their territories , on account of the extent and population of their state , yet they made them tributaries , and rendered them less distinguished and powerful .
 in the mean time some of them invite their acquaintances , and bring them to their camp , others are brought away by their friends , so that the two camps seemed to be united into one , and several of the tribunes and centurions came to caesar , and paid their respects to him . 
 antonius did not press forward , for he thought of the fatigue and the wounds with which a battle so hard fought , notwithstanding its successful termination , must have disabled his cavalry and their horses as the shadows of evening deepened the whole strength of the flavianist army came up they advanced amid heaps of dead and the traces of recent slaughter , and , as if the war was over , demanded that they should advance to cremona , and receive the capitulation of the vanquished party , or take the place by storm
 heedless of men , heedless of gods , they have attained that hardest of results , the not needing so much as a wish
 as he was returning from the command of the legion , vespasian admitted him into the patrician order , and then gave him the province of aquitania , a preeminently splendid appointment both from the importance of its duties and the prospect of the consulate to which the emperor destined him
 about the same time asia and achaia were alarmed by a prevalent but short-lived rumour that drusus , the son of germanicus , had been seen in the cyclades and subsequently on the mainland
 gotarzes , among his many cruelties , had caused the death of his brother artabanus , with his wife and son hence his people feared for themselves and sent for vardanes
 again , when divine honours were decreed to poppaea , he was purposely absent and did not attend her funeral
with them arose the beginning by their detaining silius and velanius ; for they thought that they should recover by their means the hostages which they had given to crassus .
 some in their ignominious flight climbed the tops of trees , and as they were hiding themselves in the boughs , archers were brought up and they were shot for sport
 this distinction in punishment means that crime , they think , ought , in being punished , to be exposed , while infamy ought to be buried out of sight
caesar , on learning these proceedings from the deserters and captives , adopted the following system of fortification ; he dug a trench twenty feet deep , with perpendicular sides , in such a manner that the base of this trench should extend so far as the edges were apart at the top .
lucius fabius a centurion of the eighth legion , who , it was ascertained , had said that day among his fellow soldiers that he was excited by the plunder of avaricum , and would not allow any one to mount the wall before him , finding three men of his own company , and being raised up by them , scaled the wall .
 you should yourselves bear in mind that , whenever men are accused of extortion , most of the charges are directed against the wives
 others showed him their limbs bowed with age
 and so , although their advice was asked on totally different subjects , they decreed an altar to clemency , an altar to friendship , and statues round them to caesar and sejanus , both of whom they earnestly begged with repeated entreaties to allow themselves to be seen in public
 at the same moment the tribunes and the centurions convinced them that it was a false alarm
while those things are carried on at alesia , the gauls , having convened a council of their chief nobility , determine that all who could bear arms should not be called out , which was the opinion of vercingetorix , but that a fixed number should be levied from each state ; lest , when so great a multitude assembled together , they could neither govern nor distinguish their men , nor have the means of supplying them with corn .
on the second day , when he came to vellaunodunum , a town of the senones , he determined to attack it , in order that he might not leave an enemy in his rear , and might the more easily procure supplies of provisions , and draw a line of circumvallation around it in two days : on the third day , embassadors being sent from the town to treat of a capitulation , he orders their arms to be brought together , their cattle to be brought forth , and six hundred hostages to be given .
 and yet in past days italy used to send supplies for the legions into distant provinces , and even now it is not a barren soil which causes distress but we prefer to cultivate africa and egypt , and trust the life of the roman people to ships and all their risks
 after a short debate on either side , it was brought to this issue : that those who had any settlement or possession in spain , should be immediately discharged : the rest at the river var . 
 that he was not sent back , and that he was even impeached , they regarded as an accusation against themselves
they demand thirty-five thousand men from the aedui and their dependents , the segusiani , ambivareti , and aulerci brannovices ; an equal number from the arverni in conjunction with the eleuteti cadurci , gabali , and velauni , who were accustomed to be under the command of the arverni ; twelve thousand each from the senones , sequani , bituriges , sentones , ruteni , and carnutes ; ten thousand from the bellovaci ; the same number from the lemovici ; eight thousand each from the pictones , and turoni , and parisii , and helvii ; five thousand each from the suessiones , ambiani , mediomatrici , petrocorii , nervii , morini , and nitiobriges ; the same number from the aulerci cenomani ; four thousand from the atrebates ; three thousand each from the bellocassi , lexovii , and aulerci eburovices ; thirty thousand from the rauraci , and boii ; six thousand from all the states together , which border on the atlantic , and which in their dialect are called armoricae .
 and now the fidelity of the rest of the party was weakened by their fears
 disgusted with the prospect of the future , they acquiesced in their present condition
 the affection of the province to caesar proved so great and so favorable , that he received a letter from gades , before he was far advanced on his march : that as soon as the nobility of gades heard of caesar's proclamation , they had combined with the tribune of the cohorts , which were in garrison there , to drive gallonius out of the town , and to secure the city and island for caesar . 
 at this moment galba has but one half-armed cohort , which is detaining , not defending him
thus they display in battle the speed of horse , the firmness of infantry ; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed , even on a declining and steep place , to check their horses at full speed , and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole , and stand on the yoke , and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again .
 the place of sacrifice is served only with prayers and pure flame , and though it stands in the open air , it is never wet with rain
 she would enter the capitol in a chariot , a practice , which being allowed of old only to the priests and sacred images , increased the popular reverence for a woman who up to this time was the only recorded instance of one who , an emperor's daughter , was sister , wife , and mother of a sovereign
 assuredly tiberius was not saved by his elevation or his solitude from having to confess the anguish of his heart and his self-inflicted punishment
 thus he entered the capital , and he there embraced his mother and honoured her with the title of augusta
he orders them all to seek the same quarter by a long circuit ; these proceedings were seen at a distance from the town , as gergovia commanded a view of the camp , nor could the gauls ascertain at so great a distance , what certainty there was in the maneuver .
caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence , because he had always especially indulged the state of the aedui , and , without any hesitation , draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all the cavalry : nor had he time , at such a crisis , to contract the camp , because the affair seemed to depend upon dispatch .
 his productions are as empty and ephemeral as they are replete with folly nothing serious or alarming is to be apprehended from the man who is the betrayer of his own shame and works on the imaginations not of men but of silly women
but of these two orders , one is that of the druids , the other that of the knights .
 ever ready for daring achievements , vardanes traversed 375 miles in two days , and drove before him the surprised and terrified gotarzes
 it was resolved that these troops should be sent back to britain , from which province nero had summoned them , and that the batavian cohorts should in the meantime be quartered with them , because there was an old feud between them and the 14th in the presence of such animosities between these armed masses , harmony did not last long
 evidence of this is sought in the name
 meanwhile on hearing of her arrival , all her intimate friends and several officers , every one indeed who had served under germanicus , many strangers too from the neighbouring towns , some thinking it respectful to the emperor , and still more following their example , thronged eagerly to brundisium , the nearest and safest landing place for a voyager
 the border population , however , value gold and silver for their commercial utility , and are familiar with , and show preference for , some of our coins the tribes of the interior use the simpler and more ancient practice of the barter of commodities they like the old and well-known money , coins milled , or showing a two-horse chariot
 pay cannot be furnished without tribute
 these were despatched in all directions and it having been ascertained that the track of the flying enemy was uncertain , and that there was no attempt at rallying , it being also impossible , as summer was now over , to extend the war , agricola led back his army into the territory of the boresti
 no one in the whole house cares what he says or does before his infant master
 meanwhile , without any evident cause , the statue of victory at camulodunum fell prostrate and turned its back to the enemy , as though it fled before them
 an aged emperor may indeed shrink from the citizen's gaze , and plead the weariness of declining years and the toils of the past
 if i were a private man , and were now adopting you by the act of the curiae before the pontiffs , as our custom is , it would be a high honour to me to introduce into my family a descendant of cn pompeius and m
 as soon as they were ready , he exhorted his soldiers , and told them of what advantage it would be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries , if they made themselves masters of a rich and plentiful town : and , at the same time to strike terror into other states by the example of this , and to effect this with speed , before auxiliaries could arrive . 
 again were they driven back
 and therefore , when our men were oppressed in every manner , and were scarcely able to make resistance , the defect in our works was observed , and pompey's soldiers , landing between the two ramparts , where the work was unfinished , attacked our men in the rear , and having beat them from both sides of the fortification , obliged them to flee . 
 to accuse either gods or men is only for him who wishes to live
 nero , the same year , established a gymnasium , where oil was furnished to knights and senators after the lax fashion of the greeks
 we have blundered enough by our tameness for so many years , in having to endure thirty or forty campaigns till we grow old , most of us with bodies maimed by wounds
 the name germany , on the other hand , they say , is modern and newly introduced , from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the rhine and drove out the gauls , and are now called tungrians , were then called germans
 such was the character of the district , full of hidden perils from the varying depth of the fords , and unfavourable to our troops
the enemy having been dislodged by their valor , a part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their expectations ; a part perished , surrounded by the barbarians .
 italy , however , was prostrated under sufferings heavier and more terrible than the evils of war
 on their admitting that they had not done so , can any hands , he answered , break through and undermine walls with swords and lances
 on hearing that caecina had been repulsed , and was making his way to cremona , though the legion could hardly be restrained , and in its eagerness for action , even went to the length of open mutiny , he halted at bedriacum
 tiberius remembering this service , while he alleged other reasons , deprecated a sentence of exile , but did not oppose his expulsion from the senate
 nevertheless vitellius summoned auxiliary troops from germany , britain , and spain , tardily , however , and with an attempt to conceal his necessities
 the same was done by some of the nobility of spain , whom they summoned to their assistance , and kept in their camp as hostages . 
 this was thought equivalent to a hint from the emperor , because of the known intimacy between augusta and urgulania
caesar appointed over each legion a legate and a quaestor , that every one might have them as witnesses of his valor .
 these were the eighth and seventh claudius' , who were possessed with a strong liking for otho , though they had not been present at the battle of bedriacum
 having been appointed by galba to command the 7th legion , he was commonly believed to have often written to otho , offering the party his services as a general
 his ideas and his style were grand
 should posterity wish to know something of his appearance , it was graceful rather than commanding
 even the proclamation by which he summoned the senators to their chamber , he issued merely with the title of tribune , which he had received under augustus
 why not rather , if the frailty of my youth goes in any respect astray , call me back and guide yet more zealously with your help the manhood which you have instructed
 they were being pushed into a swamp , well known to the victorious assailants , perilous to men unacquainted with it , when caesar led forth his legions in battle array
 nor did civilis marshal his army in silence
 hispo added that marcellus had placed his own statue above those of the caesars , and had set the bust of tiberius on another statue from which he had struck off the head of augustus
 and being apprehensive for domitius , lest he should be surprised by pompey's arrival , he hastened with all speed and earnestness to join him ; for he planned the operations of the whole campaign on these principles : that if pompey should march after him , he would be drawn off from the sea , and from those forces which he had provided in dyrrachium , and separated from his corn and magazines , and be obliged to carry on the war on equal terms ; but if he crossed over into italy , caesar , having effected a junction with domitius , would march through illyricum to the relief of italy ; but if he endeavored to storm apollonia and oricum , and exclude him from the whole coast , he hoped , by besieging scipio , to oblige him , of necessity , to come to his assistance . 
 the man still was admired , still retained his high reputation , but they hated him with the hatred of those who are despised
 the acclamations and cries which habitual flattery prompted in the people were at once extravagant and false
 antonius returned the same day on which he had set out with the cohorts and attius . 
ariovistus all this time kept his army in camp : but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes .
 and it is an infamy and a reproach for life to have survived the chief , and returned from the field
 besides , cerialis was not cautious , and might easily be intercepted , as the multiplicity of tidings hurried him from place to place
 the auxiliaries were dispersed in every part of the field
 marcellinus , being informed of this disorder , detached some cohorts to the relief of our men , who seeing them flee from the camp , were neither able to persuade them to rally at their approach , nor themselves to sustain the enemy's charge . 
 soon afterwards , his aunt domitia had her freedman paris taken from her , avowedly by civil law , much to the emperor's disgrace , by whose direction a decision that he was freeborn was obtained
 seldom have the affections of the army attached themselves to any man who sought to gain them by his virtues as firmly as they did to him from the indolence of his character
 on this curtius montanus met him with a fierce speech , in which he went to the length of asserting , that after the death of galba , money had been given by regulus to the murderer of piso , and that he had even fastened his teeth in the murdered man's head
 envoys who came to him from tiridates and vologeses about peace , he did not repulse , but sent back with them some centurions with a message anything but harsh
a change of affairs ensued on the arrival of caesar , the hostages were returned to the aedui , their old dependencies restored , and new acquired through caesar , their other interests , their influence , their reputation were likewise increased , and in consequence , the sequani lost the sovereignty .
 for it was falsely rumored that caesar was approaching , and that his cavalry were already at the gates . 
 a hearing was given to embassies from the municipal towns and colonies , and the people of florentia begged that the clanis might not be turned out of its channel and made to flow into the arnus , as that would bring ruin on themselves
 when they were confident that they could protect the works which lay around from this turret , they resolved to build a musculus , sixty feet long , of timber , two feet square , and to extend it from the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall . 
 agrippina was thoroughly dismayed fearing the worst , and defying the immediate obloquy of the deed , she availed herself of the complicity of xenophon , the physician , which she had already secured
 all was at once hurry there were conferences among those on the spot and despatches to the generals and armies
the soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions , as they had been stationed on the left part of the army , casting their weapons , speedily drove the atrebates who were breathless with running and fatigue , and worn out with wounds , from the higher ground into the river ; and following them as they were endeavoring to pass it , slew with their swords a great part of them while impeded .
caesar , having perceived the camp of the enemy deserted , covers the military insignia of his men , conceals the standards , and transfers his soldiers in small bodies from the greater to the less camp , and points out to the lieutenants whom he had placed in command over the respective legions , what he should wish to be done ; he particularly advises them to restrain their men from advancing too far , through their desire of fighting , or their hope of plunder , he sets before them what disadvantages the unfavorable nature of the ground carries with it ; that they could be assisted by dispatch alone : that success depended on a surprise , and not on a battle .
 the chauci , on promising aid , were associated with us in military fellowship
 as he thought over future possibilities , he could devise no plan but to keep the enemy within the woods , till the wounded and the more encumbered troops were in advance
 and what is most unusual , and only given to systematic discipline , they rely more on the general than on the army
 it was evident that they were seeking to begin massacre and plunder , and the proscription of all the most virtuous citizens , and otho had not yet sufficient authority to prevent crime , though he could command it
 he also thought that there was a shorter road to the acquisition of wealth through offices connected with the administration of the emperor's private business
 though sterner judges pronounced vitellius to be a man of low tastes , those who were partial to him attributed to geniality and good nature the immoderate and indiscriminate prodigality , with which he gave away what was his own , and squandered what did not belong to him
 let us honour thee not so much with transitory praises as with our reverence , and , if our powers permit us , with our emulation
they had furnished , more over , the whole wall on every side with turrets , and had covered them with skins .
 while he was thus speaking , the host shouted applause every warrior bound himself by his national oath not to shrink from weapons or wounds
 this struck terror into the enemy and gave confidence to our men , and they separated without advantage to either
 at last , convinced that she would be too formidable , wherever she might dwell , he resolved to destroy her , merely deliberating whether it was to be accomplished by poison , or by the sword , or by any other violent means
 and when he found fault with the temperature of the water , an answer was heard , that it would soon be warm enough
 civilis thus opened the conference if it were before a legate of vitellius that i were defending myself , my acts would deserve no pardon , my words no credit
 there were brave kinsmen and faithful sons in law there were slaves whose fidelity defied even torture
 it was then resolved to delay no longer memmius pollio , the consul-elect , was induced by great promises to deliver a speech , praying claudius to betroth octavia to domitius the match was not unsuitable to the age of either , and was likely to develop still more important results pollio introduced the motion in much the same language as vitellius had lately used
there did not appear to caesar any good reason for holding a conference ; and the more so as the day before the germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men .
 the commotions in the east , he said , could be quieted only by the wisdom , of germanicus
 the soldiers gloated over the bloodshed as though it gave them absolution
 among the sarmatae the general's voice was not alone to be heard
 their dislike , however , was concealed
it was an affair of great danger to fight with such large forces in a disadvantageous situation .
 the rhine springs from a precipitous and inaccessible height of the rhætian alps , bends slightly westward , and mingles with the northern ocean
petrosidius , the standard bearer , when he was overpowered by the great number of the enemy , threw the eagle within the intrenchments and is himself slain while fighting with the greatest courage before the camp .
 at this very moment our legions at the old camp are suffering the horrors of famine and of siege , and cannot be shaken by threats or by promises
 the freedman , however , declared the deed was his , that he had , in fact , avenged his patron's wrongs
 seneca , it was said , to avert from himself the obloquy of sacrilege , begged for the seclusion of a remote rural retreat , and , when it was refused , feigning ill health , as though he had a nervous ailment , would not quit his chamber
nor did he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a cavalry action , the archers being intermixed , what spirit and valor there was in each of his own men .
 there is now a change of fortune , and even he who chose sejanus to be his colleague and his son-in-law excuses his error as for the rest , the man whom they encouraged by shameful baseness , they now wickedly revile
 we were helped , as often before , by the good fortune of the roman people , which brought to the spot mucianus with the armies of the east , and by the decisive settlement which in the meantime was effected at cremona
 with a fleet thus appointed , encouraged by the entreaties and tears of all the old men , matrons , and virgins to succor the state in this hour of distress , they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had fought before . 
 inquiring the cause , he was told that caecina tuscus was entertaining a large party , of whom junius blaesus was the most distinguished
 he closed the lustrum , the census for which gave a total of 5 , 984 , 072 citizens
 throughout the night the battle raged in many forms , indecisive and fierce , destructive , first to one side , then to the other
 that old passion for power which has been ever innate in man increased and broke out as the empire grew in greatness
 there he destroyed a cohort , once a part of the royal contingent
he must feel suspicious , that caesar , though feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in gaul , was keeping it with the view of crushing him .
 those of the britons who , having as yet taken no part in the engagement , occupied the hill-tops , and who without fear for themselves sat idly disdaining the smallness of our numbers , had begun gradually to descend and to hem in the rear of the victorious army , when agricola , who feared this very movement , opposed their advance with four squadrons of cavalry held in reserve by him for any sudden emergencies of battle
 a temple also erected to the divine claudius was ever before their eyes , a citadel , as it seemed , of perpetual tyranny men chosen as priests had to squander their whole fortunes under the pretence of a religious ceremonial
 they satisfy their hunger without elaborate preparation and without delicacies
he impresses on them that the war must be prosecuted on a very different system from that which had been previously adopted ; but they should by all means aim at this object , that the romans should be prevented from foraging and procuring provisions ; that this was easy , because they themselves were well supplied with cavalry , and were likewise assisted by the season of the year ; that forage could not be cut ; that the enemy must necessarily disperse , and look for it in the houses , that all these might be daily destroyed by the horse .
caesar , complaining , that after they had sued for peace , and had voluntarily sent embassadors into the continent for that purpose , they had made war without a reason , said that he would pardon their indiscretion , and imposed hostages , a part of whom they gave immediately ; the rest they said they would give in a few days , since they were sent for from remote places .
 no troops could shew so little spirit when fighting on foot
 about the same time julia died , the granddaughter of augustus he had condemned her on a conviction of adultery and had banished her to the island of trimerus , not far from the shores of apulia
 vitellius , on the contrary , was sunk in sloth , and anticipated the enjoyment of supreme power in indolent luxury and prodigal festivities by midday he was half-intoxicated , and heavy with food yet the ardour and vigour of the soldiers themselves discharged all the duties of a general as well as if the emperor had been present to stimulate the energetic by hope and the indolent by fear
 the batavians had exposed the left wing by their desertion , and they immediately turned against our men
 still the emperor did not change the policy which he had once for all adopted on the death of pandus , whom rhescuporis accused of being his personal enemy , he appointed to the government of moesia pomponius flaccus , a veteran soldier , specially because of his close intimacy with the king and his consequent ability to entrap him
 fonteius capito he murdered , either after he had corrupted him , or because he had failed to do so
 messala valerius further proposed that the oath of allegiance to tiberius should be yearly renewed , and when tiberius asked him whether it was at his bidding that he had brought forward this motion , he replied that he had proposed it spontaneously , and that in whatever concerned the state he would use only his own discretion , even at the risk of offending
 but in each case their religious worship was that of diana or apollo
 for pompey , after the first day's delay , and the fatigue which he endured for some days in vain , though he exerted himself by forced marches , and was anxious to overtake us , who had got the start of him , on the fourth day desisted from the pursuit , and determined to follow other measures . 
 it was a scene neither of agitation nor of repose , but there reigned the silence of profound alarm and profound indignation
 those of otho were betrayed by their strange faces in a place where all knew each other
 what ensued was a massacre rather than a battle
 the first was supported by all the strength of gaul
 that same year the profligacy of women was checked by stringent enactments , and it was provided that no woman whose grandfather , father , or husband had been a roman knight should get money by prostitution
 if not , why , when leaving the rostra , had he gone to the house of his brother , looking as it did over the forum , and certain to provoke the gaze of the multitude , rather than to the aventine , and the family house of his wife
 tiberius submitted to this at the time not ungraciously , but the remembrance of it was vividly impressed on a mind which brooded over its resentments , even though the first impulse of his displeasure had subsided
 lucius vitellius , infamous as he was , had yet some energy , but it was not through his virtues , as is the case with the good , but through his vices , that he , like the worst of villains , was formidable
 the tribune vipstanus messalla followed with the auxiliary troops from moesia , whom , though hurriedly brought up , long service had made as good soldiers as the legionaries
caesar , on this matter being reported to him , ceasing from his expedition and deferring all other affairs , sends a great part of the cavalry to pursue him , and commands that he be brought back ; he orders that if he use violence and do not submit , that he be slain ; considering that dumnorix would do nothing as a rational man while he himself was absent , since he had disregarded his command even when present .
the gauls , having broken down the bridges , posted themselves on this hill , in confidence of their position , and being drawn up in tribes according to their respective states , held all the fords and passages of that marsh with trusty guards , thus determined that if the romans should attempt to force the marsh , they would overpower them from the higher ground while sticking in it , so that whoever saw the nearness of the position , would imagine that the two armies were prepared to fight on almost equal terms ; but whoever should view accurately the disadvantage of position , would discover that they were showing off an empty affectation of courage .
 for there was division and discord in the court , with unexpressed partialities towards either drusus or germanicus
 piso was at the island of coos when tidings reached him that germanicus was dead
they rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold , and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited , namely , the sun , fire , and the moon ; they have not heard of the other deities even by report .
 as he was going , turullius cerialis with a great number of the levies from the fleet , and julius briganticus with a few troopers , gave themselves up to him julius commanded a squadron of horse he was a batavian turullius was a centurion of the first rank , not unfriendly to caecina , as he had commanded a company in germany
 tiberius's language even in matters which he did not care to conceal , either from nature or habit , was always hesitating and obscure , and now that he was struggling to hide his feelings completely , it was all the more involved in uncertainty and doubt
caesar , having disembarked his army and chosen a convenient place for the camp , when he discovered from the prisoners in what part the forces of the enemy had lodged themselves , having left ten cohorts and 300 horse at the sea , to be a guard to the ships , hastens to the enemy , at the third watch , fearing the less for the ships , for this reason because he was leaving them fastened at anchor upon an even and open shore ; and he placed quintus atrius over the guard of the ships .
 we have the germans our kinsmen
 that these parts principally were left unguarded by the enemy's fleet , because they dare not venture too far from the harbor . 
there he learns from some prisoners what things are going on in the camp of cicero , and in how great jeopardy the affair is .
 after this piso was seldom seen at caesar's tribunal , and if he ever sat by him , it was with a sullen frown and a marked display of opposition
 when he was set before the emperor's tribunal , he spoke as follows had my moderation in prosperity been equal to my noble birth and fortune , i should have entered this city as your friend rather than as your captive and you would not have disdained to receive , under a treaty of peace , a king descended from illustrious ancestors and ruling many nations
caesar orders the horse to be drawn out of the camp , and commences a cavalry action his men being now distressed , caesar sends to their aid about four hundred german horse , which he had determined , at the beginning , to keep with himself .
 every other route was closed , and the only one open was one which led into the via sacra
 it was noted by learned men , that no previous example of adoption into the patrician family of the claudii was to be found and that from attus clausus there had been one unbroken line
 seated himself on an elephant , he crossed the river arsanias , while those next to his person rushed through it at the utmost speed of their horses
 magnesia , under mount sipylus , was considered to come next in loss and in need of help
 it would be better to draw them into friendly union
 when caesar attempted to gain any place , though pompey had resolved not to oppose him with his whole force , or to come to a general engagement , yet he detached to particular places slingers and archers , with which his army abounded , and several of our men were wounded , and filled with great dread of the arrows ; and almost all the soldiers made coats or coverings for themselves of hair cloths , tarpaulins , or raw hides to defend them against the weapons . 
caesar , after delaying several days at avaricum , and , finding there the greatest plenty of corn and other provisions , refreshed his army after their fatigue and privation .
 silana indeed had died a natural death at tarentum , whither she had returned from her distant exile , when the power of agrippina , to whose enmity she owed her fall , began to totter , or her wrath was at last appeased
 even the italian and then the civil war did not pass without the enactment of many conflicting laws , till lucius sulla , the dictator , by the repeal or alteration of past legislation and by many additions , gave us a brief lull in this process , to be instantly followed by the seditious proposals of lepidus , and soon afterwards by the tribunes recovering their license to excite the people just as they chose
 often have i heard our emperor complain when any one has anticipated his mercy by a self-inflicted death
 persons well acquainted with the emperor's feelings came to ask agricola , as if on their own account , whether he would go
 to the death of poppaea , which , though a public grief , was a delight to those who recalling the past thought of her shamelessness and cruelty , nero added fresh and greater odium by forbidding caius cassius to attend the funeral
 it was usual , he argued , for magistrates to bring a private citizen to trial , and a consul's authority ought not to be impaired , seeing that it rested with his vigilance to guard the commonwealth from loss
the embassadors said that they would report these things to their country men ; and , after having deliberated on the matter , would return to caesar after the third day , they begged that he would not in the mean time advance his camp nearer to them .
of these the bellovaci did not contribute their number , as they said that they would wage war against the romans on their own account , and at their own discretion , and would not obey the order of any one : however , at the request of commius , they sent two thousand , in consideration of a tie of hospitality which subsisted between him and them .
 it was put with the body , which had by that time been reduced to ashes such was the end of servius galba , who in his seventy-three years had lived prosperously through the reigns of five emperors , and had been more fortunate under the rule of others than he was in his own
 trusting to the protection of the temple , hindered too by secret accomplices in the revolt , who embarrassed their plans , they had constructed neither fosse nor rampart nor had they removed their old men and women , leaving their youth alone to face the foe
 why had he come , neither to increase the soldiers' pay , nor to alleviate their hardships , in a word , with no power to better their lot
 the legions , increased in number by the arrival of the men from the fifth and fifteenth , demanded a donative , for they had discovered that some money had been sent by vitellius
 in the fleet there was the same treachery
 neither age nor sex was exempt from peril
 the very sight of the padus excited the men from batavia and the transrhenane provinces crossing the stream by a sudden movement , they advanced on placentia , and seizing some reconnoiterers so terrified the rest , that , deceived by their alarm , they announced that the whole army of caecina was at hand
 nor did the people complain of having the right taken from them , except in mere idle talk , and the senate , being now released from the necessity of bribery and of degrading solicitations , gladly upheld the change , tiberius confining himself to the recommendation of only four candidates who were to be nominated without rejection or canvass
he , on his return , being well aware of the casualties of war , complained of one thing , namely , that the cohorts had been sent away from the outposts and garrison , and pointed out that room ought not to have been left for even the most trivial casualty ; that fortune had exercised great influence in the sudden arrival of their enemy ; much greater , in that she had turned the barbarians away from the very rampart and gates of the camp .
 thus they met in great alarm and distracted by a twofold apprehension no one was ready with any advice of his own , but looked for safety in sharing any mistake with many others
 when he reached the barrier , as long as it was a fight with missiles , the wounds and the slaughter fell chiefly on our soldiers
 assuredly , military service itself is burdensome and unprofitable
 about the same time the emperor spoke on the subject of electing a priest of jupiter in the room of servius maluginensis , deceased , and of the enactment of a new law
 one of the petty kings of the nation , driven out by internal faction , had been received by agricola , who detained him under the semblance of friendship till he could make use of him
 the fact was that the wheat-ships were detained by the severity of the weather , and the lower orders , who were accustomed to buy their provisions from day to day , and to whom cheap corn was the sole subject of public interest , feared and believed that the ports had been closed and the supplies stopped , the vitellianists , who had not yet given up their party feelings , helping to spread the report , which was not displeasing even to the conquerors their ambition , which even foreign campaigns could not fill to the full , was not satisfied by any triumphs that civil war could furnish
 we actually adored a satrius and a pomponius
 to imbue the army with a spirit of licence , he offered to the legions the commissions of the centurions killed in the war
 it was in the emperor's chamber , in the presence of messalina , that he was heard there suilius accused him of corrupting the troops , of binding them by bribes and indulgences to share in every crime , of adultery with poppaea , and finally of unmanly vice
 he might go without a fear , they said , and experience in his person men's veneration for him
 hence rumour persistently affirmed that he had ventured to send the emperor a letter , reminding him that his alliance with sejanus had not originated in his own choice , but in the advice of tiberius
 we are deliberating
 not only is the sex feeble and unequal to hardship , but , when it has liberty , it is spiteful , intriguing and greedy of power
embassadors are sent to caesar on this subject .
 tiberius , in reply , after praising the loyal sentiments of sejanus and briefly enumerating the favours he had bestowed on him , asked time for impartial consideration , adding that while other men's plans depended on their ideas of their own interest , princes , who had to regulate their chief actions by public opinion , were in a different position
 soon afterwards germanicus led back his army to the amisia , taking his legions by the fleet , as he had brought them up
 thus , by the perfidy of the enemy and the violence of the storm , the labor of many months was destroyed in a moment . 
 vespasian's early policy , and the government of rome were directed by mucianus , for domitian was a mere youth , and from his father's elevation sought only the opportunities of indulgence
when caesar was not more than twelve miles distant from the enemy , the ambassadors return to him , as had been arranged ; who meeting him on the march , earnestly entreated him not to advance any further .
 but cassius , as far as it was possible without war , revived ancient discipline , kept exercising the legions , in short , used as much diligence and precaution as if an enemy were threatening him
 early in the summer agricola sustained a domestic affliction in the loss of a son born a year before , a calamity which he endured , neither with the ostentatious fortitude displayed by many brave men , nor , on the other hand , with womanish tears and grief
 before me , three legions , three commanders have fallen
 it was by robbery , plunder , or the most servile occupations that the soldiers' holiday was purchased
 then he broke his signet-ring , that it might not be subsequently available for imperilling others
these he distributed among the horse ; the rest of the army , he delivered to quintus titurius sabinus and lucius aurunculeius cotta , his legates , to lead into the territories of the menapii and those cantons of the morini from which embassadors had not come to him .
 as for tiberius , he went to the senate house during the whole time of the prince's illness , either because he was not afraid , or to show his strength of mind , and even in the interval between his death and funeral
our men were equal to them in fighting , both in courage and in number , and though they were deserted by their leader and by fortune , yet they still placed all hope of safety in their valor , and as often as any cohort sallied forth on that side , a great number of the enemy usually fell .
 his wife followed him with his little children , and filled every place with her wailings
 and so the latin letters have the same form as the oldest greek characters
thither ariovistus sent light troops , about 16 , 000 men in number , with all his cavalry ; which forces were to intimidate our men , and hinder them in their fortification .
 if they are satisfied , they brandish their spears
 induced by their opinion , varus the next day led his troops out of the camp : curio did so in like manner , and with only one small valley between them , each drew up his forces . 
having cast a very large quantity of their arms from the wall into the trench that was before the town , so that the heaps of arms almost equalled the top of the wall and the rampart , and nevertheless having retained and concealed , as we afterward discovered , about a third part in the town , the gates were opened , and they enjoyed peace for that day .
 and they counted at the same time on the treachery that might follow on scarcity , on the wavering fidelity of the slaves , and on the chances of war
 there were no resolutions of the people or anything to be found in the books of ceremonies on the subject
 tradition says that tiberius as often as he left the senate-house used to exclaim in greek , how ready these men are to be slaves clearly , even he , with his dislike of public freedom , was disgusted at the abject abasement of his creatures
 at rome meanwhile , besides the shocks already sustained by the imperial house , came the first step towards the destruction of agrippina , claudia pulchra , her cousin , being prosecuted by domitius afer
 even parents themselves familiarise their little ones , not with virtue and modesty , but with jesting and glib talk , which lead on by degrees to shamelessness and to contempt for themselves as well as for others
 their antiquity is strongly attested by their religion
 the centre was the post assigned to the ubii and lingones
 both were appealed to by different arguments on the one side they extolled the strength of the legions and of the army of germany
 it was , they argued , sufficient reward for the childless to have influence and distinction , everything , in short , easy and open to them , without a care and without a burden
 there were continual skirmishes , surprises , and incendiary fires , and a vast quantity of corn was burnt
 here there were vast materials for a revolution , without indeed a decided bias towards any one man , but ready to a daring hand
 by their retreat the archers and slingers , being left destitute and defenseless , were all cut to pieces . 
 how much better by slaying the traitor , to set free our valour and our fortune from these evil auspices ! the passions already kindled by the language which they thus held among themselves were yet more inflamed by a despatch from vespasian , which flaccus , finding that it could not be concealed , read before an assembly of the troops , sending the persons who had brought it in chains to vitellius
 it seemed beneath them to await the result of famine the army demanded the more perilous alternative , some prompted by courage , many by sheer ferocity and greed of gain
 both had perished without hearing or defence , like innocent men his entry into the capital , made after the slaughter of thousands of unarmed soldiers , was most ill-omened , and was terrible even to the executioners
 the cavalry having attacked them , when sunk in sleep and dispersed , killed a great number of them ; many were frightened and ran away . 
 their adulation was open enough in most flattering language they voted a triumph to mucianus , a triumph for a civil war , though the expedition against the sarmatae was the pretext
 to counteract this , pompey fitted out large merchant ships , which he found in the harbor of brundusium : on them he erected turrets three stories high , and , having furnished them with several engines and all sorts of weapons , drove them among caesar's works , to break through the floats and interrupt the works ; thus there happened skirmishes every day at a distance with slings , arrows , and other weapons . 
 they were at once panic-stricken by the attack of petilius cerialis on the state of the brigantes , said to be the most prosperous in the entire province
 such , he said , was the emperor's bidding
 but i shall come to them separately after a while
 this surrender was accepted julius alpinus , one of the principal men , was executed by caecina , as having been the promoter of the war
 to explore the prince's secret thoughts , or any of his hidden plans , is a forbidden , a dangerous thing , nor does it follow that one could reach them
 he then led back the army and received on the proposal of tiberius the title of imperator
 the same day he made a great part of his horse pass the river , who , falling on the foragers by surprise as they were dispersed without any suspicions , intercepted an incredible number of cattle and people ; and when some spanish light-armed cohorts were sent to reinforce the enemy , our men judiciously divided themselves into two parts , the one to protect the spoil , the other to resist the advancing foe , and to beat them back , and they cut off from the rest and surrounded one cohort , which had rashly ventured out of the line before the others , and after putting it to the sword , returned safe with considerable booty to the camp over the same bridge . 
 if i have sinned through irresolution , my valour shall make amends for it
 but the minds of attius's soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the flight and slaughter of their men , never thought of opposing us ; and they all imagined that they were already surrounded by our horse , and , therefore , before a dart could be thrown , or our men come near them , varus's whole army turned their backs and retreated to their camp . 
for they determine respecting almost all controversies , public and private ; and if any crime has been perpetrated , if murder has been committed , if there be any dispute about an inheritance , if any about boundaries , these same persons decide it ; they decree rewards and punishments ; if any one , either in a private or public capacity , has not submitted to their decision , they interdict him from the sacrifices .
 the walls were strengthened , battlements were added , and the towers were raised in height it was not only of the implements of war that provision and preparation were made , but of the spirit of subordination and the love of obedience
 encouraged by the omen and finding the auspices favourable , he called an assembly , and explained the precautions which wisdom suggested as suitable for the impending battle
 but labienus , having obtained his consent that the prisoners should be delivered up to him , had them all brought out , as it appeared , to make a show of them , and that pompey might place a greater confidence in him who was a deserter ; and calling them fellow soldiers , and asking them in the most insulting manner whether it was usual with veterans to flee , ordered them to be put to death in the sight of the whole army . 
 it was evident , however , that there was some treacherous design beneath this advice , that the cohorts would be dispersed only to be more easily crushed , and that the guiding hand in the war was not brinno but civilis for indications of the truth , which the germans , a people who delight in war , could not long conceal , were gradually coming to light
 the poems which we read of bibaculus and catullus are crammed with invectives on the caesars
caesar , having received as hostages the first men of the state , and even the two sons of king galba himself ; and all the arms in the town having been delivered up , admitted the suessiones to a surrender , and led his army against the bellovaci .
 the territory of the treveri was occupied by the victorious army , when civilis and classicus sent letters to cerialis , the purport of which was as follows 
in this caesar avenged not only the public but also his own personal wrongs , because the tigurini had slain lucius piso the legate , the grandfather of lucius calpurnius piso , his father-in-law , in the same battle as cassius himself .
 marius celsus acquiesced in the opinion of paullinus
 fictitious speeches too against sejanus were published under the names of ex-consuls , for several persons indulged , all the more recklessly because anonymously , the caprice of their imaginations
 drusus is now lost to us , and i turn my prayers to you , and before heaven and your country i adjure you to receive into your care and guidance the great-grandsons of augustus , descendants of a most noble ancestry
when it was reported to caesar that they were attempting to make their route through our province he hastens to set out from the city , and , by as great marches as he can , proceeds to further gaul , and arrives at geneva .
 spurinna , who now held placentia , was sure that caecina had not yet arrived , and that , even were he approaching , he ought to keep his men within their fortifications , and not confront a veteran army with three praetorian cohorts , a thousand veterans , and a handful of cavalry but the undisciplined and inexperienced soldiery seized their standards and colours , and rushed to the attack , brandishing their weapons in the face of their general when he sought to restrain them , and spurning from them the tribunes and centurions , and even crying out that otho was betrayed and that caecina had come by invitation
 why , the freedmen usually have as much
 at daybreak drusus called them to an assembly , and , though not a practised speaker , yet with natural dignity upbraided them for their past and commended their present behaviour
 pharasmanes , to his face , replied vaguely and often in a conciliatory tone , while by secret messages he recommended rhadamistus to hurry on the siege by all possible means
 he was to avoid the obvious refuge of a coward's death , and in the pity felt for a noble name he would soon find good men to help him , and daring spirits would rally round him
 he had disgraced himself in his first campaign when he served under the legate calvisius sabinus
 archelaus , either quite unsuspicious of treachery , or dreading compulsion , should it be thought that he saw through it , hastened to rome
 in an island of the ocean there is a sacred grove , and within it a consecrated chariot , covered over with a garment
 vitellius was distributing to each soldier provisions ready dressed on the same abundant scale as the gladiators' rations , and the populace had poured forth , and spread themselves throughout the entire camp
the vineae having been quickly brought up against the town , a mound thrown up , and towers built , the gauls , amazed by the greatness of the works , such as they had neither seen nor heard of before , and struck also by the dispatch of the romans , send embassadors to caesar respecting a surrender , and succeed in consequence of the remi requesting that they might be spared .
 the emperor then read out the charges and the accusers' names , with such calmness as not to seem to soften or aggravate the accusations
 quintus haterius too and mamercus scaurus ruffled his suspicious temper , haterius by having said , how long , caesar , will you suffer the state to be without a head
 i invite you , vespasian , to a dignity which will be as beneficial to the state , as it will be honourable to yourself
 we senators have hitherto been too lenient in allowing him to be mocked with impunity by thrasea throwing off allegiance , by his son-in-law helvidius priscus indulging similar frenzies , by paconius agrippinus , the inheritor of his father's hatred towards emperors , and by curtius montanus , the habitual composer of abominable verses
another side lies toward spain and the west , on which part is ireland , less , as is reckoned , than britain , by one half : but the passage into britain is of equal distance with that from gaul .
but if you know not these things which are going on in distant countries , look to the neighboring gaul , which being reduced to the form of a province , stripped of its rights and laws , and subjected to roman despotism , is oppressed by perpetual slavery .
 the subtleties of logic , the useful lessons of ethical science , the movements and causes of the universe , were alike known to him
 the crowd was made more unwieldy by senators and knights who came to meet him from the capital , some moved by fear , many by a spirit of adulation , others , and by degrees all , that they might not be left behind while the rest were going
 the emperor , with agrippina seated near him , presided
 to the fleet he had added some city cohorts , and many of the praetorians , the stay and strength of his army , who might at once advise and watch the generals
 as soon as antonius could recognize his men and be recognized by them , he sought to kindle their courage , striving to shame some with his reproaches , stirring many with praise and encouragement , and all with hopes and promises
 i will deal more frankly
while these things are going forward in those places , cassivellaunus sends messengers into kent , which , we have observed above , is on the sea , over which several districts four kings reigned , cingetorix , carvilius , taximagulus and segovax , and commands them to collect all their forces , and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval camp .
having drawn out all his forces at the break of day , and marshaled them in a double line , he posted the auxiliaries in the center , and waited to see what measures the enemy would take .
 this same people prosecuted acilius strabo who had held the office of praetor , and had been sent by claudius to adjudicate on some lands which were bequeathed by king apion , their former possessor , together with his kingdom to the roman people , and which had since been seized by the neighbouring proprietors , who trusted to a long continued licence in wrong , as if it constituted right and justice
 the centre of their line had been penetrated , and the othonianists fled on all sides in the direction of bedriacum
 libo meanwhile , in mourning apparel and accompanied by ladies of the highest rank , went to house after house , entreating his relatives , and imploring some eloquent voice to ward off his perils which all refused , on different pretexts , but from the same apprehension
 intelligence of this being brought to rome , so great a panic spread on a sudden that when lentulus , the consul , came to open the treasury , to deliver money to pompey by the senate's decree , immediately on opening the hallowed door he fled from the city . 
 not long afterwards , granius marcellus , proconsul of bithynia , was accused of treason by his quaestor , caepio crispinus , and the charge was supported by romanus hispo
in the mean while the report respecting the victory of caesar is conveyed to labienus through the country of the remi with incredible speed , so that , though he was about sixty miles distant from the winter-quarter of cicero , and caesar had arrived there after the ninth hour , before midnight a shout arose at the gates of the camp , by which shout an indication of the victory and a congratulation on the part of the remi were given to labienus .
 but afterward , when he found that caesar was detained before massilia , that the forces of petreius had effected a junction with the army of afranius , that considerable reinforcements had come to their assistance , that there were great hopes and expectations , and heard that the whole hither province had entered into a confederacy , and of the difficulties to which caesar was reduced afterward at ilerda for want of provisions , and afranius wrote to him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these matters , he began to regulate his movements by those of fortune . 
 additional height was given to the structure
 upon this caius cassius , governor of syria , was commissioned to escort the young prince to the bank of the euphrates
 with scrupulous piety and modesty she regulated not only the boy's studies and occupations , but even his recreations and games
 on the delivery of this speech , no intimation of their future conduct is given by curio's army , and thus both generals led back their troops to their camp . 
 germanicus , however , entered on the office at nicopolis , a city of achaia , whither he had arrived by the coast of illyricum , after having seen his brother drusus , who was then in dalmatia , and endured a stormy voyage through the adriatic and afterwards the ionian sea
 while piso's hopes were in suspense , she offered to share his lot , whatever it might be , and in the worst event , to be his companion in death
 the centurion had actually added , as something highly meritorious , his own language in all its brutality , and some utterances of the dying man in which , at first feigning loss of reason , he imprecated in seeming madness fearful things on tiberius , and then , when hope of life was gone , denounced him with a studied and elaborate curse as he had slain a daughter-in-law , a brother's son , and son's sons , and filled his whole house with bloodshed , so might he pay the full penalty due to the name and race of his ancestors as well as to future generations
 sword in hand , throughout the capital , the conquerors hunted down the conquered with merciless hatred
 all this having been completed , nero assembled the troops and distributed two thousand sesterces to every common soldier , with an addition of as much corn without payment , as they had previously the use of at the market price
 fabius sounded the inclinations of the neighboring states by letters and messengers . 
eporedirix and viridomarus , the principal men of the state , being accused of treason , have been slain by the romans without any permission to plead their cause .
in the mean time , commius and the rest of the leaders , to whom the supreme command had been intrusted , came with all their forces to alesia , and having occupied the entire hill , encamped not more than a mile from our fortifications .
 they themselves lie buried in sloth , a strange combination in their nature that the same men should be so fond of idleness , so averse to peace
 being found and put to the torture that he might be forced to reveal his accomplices , he exclaimed in a loud voice , in the language of his country , that it was in vain to question him
 the truth was that agrippina , having contrived the murder of his brother lucius silanus , dreaded his vengeance for it was the incessant popular talk that preference ought to be given over nero , who was scarcely out of his boyhood and had gained the empire by crime , to a man of mature age , of blameless life , of noble birth , and , as a point then much regarded , of the line of the caesars
divico replied , that the helvetii had been so trained by their ancestors , that they were accustomed to receive , not to give hostages ; of that fact the roman people were witness .
they themselves rushed out of the woods to fight here and there , and prevented our men from entering their fortifications .
 nothing ever happened to cotta more to his distinction of noble birth , but beggared by extravagance and infamous for his excesses , he was now by dignity of his revenge , raised to a level with the stainless virtues of arruntius
 afranius and petreius , and their friends , sent fuller and more circumstantial accounts of these things to rome , to their acquaintances . 
 but not being able to prevail with them , he set at liberty some slaves from the work-houses , and began to assault cosa in the district of thurinum . 
 then let not a batavian refugee affect to decide the destinies of rome let him rather await the merited penalty of his guilt
 there occurred another terrible presage a bull escaped from the altar , scattered the preparations for sacrifice , and was finally slain far from the spot where the victims are usually struck down
 in every household the children , naked and filthy , grow up with those stout frames and limbs which we so much admire
 in nominating , excusing , and changing the deputies , the senate having entrusted the selection to galba , the emperor shewed a disgraceful want of firmness , yielding to individuals , who made interest to stay or to go , as their fears or their hopes prompted
 cornelius martialis , flavius nepos , statius domitius were then deprived of the tribuneship , on the ground , not of actually hating the emperor , but of having the credit of it
word was brought back , that it was easy .
 he spurned all delay , as having been nero's fatal mistake
 in a few days' time he might have said the very same words in his place as a senator
 caesar , hoping to surprise this legion , and anxious to repair the loss sustained that day , left two cohorts employed in the works to make an appearance of intrenching himself , and by a different route , as privately as he could , with his other cohorts amounting to thirty-three , among which was the ninth legion , which had lost so many centurions , and whose privates were greatly reduced in number , he marched in two lines against pompey's legion and his lesser camp . 
 and he refrained not from taunts noble the father , he would say , mighty the general , brave the army which , with such strength , has carried off one weak woman
 all other nations were equally restless
caesar , since he had determined to pass the winter on the continent , on account of the sudden revolts of gaul , and as much of the summer did not remain , and he perceived that even that could be easily protracted , demands hostages , and prescribes what tribute britain should pay each year to the roman people ; he forbids and commands cassivellaunus that he not wage war against mandubracius or the trinobantes .
 he was indeed a man formed both by nature and by education to attract even such a character as that of mucianus the tribunes , the centurions , and the common soldiers , were brought over to the cause by appeals to their energy or their love of license , to their virtues or to their vices , according to their different dispositions
sabinus having encouraged his men , gives them the signal , which they earnestly desired .
 after a while , dispersing in search of water and provisions , they encountered many of the britons , who sought to defend their property often victorious , though now and then beaten , they were at last reduced to such an extremity of want as to be compelled to eat , at first , the feeblest of their number , and then victims selected by lot
 agrippa , her grandfather , had , as it happened , received this tribe , when they crossed the rhine , under our protection
 neither tribune nor camp-prefect maintained authority any longer
 at the same time he gave them notice to be ready for battle on the day following , and since the opportunity which they had so often wished for was now arrived , not to disappoint the opinion generally entertained of their experience and valor . 
 there can be no more effectual instrument of good government than good friends
do you doubt their fidelity and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day ? what then ? do you suppose that the romans are employed every day in the outer fortifications for mere amusement ? if you can not be assured by their dispatches , since every avenue is blocked up , take the romans as evidence that their approach is drawing near ; since they , intimidated by alarm at this , labor night and day at their works .
 campania was devastated by a hurricane , which destroyed everywhere countryhouses , plantations and crops , and carried its fury to the neighbourhood of rome , where a terrible plague was sweeping away all classes of human beings without any such derangement of the atmosphere as to be visibly apparent
therefore , having fortified the camp , he began to bring up the vineae , and to provide whatever things were necessary for the storm .
 there was a confused hum , a fierce shouting , and a sudden lull
 this was indeed the occasion of the crime agricola , who instantly set out to discharge the duties of affection , was overtaken by the tidings that vespasian was aiming at the throne he at once joined his party
 on his approach , five cohorts , sent by domitius from the town , were breaking down a bridge which was over the river , at three miles' distance from it . 
 the powerful influence of the 6th had made galba emperor the men of the 2nd were in that battle first to consecrate their new standards and new eagle
 there have ever been the same causes at work to make the germans cross over into gaul , lust , avarice , and the longing for a new home , prompting them to leave their own marshes and deserts , and to possess themselves of this most fertile soil and of you its inhabitants
 the two parties engage , and as afranius's men had reached the eminence first , our men were repulsed , and , on a reinforcement being sent , they were obliged to turn their backs and retreat to the standards of legions . 
 full of confidence in his troops , and despising the small number of caesar's soldiers , achillas seized alexandria , except that part of the town which caesar occupied with his troops . 
 as for marcellus eprius , whom i have just mentioned , and crispus vibius it is pleasanter to me to cite recent and modern examples than those of a distant and forgotten past , i would venture to argue that they are quite as great men in the remotest corners of the world as at capua or vercellae , where they are said to have been born
 some climbed projecting piers
 though they seem much , many far inferior to you in merit have obtained more
 in fine , they did not reflect on the common casualties of war ; how trifling causes , either from groundless suspicions , sudden affright , or religious scruples , have oftentimes been productive of considerable losses ; how often an army has been unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general , or the oversight of a tribune ; but as if they had proved victorious by their valor , and as if no change could ever take place , they published the success of the day throughout the world by reports and letters . 
 mamercus scaurus was then for the second time impeached , a man of distinguished rank and ability as an advocate , but of infamous life
 marcellus declared , it is not my opinion that is assailed the consul elect has made a motion in accordance with old precedents , which directed the use of the ballot in the appointment of envoys , in order that there might be no room for intrigue or private animosities
 these he designed to call off by a certain signal , when all the soldiers were embarked , and left row-galleys for them in a secure place . 
 it was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense for these new settlers in the colony of camulodunum drove people out of their houses , ejected them from their farms , called them captives and slaves , and the lawlessness of the veterans was encouraged by the soldiers , who lived a similar life and hoped for similar licence
 their prayers were not heard , till they swore allegiance to the empire of gaul
 his fame had spread thence , and travelled to the neighbouring islands and provinces , and was actually celebrated in italy all were eager to see the great man , who for so many years had defied our power
 curio rashly believing this information , altered his design , and resolved to hazard a battle . 
 he himself varro made severe harangues against caesar . 
 aphrodisia maintained the worship of venus stratonicea , that of jupiter and of diana of the cross ways
and then , a shout being heard in that quarter , our men , their strength having been recruited , , began to fight more vigorously .
 the cause was ascribed to his mother who , having been repeatedly repulsed in her overtures , had at last by her arts and seductions driven him to an extremity from which he could find no escape but death
 tiberius , it is certain , vented his wrath in the foulest charges he reproached her with unchastity , with having had asinius gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence
 what if during those fifteen years , a large portion of human life , many were cut off by ordinary casualties , and the ablest fell victims to the emperor's rage , if a few of us survive , i may almost say , not only others but our ownselves , survive , though there have been taken from the midst of life those many years which brought the young in dumb silence to old age , and the old almost to the very verge and end of existence ! yet we shall not regret that we have told , though in language unskilful and unadorned , the story of past servitude , and borne our testimony to present happiness
 silanus after this lived at rome without attaining office
 eager for battle , and more ready to despise than to be on his guard against the enemy , he fired the spirit of the troops by his bold language
 the general's authority , the stern laws of discipline , require that in many matters even the centurions and tribunes shall only receive orders
 otho was aware how disturbed was the country , and how conflicting the feelings of the soldiery , the most respectable of whom cried out for some remedy for the existing licence , while the great mass delighted in riot and in an empire resting on popularity , and could be most easily urged to civil war by indulgence in tumult and rapine at the same time he reflected that power acquired by crime could not be retained by a sudden assumption of the moderation and of the dignity of former times , yet he was alarmed by the critical position of the capital and by the perils of the senate
 the most degraded out of other races , scorning their national beliefs , brought to them their contributions and presents this augmented the wealth of the jews , as also did the fact , that among themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever ready to shew compassion , though they regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies
 he too had been exasperated by the publication of verses of uncertain authorship , pointed at his cruelty , his arrogance , and his dissensions with his mother
 next , the very knowledge of many subjects sits gracefully on us , even when we are otherwise engaged , and makes itself visible and conspicuous where you would least expect it
they , greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair , though those things were spoken by an enemy , still thought they were not to be disregarded ; and they were especially influenced by this consideration , that it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the eburones had dared to make war upon the roman people of their own accord .
 caesar's scouts brought him word that the standard of a legion was carried to this place . 
 they received his speech with feelings that varied between hope , fear , and shame
 that he was himself as liable to be deceived as tiberius , and that the same mistake ought not to be held innocent in the prince and be a source of ruin to others
 he had been germanicus's quaestor , while seneca had been a paramour in his house
which battle being finished , inasmuch as galba was unwilling to tempt fortune again , and remembered that he had come into winter quarters with one design , and saw that he had met with a different state of affairs ; chiefly however urged by the want of corn and provision , having the next day burned all the buildings of that village , he hastens to return into the province ; and as no enemy opposed or hindered his march , he brought the legion safe into the nantuates , thence into the allobroges , and there wintered .
 nero's temper however was not one to submit to slaves , and pallas , by a surly arrogance quite beyond a freedman , had provoked disgust
 whenever they are not fighting , they pass much of their time in the chase , and still more in idleness , giving themselves up to sleep and to feasting , the bravest and the most warlike doing nothing , and surrendering the management of the household , of the home , and of the land , to the women , the old men , and all the weakest members of the family
 it is known that haterius having entered the palace to ask pardon , and thrown himself at the knees of tiberius as he was walking , was almost killed by the soldiers , because tiberius fell forward , accidentally or from being entangled by the suppliant's hands
he charges them when departing that each of them should go to his respective state , and press for the war all who were old enough to bear arms ; he states his own merits , and conjures them to consider his safety , and not surrender him who had deserved so well of the general freedom , to the enemy for torture ; he points out to them that , if they should be remiss , eighty thousand chosen men would perish with him ; that upon making a calculation , he had barely corn for thirty days , but could hold out a little longer by economy .
 there was , we are told , no death of which otho heard with greater joy , no head which he surveyed with so insatiable a gaze perhaps it was , that his mind was then for the first time relieved from all anxiety , and so had leisure to rejoice perhaps there was with galba something to recall departed majesty , with vinius some thought of old friendship , which troubled with mournful images even that ruthless heart piso's death , as that of an enemy and a rival , he felt to be a right and lawful subject of rejoicing
 this ended the war dolabella asked for triumphal distinctions , but was refused by tiberius , out of compliment to sejanus , the glory of whose uncle blaesus he did not wish to be forgotten
 when the persons who usually surrounded pacarius had left him , and he was naked and helpless in the bath , they slew him
 these indeed are rough , unpolished , awkward , and ungainly , and i wish that your favourite calvus or caelius or even cicero had in no respect imitated them
 i should not be afraid of comparing it with the harassing and anxious life of the orator orators , it is true , have been raised to consulships by their contests and perils , but i prefer virgil's serene , calm , and peaceful retirement , in which after all he was not without the favour of the di-vine augustus , and fame among the people of rome
 the main body of caesar's army was at hand , and universal ruin threatened them . 
 it was indeed still usual with the senators , when it was their turn to vote , to suggest anything they thought for the state's advantage
 on deliberation it was determined to sound the feeling of the cohort on guard in the palace , but not through galba in person , whose authority was to be kept unimpaired to meet greater emergencies
 claudius however did not seek to veil under any external considerations a concession he had made , with his usual good nature , to an individual
they however , dreading revenge and torture from the gauls , whose lands they had harassed , said that they desired to remain with him .
 but when valens , thus unexpectedly preserved , came forward in sad plight , shedding tears , they were moved to joy , to pity , even to affection
 proceeding at last to abuse and insults , they sought a pretext for beginning a massacre , while a different anxiety also weighed upon the senators , who , knowing that the party of vitellius was in the ascendant , feared that they might seem to have been tardy in welcoming the conqueror
 at the instance of his freedmen for his friends were the less faithful the more distinguished their rank he ordered the tribes to be convoked , and to those who gave in their names administered the oath of service
 there was a debate too about expelling the egyptian and jewish worship , and a resolution of the senate was passed that four thousand of the freedmen class who were infected with those superstitions and were of military age should be transported to the island of sardinia , to quell the brigandage of the place , a cheap sacrifice should they die from the pestilential climate
 with a son-in-law detested , and fathers-in-law also at enmity , what are bonds of love between united hearts became with bitter foes incentives to fury
 accordingly , a rabble of the townsfolk was brought together , with those whom the excitement of such an event had attracted from the neighbouring towns and colonies , and such as followed in the emperor's train to pay him honour or for various objects all these , with some companies of soldiers , filled the theatre at neapolis
 the dacians also were in motion , a people which never can be trusted , and which , now that our legions were withdrawn from moesia , had nothing to fear
 that the war might not burst in all its fury on one point , he sent caecina through the bructeri to the river amisia with forty roman cohorts to distract the enemy , while the cavalry was led by its commander pedo by the territories of the frisii
to the greater part , however , it seemed best , reserving that measure to the last , to await the issue of the matter , and to defend the camp .
to the same place the carnutes send embassadors and hostages , employing as their mediators the remi , under whose protection they were : they receive the same answers .
 i would not deny that my elevation was begun by vespasian , augmented by titus , and still further advanced by domitian
 his wife , paxaea , emulated her husband
 he brought into it the consulship he also held the office of censor for arranging the classes of the knights , and was the first to pile up the wealth which that house enjoyed to a boundless extent
 as the augur lentulus and others argued on various grounds against this view , the result was that they awaited the decision of the supreme pontiff
 this pomponia lived a long life of unbroken melancholy
 whether the young prince spoke or held his tongue , silence and speech were alike criminal
 were their rewards to be at the discretion of absolute rulers , their punishments to be without appeal
 you must consider the plebeian , how he gains distinction from the gown
 the sight of the soldiery restored quiet , and the smaller colonies escaped unpunished
 he dismissed matters of even the greatest importance with brief hearing , and was quite unequal to any serious business
 the contagion spread to the legions and the auxiliary troops , already excited by the news of the wavering loyalty of the army of germany
 he staid only seven days before corfinium , and marched into apulia through the country of the marrucinians , frentanian's and larinates . 
 when they confessed the truth , the whole company clamoured in concert that he must go to the camp , must assure himself of the praetorian cohorts , must think of safety before he thought of vengeance
 the people turned away angrily from their king , were jealous of egypt , and , fearing for themselves , thronged around the temple
the army having been marshaled , rather as the nature of the ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time , than as the method and order of military matters required ; while the legions in the different places were withstanding the enemy , some in one quarter , some in another , and the view was obstructed by the very thick hedges intervening , as we have before remarked , neither could proper reserves be posted , nor could the necessary measures be taken in each part , nor could all the commands be issued by one person .
 besides , he had distributed among his legions a considerable number , by way of recruits , from thessaly , boeotia , achaia , and epirus : with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken from caius antonius . 
but amid difficulties of this nature as far as precautions could be taken by vigilance , such precautions were taken ; so that some opportunities of injuring the enemy were neglected , though the minds of all were burning to take revenge , rather than that injury should be effected with any loss to our soldiers .
he saw that , in consequence of such great difficulties being thrown in his way , he must seek aid from his own energy of disposition .
this report having been carried to the treviri , indutiomarus , who had resolved to attack the camp of labienus the following day , flies by night and leads back all his forces into the country of the treviri .
 day and night , on those rocks and promontories he would incessantly exclaim that he was himself responsible for this awful ruin , and friends scarce restrained him from seeking death in the same sea
 though always at variance , these two men left no authority to vitellius
 all this superstition implies the belief that from this spot the nation took its origin , that here dwells the supreme and all-ruling deity , to whom all else is subject and obedient
having slain these , and seized their ships , they crossed the river before that part of the menapii , who were at peace in their settlements over the rhine , were apprized of ; and seizing all their houses , maintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the winter .
 silius owing to sudden rains did nothing but carry off a small booty , and the wife and daughter of arpus , the chief of the chatti and caesar had no opportunity of fighting given him by the besiegers , who dispersed on the rumour of his advance
 such was the arrangement of the eagles and the standards
 he attempted to storm lissus , but being delayed three days by the vigorous defense of the roman citizens who belonged to that district , and of the soldiers which caesar had sent to keep garrison there , and having lost a few men in the assault , he returned without effecting his object . 
there the daughter and one of the sons of orgetorix was taken .
 the senate was then assembled , and speeches were delivered full of pompous eulogy on the capture of caractacus it was as glorious , they said , as the display of syphax by scipio , or of perses by lucius paulus , or indeed of any captive prince by any of our generals to the people of rome
 you have , he said , everywhere a great reputation
it seemed better , however , to endure every hardship than to alienate the affections of all his allies , by submitting to such an insult .
 sylla , being deputed by caesar to take care of the camp , and having rescued his men , was satisfied with that , and did not desire to hazard a battle although this circumstance might probably have had a successful issue , that he might not be thought to have assumed the part of the general . 
 he at the same time instructed king antiochus to hasten to the provinces on his frontier , as pharasmanes , after having slain his son rhadamistus as a traitor to prove his loyalty to us , was following up more keenly than ever his old feud with the armenians
 vibius marsus moved that marcus lepidus , to whom the province of asia had been assigned , should have under him a special commissioner to undertake the charge of this temple
 they are in fact the most highly prized , indeed the only riches of the people
 there occurred too a thick succession of portents , which meant nothing
 upon this nero , though he did not repent of his outrage , restored to octavia her position as wife
 they threw them to the earth and beat them sorely , sixty to one , so as to correspond with the number of centurions
 it was resolved that the 18th cohort should be left there , as it was their usual winter quarters
 lately a praetor , a man of but moderate position and eager to become notorious by any sort of deed , afer charged her with unchastity , with having furnius for her paramour , and with attempts on the emperor by poison and sorcery
 the other , which repulsed the first attack , was reduced by blockade
although caesar considered it ruinous to leave the war and the enemy , yet , being well aware what great evils generally arise from internal dissensions , lest a state so powerful and so closely connected with the roman people , which he himself had always fostered and honored in every respect , should have recourse to violence and arms , and that the party which had less confidence in its own power should summon aid from vercingetorix , he determined to anticipate this movement ; and because , by the laws of the aedui , it was not permitted those who held the supreme authority to leave the country , he determined to go in person to the aedui , lest he should appear to infringe upon their government and laws , and summoned all the senate , and those between whom the dispute was , to meet him at decetia .
 tiberius favoured drusus , as his son and born of his own blood as for germanicus , his uncle's estrangement had increased the affection which all others felt for him , and there was the fact too that he had an advantage in the illustrious rank of his mother's family , among whom he could point to his grandfather marcus antonius and to his great-uncle augustus
 under this dread , fulcinius trio , unwilling to face an onslaught of accusers , inserted in his will several terrible imputations on macro and on the emperor's principal freedmen , while he taunted the emperor himself with the mental decay of old age , and the virtual exile of continuous retirement
 there it was noted , in this way , that he was drawing near his end
 several officers belonging to the two legions , which had been delivered up by caesar , were sent for . 
 sometimes he kept back the names of the candidates , describing their origin , their life and military career , so that it might be understood who they were
 he had made up nine legions of roman citizens ; five from italy , which he had brought with him ; one veteran legion from sicily , which being composed of two he called the gemella ; one from crete and macedonia , of veterans who had been discharged by their former generals and had settled in those provinces ; two from asia , which had been levied by the activity of lentulus . 
 from these men it was ascertained that interamna , situated in the adjoining plain , was occupied by a garrison of 400 cavalry
 consequently the information of proculus was useless , even though he reported what he had heard to nero
 one of the three under the command of cornelius scipio , blaesus's lieutenant , was to stop the enemy's forays on the leptitani and his retreat to the garamantes
 in the one case was the opportunity of solitude in the other , the very crowd which would witness so glorious a deed , had roused a singularly noble soul
 tribute is imposed on them as aliens , partly by the sarmatæ , partly by the quadi
 words went unpunished it was augustus who first , under colour of this law , applied legal inquiry to libellous writings provoked , as he had been , by the licentious freedom with which cassius severus had defamed men and women of distinction in his insulting satires
 a cohort of pannonians had been taken prisoners at cremona , a hundred cavalry , and a thousand of the levies from the fleet intercepted between placentia and ticinum
 after an interval of a few days there was a grand display on both sides on the one , cavalry ranged in squadrons with their national ensigns on the other , stood the columns of our legions with glittering eagles and standards and images of deities , after the appearance of a temple
 some the nearest vessels
 it was true , that while both were in a private station , flavius sabinus , who was the elder , was the superior of vespasian in influence and in wealth he was believed indeed to have sustained the failing credit of his brother , while taking a mortgage of his house and lands
 without ambition , without lawless violence , they live peaceful and secluded , never provoking a war or injuring others by rapine and robbery
 so singularly resolute was his spirit in curbing the license of the soldiery threats did not dismay him , nor flatteries seduce
 in their hands were flaming torches , which , as soon as they had carried out the spoil , they wantonly hurled into the gutted houses and plundered temples
 artabanus had now no resources but in some foreigners who guarded his person , men exiled from their own homes , who had no perception of honour , or any scruple about a base act , mere hireling instruments of crime
 a check too was put by several enactments of the people on evasions which , though continually put down , still , through strange artifices , reappeared
 relieved from apprehension by the legate's absence , the britons dwelt much among themselves on the miseries of subjection , compared their wrongs , and exaggerated them in the discussion
 as for the question of extortion , it was referred to a special commission
 a rumour had then spread itself among them that , dispersed and mingled with other tribes , they were to be dragged away to distant countries
 cerialis to wipe out his disgrace
these , from the similarity of their arms , greatly terrified our men ; and although they were discovered to have their right shoulders bare , which was usually the sign of those reduced to peace , yet the soldiers suspected that this very thing was done by the enemy to deceive them .
 attius , being brought before antonius , begged that he might be sent to caesar . 
 he did so for several days successively , by which means he was enabled to effect his march over the deepest rivers , and through the most intricate roads without any loss . 
 on the whole , one would say that their chief strength is in their infantry , which fights along with the cavalry
 by their concourse and declarations the timid were awed , the irresolute confirmed , and the greater part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments with freedom . 
 from which circumstances it happened that a few foot and aged men , that could prevail either through interest or pity , or who were able to swim to the ships , were taken on board , and landed safe in sicily . 
 germany , whence their strength is drawn , is faraway
 you are doubtless familiar with cicero's book , called brutus in the latter part of it the first gives an account of the ancient orators he relates his own beginnings , his progress , and the growth , so to say , of his eloquence
 when once the victory has been won , everything will be in your power
 but the money required for retaining in the service so vast a body of men was immensely large
 the emperor would have lent a ready ear , had not agrippina , by threats rather than entreaties , induced him to sentence the accuser to outlawry
 this force was accompanied by twenty cohorts of allied troops and eight squadrons of cavalry , by the two kings agrippa and sohemus , by the auxiliary forces of king antiochus , by a strong contingent of arabs , who hated the jews with the usual hatred of neighbours , and , lastly , by many persons brought from the capital and from italy by private hopes of securing the yet unengaged affections of the prince
they cease not to importune the neighboring germans and to promise them money : when they could not obtain from those nearest them , they try those more remote .
 but your provincial affairs are best known to yourselves
 he placed the eighth legion so close to the ninth , as to almost make one of the two , and ordered them to support one another . 
 this the emperor knew , and he therefore hesitated about bequeathing the empire , first , between his grandsons of these , the son of drusus was nearest in blood and natural affection , but he was still in his childhood germanicus's son was in the vigour of youth and enjoyed the people's favour , a reason for having his grandfather's hatred
 go back , they said , to the province which has not been rightfully taken from you , and is still vacant
 the rocks at its entrance suddenly fell in and crushed some of the attendants
 antonius himself failed not to provoke offence by his arrogance and his excessive propensity to dwell on his own services
 even unsuccessful villany finds some to emulate it 
 though the divine augustus in his public life enjoyed unshaken prosperity , he was unfortunate at home from the profligacy of his daughter and granddaughter , both of whom he banished from rome , and punished their paramours with death or exile
 indeed , some regard the relation as even more sacred and binding , and prefer it in receiving hostages , thinking thus to secure a stronger hold on the affections and a wider bond for the family but every man's own children are his heirs and successors , and there are no wills
 added to this was scarcity of water , a burning summer and long marches , all of which were alleviated only by the general's patient endurance
 in their rear rose a forest , with the branches rising to a great height , while there were clear spaces between the trunks
 as i promoted your victory to the utmost of my power by my sword and by my personal exertions , so now i must help you by prudence and by counsel , the qualities which belong peculiarly to a general
 when the senate was summoned to the chamber , it was hard for them to maintain in all things a safe moderation
 it may be that i do not satisfy you
the nation of the suevi is by far the largest and the most warlike nation of all the germans .
 no the fear was that as a wife at least she would divulge the wrongs of the senate , and the wrath of the people at the arrogance and rapacity of his mother
 accordingly , he ordered all the weaker soldiers , whose spirit or strength seemed unequal to the fatigue , to be selected from each century , and left them , with one legion besides , to guard the camp : the rest of the legions he drew out without any baggage , and , having disposed a great number of horses in the river , above and below the ford , he led his army over . 
 he sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the spoil and at the same time varus had detached as a guard for them six hundred numidian horse , and four hundred foot , which king juba had sent to utica as auxiliaries a few days before . 
 vinius had lived to the age of fifty-seven , with many changes of character
these having , after the destruction of their countrymen , been harassed for many years by their neighbors , while one time they waged war offensively , and at another resisted it when waged against them , concluded a peace with the consent of all , and chose this place as their settlement .
 the reports from the capital were unfavourable , while the disaffection of the colony of lugdunum , which obstinately adhered to nero , gave rise to a multitude of rumours
 i have given the man's very words , because they were not , like those of seneca , generally published , though the rough and vigorous sentiments of a soldier ought to be no less known
 on this occasion he who was applying the knot pretended that it had fallen off , and suddenly seizing the knees of mithridates flung him to the ground
 alarmed by the report of this increase to the army , the vitellianist cohorts began to waver no one urged them to fight , many urged them to change sides , each more eager than the other to hand over his company or troop , a present to the conqueror , and a source of future advantage to himself
 the war was a success for the hermunduri , and the more disastrous to the chatti because they had devoted , in the event of victory , the enemy's army to mars and mercury , a vow which consigns horses , men , everything indeed on the vanquished side to destruction
 appalled by the enormity and suddenness of the crime , or perhaps fearing that the troops were very extensively corrupted and that it would be destruction to oppose them , he made many suspect him of complicity
he orders those things which are necessary for equipping ships to be brought thither from spain .
 the barbarians who followed the two kings , lest they might disturb the peace of the provinces by mingling with the population , were settled beyond the danube between the rivers marus and cusus , under a king , vannius , of the nation of the quadi
 why are we not rather first in our repentance as we were last in the offence
his arrival being known from the color of his robe , and the troops of cavalry , and the cohorts which he had ordered to follow him being seen , as these low and sloping grounds were plainly visible from the eminences , the enemy join battle .
 for subsequent enactments , though occasionally directed against evildoers for some crime , were oftener carried by violence amid class dissensions , with a view to obtain honours not as yet conceded , or to banish distinguished citizens , or for other base ends
when the day which he had appointed with the embassadors came , and they returned to him ; he says , that he can not , consistently with the custom and precedent of the roman people , grant any one a passage through the province ; and he gives them to understand , that , if they should attempt to use violence he would oppose them .
 civilis , surrounding himself with the standards of the captured cohorts , to keep their recent honours before the eyes of his own men , and to terrify the enemy by the remembrance of defeat , now directed his own mother and sisters , and the wives and children of all his men , to stand in the rear , where they might encourage to victory , or shame defeat
he orders the whole province as great a number of soldiers as possible , as there was in all only one legion in further gaul : he orders the bridge at geneva to be broken down .
 the founder of the temple , according to old tradition , was king aerias , though some represent this as the name of the goddess herself
this he carries out bound about his javelin ; and mixing among the gauls without any suspicion by being a gaul , he reaches caesar .
to be unable to bear privation for a short time is disgraceful cowardice , not true valor .
the least elevation of ground , added to a declivity , exercises a momentous influence .
 as soon as he had dispelled the mist with which so astonishing a vicissitude had clouded his vision , he addressed the troops in a soldier-like style , and listened to the joyful intelligence that came pouring in from all quarters
 scipio , having staid for two days in his camp , along the river haliacmon , which ran between him and domitius's camp , on the third day , at dawn , led his army across a ford , and having made a regular encampment the day following , drew up his forces in front of his camp . 
 his mother , junia , was included in the accusation , as one who still resented the misfortune of exile which she had suffered in the past
 he was infamous for his cruelty , though he veiled his debaucheries , while he loved or feared sejanus
when caesar arrived in gaul , the aedui were the leaders of one faction , the sequani of the other .
 vinius was for marcus otho , laco and icelus agreed , not indeed in supporting any particular individual , but in striving for some one else
 germanicus accordingly , in the city of artaxata , with the approval of the nobility , in the presence of a vast multitude , placed the royal diadem on his head
 all these nations occupy but little of the plain country , dwelling in forests and on mountain-tops
 to like exertions and like persistency i would urge the prosecutors
 two squadrons of moesian and pannonian cavalry then broke through the enemy
 this fellow indeed actually charged the general with complicity he had , he said , acted as a messenger between civilis and flaccus , and because he might tell the truth he was now being crushed under a false charge
 death and sorrow were sure and no one had so escaped misfortune as to have no bereavement to lament
 but when not only the barley and fodder in these parts were consumed , and the herbs cut away , when the leaves too were not to be found on the trees , the horses being almost starved , pompey thought he ought to make some attempt by a sally . 
 the very easiness of galba's temper stimulated the greedy cupidity which great advancement had excited in his friends , because with one so weak and so credulous wrong might be done with less risk and greater gain
 that he had tampered with the soldiers , that his province had been at the mercy of the vilest of them , that he had even insulted his chief , he could not deny
 he had the same battle with his contemporaries which i have with you
 perhaps in any other matter , senators , it would be more convenient that i should be consulted in your presence , and then state what i think to be for the public good
crassus , having received their arms and hostages , marched into the territories of the vocates and the tarusates .
 and , besides , the times of business and relaxation were kept distinct
 they burnt , spoiled , and plundered , as if they were among the lands of the foreigner and the cities of a hostile people , and all with the more frightful effect as nowhere had there been made any provision against the danger
these , adopting the practice of the roman people , begin to select places , to fortify their camp , to cut off our men from provisions , which , when crassus observes , that his forces , on account of their small number could not safely be separated ; that the enemy both made excursions and beset the passes , and left sufficient guard for their camp ; that on that account , corn and provision could not very conveniently be brought up to him , and that the number of the enemy was daily increased , he thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle .
 for so great a storm arose , that it was agreed that there were never seen higher floods in those countries ; it swept down the snow from all the mountains , and broke over the banks of the river , and in one day carried away both the bridges which fabius had built- a circumstance which caused great difficulties to caesar's army . 
then , the other legions endeavored , through their military tribunes and the centurions of the principal companies , to excuse themselves to caesar , that they had never either doubted or feared , or supposed that the determination of the conduct of the war was theirs and not their general's .
 these are the men who last year under cover of darkness attacked a single legion , whom you routed by a shout
when he found that they did not even then come out he led back his army into camp about noon .
 the gauls encamped at a distance of two miles , and plied with bribes the centurions and soldiers who visited them there , striving to make a roman army commit the unheard of baseness of swearing allegiance to foreigners , and pledge itself to the perpetration of this atrocious crime by murdering or imprisoning its officers
 from these they expected considerable aid , both of horse and foot , and hoped to protract the war till winter , in a friendly country . 
 some of the troops remained permanently with herennius gallus
 for he had been informed that the whole province was inclined to favor caesar's party . 
 former alarms then returned , as there was a charge of treason against considius proculus
 but for the reasons already given , caesar did not attack them , nor suffer a tent to be pitched that day , that his men might be the readier to pursue them whether they attempted to run off by night or by day . 
 that deputies ought to be sent to pompey , to propose a reconciliation ; as he did not regard what pompey had lately asserted in the senate , that authority was acknowledged to be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were sent , and fear implied in those that sent them . 
 among the canninefates there was a certain brinno , a man of a certain stolid bravery and of distinguished birth
 but beside the father's haughty temper there was also the noble rank and wealth of his wife plancina , to inflame his ambition
 it was said , on the other hand , that filial duty and state necessity were merely assumed as a mask
 perplexed in mind , exhausted in body , he soon left to destiny a question to which he was unequal , though he threw out some hints from which it might be inferred that he foresaw what was to come
 from the number of settlers , the conveniences afforded by the rivers , the fertility of the soil , and the many connexions and intermarriages formed with neighbouring nations , it grew and flourished , unharmed by foreign enemies , though most unfortunate in civil wars
 acilius , as lieutenant-general , had the charge of this duty and the command of the town ; he drew the ships into the inner part of the harbor , behind the town , and fastened them to the shore , and sank a merchant-ship in the mouth of the harbor to block it up ; and near it he fixed another at anchor , on which he raised a turret , and faced it to the entrance of the port , and filled it with soldiers , and ordered them to keep guard against any sudden attack . 
 the senators hastily assembled and conferred by decree upon otho the tribunitial office , the name of augustus , and every imperial honour all strove to extinguish the remembrance of those taunts and invectives , which had been thrown out at random , and which no one supposed were rankling in his heart
 in civil strife , where action is more needed than deliberation , nothing is safer than haste
 titus himself had rome with all its wealth and pleasures before his eyes
 as soon as it was said that caesar was approaching , such a panic fell upon pompey's army , because in his haste he had made no distinction between night and day , and had marched without intermission , that they almost every man deserted their colors in epirus and the neighboring countries ; several threw down their arms , and their march had the appearance of a flight . 
 as it might be in some private household , each had his own motives , and the public honour now went for nothing
 nor are they as easily persuaded to plough the earth and to wait for the year's produce as to challenge an enemy and earn the honour of wounds
vercingetorix , when he had returned to his men , was accused of treason , in that he had moved his camp nearer the romans , in that he had gone away with all the cavalry , in that he had left so great forces without a commander , in that , on his departure , the romans had come at such a favorable season , and with such dispatch ; that all these circumstances could not have happened accidentally or without design ; that he preferred holding the sovereignty of gaul by the grant of caesar to acquiring it by their favor .
the ubii , who before had sent hostages and come to a capitulation , send embassadors to him , for the purpose of vindicating themselves , to assure him that neither had auxiliaries been sent to the treviri from their state , nor had they violated their allegiance ; they entreat and beseech him to spare them , lest , in his common hatred of the germans , the innocent should suffer the penalty of the guilty : they promise to give more hostages , if he desire them .
 at the same time he reminded them in confidential conversations of the wrongs which they had endured for so many years , while they falsely gave to a wretched slavery the name of peace
 it added to the men's joy that they had rescued from slavery after forty years some survivors of the defeat of varus
 he now at once administered to the eager soldiers the oath of allegiance to vespasian then he entered the theatre at antioch , where it is customary for the citizens to hold their public deliberations , and as they crowded together with profuse expressions of flattery , he addressed them
the day following caesar sent labienus , his legate , with those legions which he had brought back from britain , against the morini , who had revolted ; who , as they had no place to which they might retreat , on account of the drying up of their marshes , almost all fell into the power of labienus .
 circumcision was adopted by them as a mark of difference from other men
 priscus proposed that they should be chosen by name by the magistrates on oath , marcellus demanded the ballot and this had been the opinion expressed by the consul elect
 spain too , which then was without a governor of consular rank , showed no alacrity the legates of the three legions , equal in authority , and ready , while vitellius was prosperous , to vie in obedience , stood aloof with one consent from his falling fortunes in africa , the legion , and the auxiliary infantry levied by clodius macer and soon after disbanded by galba , again entered the service at the order of vitellius , while all the rest of the youth promptly gave in their names vitellius had ruled that province as proconsul with integrity and popularity
 and if it should be found necessary to throw up an embankment and to shelter ourselves under mantlets and hurdles , shall we stand baffled like a thoughtless mob , marvelling at the height of the towers and at the enemy's defences
 it having been resolved to give battle , it became a question whether it would be better for the emperor to be present in person , or to withdraw
 it was charged on lepida that she had made attempts on the emperor's consort by magical incantations , and was disturbing the peace of italy by an imperfect control of her troops of slaves in calabria
caesar , on being informed of this circumstance , sends several troops of horse to the place immediately after midnight ; he orders them to range in every quarter with more tumult than usual .
 thus most of the senate , intimidated by the expressions of the consul , by the fears of a present army , and the threats of pompey's friends , unwillingly and reluctantly adopted scipio's opinion , that caesar should disband his army by a certain day , and should he not do so , he should he considered as acting against the state . 
about the same time , publius crassus , when he had arrived in aquitania understanding that he was to wage war in these parts , where a few years before , lucius valerius praeconinus , the legate had been killed , and his army routed , and from which lucius manilius , the proconsul , had fled with the loss of his baggage , he perceived that no ordinary care must be used by him .
 great expectations were raised by his arrival
 meanwhile , after long reflection on his purpose and frequent deferment of it , the emperor retired into campania to dedicate , as he pretended , a temple to jupiter at capua and another to augustus at nola , but really resolved to live at a distance from rome
 however , almost at the same instant , news was received of the bridge being nearly completed over the ebro , and a ford was found in the segre . 
by these means , the troops which were lost at avaricum are speedily replaced .
 nor did pompey , as soon as he had notice of his design , make any delay to pursue him ; but with a view to surprise them while encumbered with baggage on their march , and not yet recovered from their fright , he led his army out of his camp , and sent his cavalry on to retard our rear ; but was not able to come up with them , because caesar had got far before him , and marched without baggage . 
the enemy , likewise , had drawn up their forces which they had brought out of the camp .
 the germans leapt lightly through the well-known shallows , and frequently , quitting the front , hung on the rear and flanks of our army
that these things were his concern ; that the sequani , the leuci , and the lingones were to furnish the corn ; and that it was already ripe in the fields ; that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves .
 quintus granius accused piso of secret treasonable conversation , and added that he kept poison in his house and wore a dagger whenever he came into the senate
 he then ordered the armoury to be opened
 the discipline of the army was relaxed by the brawls and quarrels which ensued
 for this fact had likewise been communicated
 at the same moment , to draw caesar's eyes away from her , he handed him some papers which detailed her debaucheries
 in the first conflict the soldiers of rome have been routed and vanquished
 it is more charitable to suppose that the mild temper of the man shrank from bloodshed and slaughter , and that for this reason he had held frequent conferences with vitellius to discuss the question of peace and the cessation of hostilities upon certain conditions
 vitellius , of having armed herself with a soldier's sword , and of having behaved with arrogance and cruelty amid the horrors and massacres of the storm of tarracina
 thence the general crossed into the country of the tauraunites , where he escaped an unforeseen peril
 the people of brundusium , irritated by the insolence of pompey's soldiers , and the insults received from pompey himself , were in favor of caesar's party . 
 he left a few cohorts to guard his baggage , and ordered the foragers to be called home at the tenth hour , and the horse to follow him . 
having proclaimed a council of gaul in the beginning of the spring , as he had been accustomed , when the deputies from the rest , except the senones , the carnutes , and the treviri , had come , judging this to be the commencement of war and revolt , that he might appear to consider all things of less consequence , he transfers the council to lutetia of the parisii .
 and even while at peace they have the same renown of valour
 burrus died , whether from illness or from poison was a question it was supposed to be illness from the fact that from the gradual swelling of his throat inwardly and the closing up of the passage he ceased to breathe
over all these druids one presides , who possesses supreme authority among them .
 it is not , however , usual for anyone to wear arms till the state has recognised his power to use them
 on our side there fell 360 men , and among them aulus atticus , the commander of the cohort , whose youthful impetuosity and mettlesome steed had borne him into the midst of the enemy
 that officer's wife , urged by a perverse curiosity to view the camp , entered it by night in the disguise of a soldier , and after extending the insulting frolic to the watches and the general arrangements of the army , actually dared to commit the act of adultery in the head-quarters vinius was charged with having participated in her guilt , and by order of caius was loaded with irons
 i believe that he had also at heart some care for the commonwealth , in vain , he would think , rescued from nero , if it was to be left with otho
 having delivered this message he marched to brundusium with six legions , four of them veterans : the rest those which he had raised in the late levy and completed on his march , for he had sent all domitius's cohorts immediately from corfinium to sicily . 
 it was through the influence of caecina and valens that they respectively rose to power
 in their ancient songs , their only way of remembering or recording the past , they celebrate an earth-born god , tuisco , and his son mannus , as the origin of their race , as their founders
 in the mean time they requested a truce , and obtained it from them ; for what they proposed seemed to be of importance , and it was well known that caesar desired it above all things , and it was imagined that some advantage would be derived from bibulus's proposals . 
 he showed him too the weapon prepared for his destruction , and bade him summon the accused scaevinus on being arrested by the soldiers began his defence with the reply that the dagger about which he was accused , had of old been regarded with a religious sentiment by his ancestors , that it had been kept in his chamber , and been stolen by a trick of his freedman he had often , he said , signed his will without heeding the observance of particular days , and had previously given presents of money as well as freedom to some of his slaves , only on this occasion he gave more freely , because , as his means were now impoverished and his creditors were pressing him , he distrusted the validity of his will
 the emperor , too , was as excessive in his grief as he had been in his joy
 therefore , as soon as they were aware of pompey's departure , while his men were running up and down , and busied about their voyage , they made signs from the tops of the houses : caesar , being apprised of the design by them , ordered scaling-ladders to be got ready , and his men to take arms , that he might not lose any opportunity of coming to an action . 
 bassus , with his unobtrusive energy , was ready for everything that had to be done
 laws are ordained to meet facts , inasmuch as the future is uncertain
 first , the twelve tables prohibited any one from exacting more than 10 per cent , when , previously , the rate had depended on the caprice of the wealthy
 the originator of the movement was titus curtisius , once a soldier of the praetorian guard first , by secret meetings at brundisium and the neighbouring towns , then by placards publicly exhibited , he incited the rural and savage slave-population of the remote forests to assert their freedom by divine providence , three vessels came to land for the use of those who traversed that sea in the same part of the country too was curtius lupus , the quaestor , who , according to ancient precedent , had had the charge of the woodland pastures assigned to him
 a client of soranus , and now hired to ruin his friend , he professed the dignified character of a stoic , and had trained himself in demeanour and language to exhibit an ideal of virtue in his heart , however , treacherous and cunning , he concealed greed and sensuality
 he would not , he said , be judge in all cases , or , by confining the accuser and the accused within the same walls , let the power of a few favourites grow dangerously formidable
 but to reprimand , to imprison , even to flog , is permitted to the priests alone , and that not as a punishment , or at the general's bidding , but , as it were , by the mandate of the god whom they believe to inspire the warrior
 only a few were admitted to be accomplices in the plot , but they worked by various devices on the wavering minds of the remainder on the more distinguished soldiers , by hinting that the favours of nymphidius had subjected them to suspicion on the vulgar herd , by the anger and despair with which the repeated postponement of the donative had inspired them
 there he received nothing but gloomy intelligence , that sabinus was dead , that the capitol had been burnt to the ground , that rome was in consternation , and also that the populace and the slaves were arming themselves for vitellius
 behold , young man , and may the gods avert the omen , but you have been born into times in which it is well to fortify the spirit with examples of courage
 calling himself the champion of gaul , and a god for he had assumed this title , he had now collected 8000 men , and was taking possession of the neighbouring villages of the aedui , when that most formidable state attacked him with a picked force of its native youth , to which vitellius attached some cohorts , and dispersed the crowd of fanatics
 the leading men of the equestrian order sympathised most closely with the joy of the senators
 as if indeed scipio's and cato's vengeance fell on such offences , or that of the famous scaurus , whom his great grandson , a blot on his ancestry , this mamercus was now disgracing by his infamous occupation
moreover , when caesar addressed the legions , one by one , when at work , and said that he would raise the siege , if they felt the scarcity too severely , they unanimously begged him not to do so ; that they had served for several years under his command in such a manner that they never submitted to insult , and never abandoned an enterprise without accomplishing it ; that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned the siege after commencing it ; that it was better to endure every hardship than to not avenge the names of the roman citizens who perished at genabum by the perfidy of the gauls .
 when drusus pleaded in answer reference to the senate and to his father , he was interrupted by a tumultuous shout
 is this apology meant to be offered for all without difference and discrimination
 martius , who was a man of energy , conveyed his gladiators in boats across the padus , and suddenly threw them upon the opposite bank
 at last , as pollio pleaded the overpowering numbers of the enemy and rhadamistus the orders of his father , the centurion stipulated for a truce and retired , intending , if he could not deter pharasmanes from further hostilities , to inform ummidius quadratus , the governor of syria , of the state of armenia
 those who had opposed him , in moderate terms the majority met him with an officious homage , having aims of their own and no thought for the state
 later accounts tell us that the temple was consecrated by cinyras , and that the goddess herself after her birth from the sea was wafted to this spot , but that the wisdom and craft of the diviners was a foreign importation introduced by tamiras of cilicia and that it was agreed that the descendants of both families should preside over the worship
 of rome meanwhile , so much as was left unoccupied by his mansion , was not built up , as it had been after its burning by the gauls , without any regularity or in any fashion , but with rows of streets according to measurement , with broad thoroughfares , with a restriction on the height of houses , with open spaces , and the further addition of colonnades , as a protection to the frontage of the blocks of tenements
 moreover , scipio ordered the money formerly lodged in the temple of diana at ephesus , to be taken out with the statues of that goddess , which remained there . 
 his family could boast an ancient nobility , his wealth was great
 , senators , if we look to the single fact of the infamous utterance with which lutorius has polluted his own mind and the ears of the public , neither dungeon nor halter nor tortures fit for a slave would be punishment enough for him
 is it surprising that , with so many distracting cares , foreseeing too the immense elevation to which a man would be raised above others by such an alliance , he talked of caius proculeius and certain persons of singularly quiet life , wholly free from political entanglements
 at last the king yielded , all the positions fortified by corbulo beyond the euphrates were destroyed , and the armenians too left without a master
 some have said that he was recognised by chauci serving among the roman auxiliaries , who let him go
and thus , since that business was executed by the soldiers with the greatest energy , he effected that , after the loss of twelve ships , a voyage could be made well enough in the rest .
 those who wished for battle with its prompt decision argued that ill-arrayed levies fatigued by a long march could not even in heart be thoroughly united in obedience , traitors and enemies as they had lately been , to the prince whom now again they were supporting
 in a part of the same letter he sneered at female friendships , with an indirect censure on the consul fufius , who had risen to distinction through augusta's partiality
 when caesar's letter was delivered to the consuls , they were with great difficulty , and a hard struggle of the tribunes , prevailed on to suffer it to be read in the senate ; but the tribunes could not prevail , that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the letter . 
caesar , leaving a strong guard at each end of the bridge , hastens into the territories of the sugambri .
 some rush from the camp ; an attack is made on the enemy : but they were prevented , by arrows and engines from the walls ; from pursuing them when they fled . 
these quickly took fire , and by the violence of the wind , scattered their flames in every part of the camp .
 accusers were also found who alleged that our allies had been plundered , when suilius governed the province of asia , and that there had been embezzlement of public monies
 even as it is , feminine jealousies break out , and my grandsons are torn asunder by the strife
 the emperor in the same year asked the senate for a statue to his father domitius , and also that the consular decorations might be conferred on asconius labeo , who had been his guardian
 others are paralysed by it it is not possible for a prince's knowledge to embrace everything , and it is not expedient that he should be exposed to the ambitious schemings of others
 when libo saw them advancing boldly toward him , he sent five four-banked galleys against them , in hopes of intercepting them . 
 either by chance or purposely seneca had returned on that day from campania , and had stopped at a countryhouse four miles from rome
 the mob and the people generally , whose vast numbers cut them off from all interest in the state , began by degrees to feel the evils of war , now that all the currency had been diverted to the purposes of the army , and the prices of provisions were raised these evils had not equally distressed the common people during the insurrection of vindex the capital was safe , and the war was in the provinces , and , fought as it was between the legions and gaul , it seemed but a foreign campaign
he devised this plan of a bridge .
 though at the moment provoked , he only called on the tribunes of the people to support his insulted authority , and then , when his friends , who feared his resentment was deeper than it appeared , sought to appease him , he replied that it was nothing strange that two senators in a commonwealth should disagree 
 the general's plan was backed up by the energy of the troops these were divided into two columns and those who marched to the left cut off the plunderers , just on their return , after a riotous enjoyment of their spoil , when they were heavy with sleep
 when they were brought before him he protected them from the insolence and taunts of the soldiers ; told them in few words that they had not made him a grateful return , on their part , for his very extraordinary kindness to them , and dismissed them all in safety . 
 the roman army was drawn up to meet them not far from the river rhine , and the ships , which , after burning the forts , they had stranded at that point , were arranged so as to front the enemy
to these he adds a few cavalry , with instructions to range more widely to make a show .
 ulysses , too , is believed by some , in his long legendary wanderings , to have found his way into this ocean , and , having visited german soil , to have founded and named the town of asciburgium , which stands on the bank of the rhine , and is to this day inhabited
cassivellaunus , as we have stated above , all hope of battle being laid aside , the greater part of his forces being dismissed , and about 4 , 000 charioteers only being left , used to observe our marches and retire a little from the road , and conceal himself in intricate and woody places , and in those neighborhoods in which he had discovered we were about to march , he used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from the fields into the woods ; and , when our cavalry , for the sake of plundering and ravaging the more freely , scattered themselves among the fields , he used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the well-known roads and paths , and to the great danger of our horse , engage with them ; and this source of fear hindered them from straggling very extensively .
 he is in eager haste to have the sole control of the province and the legions
 the enemy advanced from every quarter in several bodies
 the provinces , two of which were consular , the remainder praetorian , were decreed to private persons ; scipio got syria , lucius domitius gaul : philip and marcellus were omitted , from a private motive , and their lots were not even admitted . 
when they were recognized and the treachery of litavicus discovered , the aedui began to extend their hands to intimate submission , and , laying down their arms , to deprecate death .
 now the legions and the fleets were brought into action , and with them a force used but on few other occasions , the praetorian and city soldiery in their rear were the provinces of the east and of the west with all their forces had they fought under other generals there was all the material for a protracted war
 the massilians made the same attempt the next day , having got such another storm . 
 hence the gracchi and saturnini , those popular agitators , and drusus too , as flagrant a corrupter in the senate's name
 they called their neighbours , not allies as of old , but the enemy and the vanquished
these beams were bound together by timber laid over them , in the direction of the length of the bridge , and were covered over with laths and hurdles ; and in addition to this , piles were driven into the water obliquely , at the lower side of the bridge , and these , serving as buttresses , and being connected with every portion of the work , sustained the force of the stream : and there were others also above the bridge , at a moderate distance ; that if trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the river by the barbarians for the purpose of destroying the work , the violence of such things might be diminished by these defenses , and might not injure the bridge .
 though a traitor to galba he was loyal to vitellius , and gained a lustre from the perfidy of others
within ten days after the timber began to be collected , the whole work was completed , and the whole army led over .
 but the glory of its completion was reserved for the days of liberty
 his father was of a praetorian family , his maternal grandfather was one of the proscribed
 but to the enemy he was a laughing-stock , for they still retained some of the fire of liberty , knowing nothing yet of the power of freedmen , and so they marvelled to see a general and an army who had finished such a war cringing to slaves
 inferior in military strength , but deriving an advantage from the deceptiveness of the country , he at once shifted the war by a stratagem into the territory of the ordovices , where , joined by all who dreaded peace with us , he resolved on a final struggle he selected a position for the engagement in which advance and retreat alike would be difficult for our men and comparatively easy for his own , and then on some lofty hills , wherever their sides could be approached by a gentle slope , he piled up stones to serve as a rampart
 tarraco lay at a greater distance ; and in such a space they knew affairs might admit of many changes . 
 they also handed him a gift denoting friendship , a golden crown , which he acknowledged in complimentary language
 he wore a splendid military cloak , she , a mantle of cloth of gold a battle was fought with all the courage of brave men , though it was between condemned criminals
when this letter was brought to him about the middle of the night , caesar apprises his soldiers of its contents , and inspires them with courage for fighting : the following day , at the dawn , he moves his camp , and , having proceeded four miles , he espies the forces of the enemy on the other side of a considerable valley and rivulet .
 labeo made his escape before he could be intercepted
 nero had added to their reputation by selecting them as his most effective troops
 the cause was a mystery all else was at the disposal of chance even some loyal men were slain , for , on its being once understood who were the objects of fury , some of the worst mutineers too had seized on weapons
 their whole strength is in their infantry , which , in addition to its arms , is laden with iron tools and provisions
 some of the chiefs , anxious to seem the first to cease from hostilities , fled to those states which had not renounced the roman alliance
caesar , having sent his cavalry on before , followed close after them with all his forces ; but the plan and order of the march was different from that which the belgae had reported to the nervii .
cicero himself , though he was in very weak health , did not leave himself the night-time for repose , so that he was forced to spare himself by the spontaneous movement and entreaties of the soldiers .
 but i will relate the deaths of others with the remaining events of that time , if after finishing the work i have now proposed to myself , i prolong my life for further labours
he directs him , if he should be unable to enter , to throw his spear with the letter fastened to the thong , inside the fortifications of the camp .
 and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of augustus , till growing sycophancy scared them away
 the latter , besides the more usual military distinctions , particularly excel in the organisation of cavalry , and the chatti are not more famous for their foot-soldiers than are the tencteri for their horsemen
 consequently , in a state which had the support of so many great men , they should not put everything on one man , as many , by uniting their efforts would more easily discharge public functions
 the praetor of the city summoned the senate the rest of the magistrates vied with each other in their flatteries
 they gave the proconsul poison at a banquet , too openly to escape discovery
 without making any delay in any part of macedonia , he marched with great haste against domitius ; and when he was come within about twenty miles of him , wheeled on a sudden toward cassius longinus in thessaly . 
 to those who inquired the reason of his departure , otho pretended that he was purchasing certain farm-buildings , which from their age he suspected to be unsound , and which had therefore to be first surveyed leaning on his freedman's arm , he proceeded through the palace of tiberius to the velabrum , and thence to the golden milestone near the temple of saturn
all the sea coast being quickly brought over to their sentiments , they send a common embassy to publius crassus , if he wished to receive back his officers , let him send back to them their hostages .
 vespasian was at one moment high in hope , and at another disposed to reflect on the chances of failure
the aedui request vercingetorix to come to them and communicate his plans of conducting the war .
 lucius caesar the son , who was waiting his arrival near clupea with ten ships which had been taken near utica in a war with the pirates , and which publius attius had had repaired for this war , frightened at the number of our ships , fled the sea , and running his three-decked covered galley on the nearest shore , left her there and made his escape by land to adrumetum . 
but indutiomarus began to collect cavalry and infantry , and make preparations for war , having concealed those who by reason of their age could not be under arms , in the forest arduenna , which is of immense size , extends from the rhine across the country of the treveri to the frontiers of the remi .
 the leading men were allowed freedom of discussion , and when they stooped to flattery , the emperor himself checked them
 this caused ruin for many who conjectured that his end was near and spread the rumour
 the enemy fortified the hill , about which the contest had been , with strong works and posted a garrison on it . 
 it was your excessive affection for me that roused you to act with more zeal than discretion
 but varro was in greater haste on this account to reach gades with his legion as soon as possible , lest he should be stopped either on his march or on crossing over to the island . 
 in short , they said that it was better bravely to try the hazard of war in a battle , than to be deserted and surrounded by their own troops , and forced to submit to the greatest cruelties . 
 both had a graceful person and were of noble birth neither had much exceeded thirty years of age , and both fell by the treachery of their own people in strange lands
 he chose a position approached by a narrow defile , closed in at the rear by a forest , having first ascertained that there was not a soldier of the enemy except in his front , where an open plain extended without any danger from ambuscades
 who the more goes back to his home saved from danger and bound to you
the occasion of that war was this : publius crassus , a young man , had taken up his winter quarters with the seventh legion among the andes , who border upon the ocean .
 when varus , after been repeatedly called , stopped and looked at him , and inquired who he was and what he wanted , he made a blow with his sword at his naked shoulder and was very near killing varus , but he escaped the danger by raising his shield to ward off the blow . 
 i am but one of the senate which bows to the same yoke
 caecina , after crossing the padus , sought to tamper with the loyalty of the othonianists at a conference in which he held out hopes of reward , and he was himself assailed with the same arts after the specious but meaningless names of peace and concord had been thus bandied to and fro , caecina turned all his thoughts and plans on the capture of placentia , making a formidable show of preparation , as he knew that according to the success of his opening operations would be the subsequent prestige of his arms
 cluvius was attached to the emperor's retinue spain however was not taken from him he still governed the province though not resident , as l
 it was imputed to them as a crime that their great-grandfather theophanes of mitylene had been one of the intimate friends of pompey the great , and that after his death greek flattery had paid him divine honours

 whenever either side gave way , they cried out that those who concealed themselves in the shops , or took refuge in any private house , should be dragged out and butchered , and they secured the larger share of the booty
 he spoke a few words to the same purport from himself , in addition to pompey's apology . 
 spartans founded the place because canopus , pilot of one of their ships , had been buried there , when menelaus on his return to greece was driven into a distant sea and to the shores of libya
 but when cerialis came up with a picked body of cavalry , the fortune of the day changed , and the germans were driven headlong into the river
 very different was the tendency of tiberius's character
 undoubtedly it was under such teachers that the youth of whom i am speaking , the disciple of orators , the listener in the forum , the student in the law-courts , was trained and practised by the experiences of others the laws he learnt by daily hearing the faces of the judges were familiar to him the ways of popular assemblies were continually before his eyes he had frequent experience of the ear of the people , and whether he undertook a prosecution or a defence , he was at once singly and alone equal to any case
 even if his reading is followed by a complete success , all the glory is , so to say , cut short in the bloom and the flower , and does not come to any real and substantial fruit he carries away with him not a single friendship , not a single client , not an obligation that will abide in anyone's mind , only idle applause , meaningless acclamations and a fleeting delight
 but flaccus abandoned his purpose , and , in other despatches to gallus , recommended him not to threaten the departing foe
 when an opportunity presents itself , either in the senate , or in a popular assembly , i shall not be silent
 the prosecutors , eprius and cossutianus , received each five million sesterces , ostorius twelve hundred thousand , with the decorations of the quaestorship
 not only did a strong detachment of the praetorian cohorts , of the bodyguard , and of the cavalry , depart with him , but the spirit of those who remained was broken , for the men suspected their generals , and otho , who alone had the confidence of the soldiers , while he himself trusted in none but them , had left the generals' authority on a doubtful footing
 some with the frolicsome humour of slaves robbed the careless soldiers by slily cutting their belts , and then asked them whether they were armed
 he did not indeed err from dulness , and it is easy to see when the acts of a sovereign meet with genuine , and when with fictitious popularity
the report is quickly spread among all the states of gaul ; for , whenever a more important and remarkable event takes place , they transmit the intelligence through their lands and districts by a shout ; the others take it up in succession , and pass it to their neighbors , as happened on this occasion ; for the things which were done at genabum at sunrise , were heard in the territories of the arverni before the end of the first watch , which is an extent of more than a hundred and sixty miles .
 accordingly scaevinus , in answer to his browbeating and menaces , said with a smile that no one knew more than he did , and actually urged him to show gratitude to so good a prince
 paetus then went into winter quarters in cappadocia
 at the fourth milestone from cremona glittered the standards of two legions , the italica and the rapax , which had been advanced as far as that point during the success achieved by the first movement of their cavalry but when fortune changed , they would not open their ranks , nor receive the fugitives , nor advance and themselves attack an enemy now exhausted by so protracted a pursuit and conflict
 he had resolved to fix his winter quarters at dyrrachium , apollonia , and the other seaports , to hinder caesar from passing the sea : and for this purpose had stationed his fleet along the sea-coast . 
 some attributed this to modesty many to self-distrust
 nero from early boyhood turned his lively genius in other directions
 so long have we been in conquering germany
 being elated by all these things , he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing against him . 
 he at once addressed himself to answer them , and thus harangued the assembled senate my ancestors , the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and a noble of rome , encourage me to govern by the same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit , wherever found
 when the deputies met the next day , a great multitude from both sides assembled , and the expectations of every person concerning this subject were raised very high , and their minds seemed to be eagerly disposed for peace . 
 being left on the road with a small number , he fell in with vibullius rufus , who was sent by pompey into picenum to confirm the people in their allegiance . 
 the games too of ceres in the circus were to be celebrated with more horse-races , and the month of april was to be called after the name of nero
the third side is toward the north , to which portion of the island no land is opposite ; but an angle of that side looks principally toward germany .
that those who ascribed their fear to a pretense about the supplies and the narrowness of the roads , acted presumptuously , as they seemed either to distrust their general's discharge of his duty , or to dictate to him .
 in the consulship of lentulus gaetulicus and caius calvisius , triumphal distinctions were decreed to poppaeus sabinus , for a crushing defeat of some thracian tribes , whose wild life in the highlands of a mountainous country made them unusually fierce
gaius valerius procillus , as he was being dragged by his guards in the fight , bound with a triple chain , fell into the hands of caesar himself , as he was pursuing the enemy with his cavalry .
 roman lust has gone so far that not our very persons , nor even age or virginity , are left unpolluted
 peace and harmony bring advantage to the conquered , but only credit to the conqueror
 when his wife spurned the notion , protesting that she was a descendant of the divine augustus and could face peril with no degenerate spirit , he at last embraced her and the son of their love with many tears , and after long delay compelled her to depart
 the result was an alternation of outbreaks and executions , and a strange mixture of obedience and frenzy , which made it impossible to restrain the men whom it was yet possible to punish
 her mother , who surpassed in personal attractions all the ladies of her day , had bequeathed to her alike fame and beauty
 thus the safety of the whole army depended on a very short space of time and a great casualty . 
 our soldiers on the other side drove them back with missiles , repelled them with their shields , and covered them with a storm of long siege-javelins and heaps of stones
 hitherto the people had been compelled to endure the farce of waiting by the closed granary and of purchasing corn unnecessarily and raising it to a fictitious price
 the remaining inhabitants soon returned to cremona
 you prefer the glory of dying i will not grudge you such a noble example
 an immense multitude from the neighbouring towns , others from rome itself , eager to see the sight or to show respect to the emperor , crowded the banks , the hills , and mountain tops , which thus resembled a theatre
 there is nothing of which barbarians are so ignorant as military engines and the skilful management of sieges , while that is a branch of military science which we especially understand
 the woman who had long been nero's mistress and ruled him first as a paramour , then as her husband , instigated one of octavia's servants to accuse her an intrigue with a slave
 they had accomplices in all who feared the same fate
 no one enters it except bound with a chain , as an inferior acknowledging the might of the local divinity if he chance to fall , it is not lawful for him to be lifted up , or to rise to his feet
 by these and like appeals they collected a large force no less numerous were the partisans of italicus
 pomponia graecina , a distinguished lady , wife of the plautius who returned from britain with an ovation , was accused of some foreign superstition and handed over to her husband's judicial decision
 vinicius was of provincial descent
 never had he contemplated such a pitch of disaster , as that these tribes should themselves advance to attack our legions
 but he was soon discovered
they use either brass or iron rings , determined at a certain weight , as their money .
then labienus , as the change in affairs was so great , thought that he must adopt a very different system from what he had previously intended , and he did not now think of making any new acquisitions , or of provoking the enemy to an action ; but that he might bring back his army safe to agendicum .
 are these the tidings which i shall have to carry to my father when he hears only joyful intelligence from our other provinces , that his own recruits , his own veterans are not satisfied with discharge or pay
 there , their own success proved hurtful to the germans , for , throwing away their arms , they hampered their hands with plunder
 and so we prepared three expeditions and as many columns
 his brother had gone but one day's journey to meet him
 he pleaded with caesar for his life , and entreated him to spare him , and reminded him of their former friendship ; and acknowledged that caesar's favors to him were very great ; in that through his interest he had been admitted into the college of priests ; in that after his praetorship he had been appointed to the government of spain ; in that he had been assisted by him in his suit for the consulate . 
they themselves did not hesitate to pass the river ; and having advanced to a disadvantageous place , when the battle was renewed , they again put to flight the enemy , who had returned and were opposing them .
 and they now began to dispute openly about rewards and priesthoods , and disposed of the consulate for several years to come others put in their claims for the houses and properties of all who were in caesar's camp , and in that council there was a warm debate , whether lucius hirtius , who had been sent by pompey against the parthians , should be admitted a candidate for the praetorship in his absence at the next election ; his friends imploring pompey's honor to fulfill the engagements which he had made to him at his departure , that he might not seem deceived through his authority : while others , embarked in equal labor and danger , pleaded that no individual ought to have a preference before all the rest . 
 but this did not make blaesus more famous , while the refusal of the honour heightened dolabella's renown
 the envoys remained with vitellius too readily to let it be supposed that they were detained
 you indeed desire to keep within your station
 while these things were going forward in achaia and at dyrrachium , and when it was certainly known that scipio was arrived in macedonia , caesar , never losing sight of his first intention , sends clodius to him , an intimate friend to both , whom caesar , on the introduction and recommendation of pompey , had admitted into the number of his acquaintance . 
 he collected the chief men of the island , and explained his plans claudius pyrrhicus , captain of the liburnian ships stationed in the place , and quintius certus , a roman knight , who ventured to offer opposition , he ordered to execution
 night and weariness of bloodshed put an end to the pursuit
 he boasted so arrogantly and persistently that his father's prolonged old age kept back from him the little kingdom of iberia as to make no concealment of his ambition
having pitched their camp fifteen miles off , they resolve to await the support of the germans .
 there were some who recognized the very style of speaking , which was well known from his constant pleading at the bar , and which sought to fill the popular ear with a copious and sonorous diction
 that the gods to whom they appealed , had willed that the decision as to what should be given or taken from them , was to rest with the romans , who would allow none but themselves to be judges
 the next day vitellius , after giving audience to the envoys from the senate whom he had ordered to wait for him there , proceeded to the camp , and actually bestowed high praise on the loyalty of the soldiers the auxiliary troops loudly complained that such complete impunity , such privileged arrogance , was accorded to the legions
fortune thus taking a turn , surround on every side , and slay those who had entertained the hope of gaining the camp and having killed more than the third part of an army of more than 30 , 000 men , put to flight the rest when panic-stricken , and do not suffer them to halt even upon the higher grounds .
 mela , son of the same parents as gallio and seneca , had refrained from seeking promotion out of a perverse vanity which wished to raise a roman knight to an equality with ex-consuls
 the crew then thought it best to throw the vessel on one side and so sink it , but they could not themselves promptly unite to face the emergency , and others , by counteracting the attempt , gave an opportunity of a gentler fall into the sea acerronia , however , thoughtlessly exclaiming that she was agrippina , and imploring help for the emperor's mother , was despatched with poles and oars , and such naval implements as chance offered agrippina was silent and was thus the less recognized
 even among many legions , it is a few who really decide the battle , and it will enhance their glory that a small force should earn the renown of an entire army
 legions had been sent into armenia , and other legions were ready to rush to the attack on behalf of syria , while his own cavalry was crippled by want of food
 the other slaves are not employed after our manner with distinct domestic duties assigned to them , but each one has the management of a house and home of his own
 cluvius's account , however , is also that of all other authors , and popular belief inclines to it , whether it was that agrippina really conceived such a monstrous wickedness in her heart , or perhaps because the thought of a strange passion seemed comparatively credible in a woman , who in her girlish years had allowed herself to be seduced by lepidus in the hope of winning power , had stooped with a like ambition to the lust of pallas , and had trained herself for every infamy by her marriage with her uncle
 when caesar had approached near pompey's camp , he observed that his army was drawn up in the following manner : on the left wing were the two legions , delivered over by caesar at the beginning of the disputes in compliance with the senate's decree , one of which was called the first , the other the third . 
 what would happen if their thoughts were fixed on promotion for five years
they are said there to learn by heart a great number of verses ; accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty years .
 the rhine and the gods of germany are in your sight
 italy beyond the padus is shut in by the alps , cannot be relieved from the sea , and has been exhausted by the passage of his army
 it is not here , as it is among nations despotically ruled , that there is a distinct governing family , while all the rest are slaves
 at the same time it was becoming evident , from the devastation of the country and from the flames of burning houses , that the victorious army was approaching
 at altinum a force was left to oppose the ravenna fleet , the defection of which from vitellius was not yet known
 then followed a short conversation between the generals while corbulo complained that his efforts had been fruitless and that the war might have been ended with the flight of the parthians , paetus replied that for neither of them was anything lost , and urged that they should reverse the eagles , and with their united forces invade armenia , much weakened , as it was , by the departure of vologeses
immediately after midnight , the cavalry are sent out and overtake the rear , a great number are taken or cut to pieces , the rest by flight escape in different directions to their respective states .
 nor is any production of asinius or messala so famous as ovid's medea or the thyestes of varius
he supposed that they were then waiting for these horse , and that the delay was caused on this account .
but the system of cavalry engagement is wont to produce equal danger , and indeed the same , both to those who retreat and to those who pursue .
 he had nearly completed his 57th year his consulate , his priesthood , his high reputation , his place among the first men of the state , he owed , not to any energy of his own , but to the renown of his father
 but the commanding situation of the city had been strengthened by enormous works which would have been a thorough defence even for level ground
 with a profuse liberality , he granted treaties to allies , and the rights of latin citizenship to foreigners
 crispinus then entered on a line of life afterwards rendered notorious by the miseries of the age and men's shamelessness
caesar clearly points out to his soldiers , who were indignant that the enemy could bear the sight of them at the distance of so short a space , and were earnestly demanding the signal for action , with how great loss and the death of how many gallant men the victory would necessarily be purchased : and when he saw them so determined to decline no danger for his renown , that he ought to be considered guilty of the utmost injustice if he did not hold their life dearer than his personal safety .
 though i am not yet what they were , still , descended as i am from them , it would be a strange and unworthy thing should i be spurned by the soldiery of spain or syria
 meanwhile , pretending that she felt secure , she applied remedies to her wound , and fomentations to her person
 he appealed , by name , to their forefathers who had driven back the dictator caesar , by whose valour they were free from the roman axe and tribute , and still preserved inviolate the persons of their wives and of their children
 the time and the place however made him hesitate he knew that a massacre once begun is not easily checked
 the words of their conversation had two witnesses in cluvius rufus and silius italicus
 he had proceeded a few days' march , when he received intelligence of the victory at bedriacum , and of the termination of the war through otho's death
 he had , in fact , with a smaller army , brought back with him illustrious prisoners and the fame of having slain the enemy's leader and terminated the war
 and therefore , while you are yet stainless and undisgraced , seek to close life with the glory of those in whose track and pursuits you have passed it
 other nations in their ignorance of roman rule , have no experience of punishments , know nothing of tributes , and , as we have shaken them off , as the great augustus , ranked among dieties , and his chosen heir tiberius , departed from us , baffled , let us not quail before an inexperienced stripling , before a mutinous army
 in a word , are they , instead of the neros and the drusi , to control the empire of the roman people
 the word went through the companies that all were to aim at securing tacfarinas , whom , after so many battles , they knew well , as there would be no rest from war except by the destruction of the enemy's leader
 nothing is now safe from their avarice , nothing from their lust
finding a ford there , they endeavored to lead a part of their forces over it ; with the design , that , if they could , they might carry by storm the fort which quintus titurius , caesar's legate , commanded , and might cut off the bridge ; but , if they could not do that , they should lay waste the lands of the remi , which were of great use to us in carrying on the war , and might hinder our men from foraging .
 there had been seen hosts joining battle in the skies , the fiery gleam of arms , the temple illuminated by a sudden radiance from the clouds
 meanwhile , as they hesitated in prolonged suspense between hope and fear , a certain epicharis how she informed herself is uncertain , as she had never before had a thought of anything noble began to stir and upbraid the conspirators
 his dress and appearance hardly distinguished him from the common soldier
 he requires of them all , to assist him with corn , to which they agreed , and having collected all the cattle in the country , they convey them into his camp . 
 they sit apart at meals , they sleep apart , and though , as a nation , they are singularly prone to lust , they abstain from intercourse with foreign women
 granting that his body , because of the distance of tie journey , was burnt in any fashion in foreign lands , still all the more honours ought to have been afterwards paid him , because at first chance had denied them
 this is the name both of the mountain and the deity
 he shut himself into his chamber a physician was at his side his veins were opened with life still strong in him , he was carried into a bath , and plunged into warm water , without uttering a word of pity for himself
 it will be enough to mention the most powerful , which are the harii , the helvecones , the manimi , the helisii and the nahanarvali
 the breakers of treaties may look for the vengeance of the same deities , and the same doom
 still , that the passage into italy might be safe and advantageous , directions were sent to aponius saturninus to hasten up with the armies of moesia that the provinces might not be exposed without defence to the barbarian tribes , the princes of the sarmatae iazyges , who had in their hands the government of that nation , were enrolled in the army
 heaven has intrusted you with the supreme decision of affairs , and for us is left the glory of obedience
 this done , he returned with the legions to syria
 for the greatness of the roman people has spread reverence for our empire beyond the rhine and the old boundaries
 this method of conducting a war was new and unusual , as well on account of the number of forts , the extent and greatness of the works , and the manner of attack and defense , as on account of other circumstances . 
 what an extent of plain , he would say , lies open into which the flocks and herds of the roman soldiers may some day be sent ! let them by all means keep retreats for their cattle , while men are starving only let them not prefer a waste and a solitude to friendly nations
this spot was at nearly an equal distance from both camps .
 up to this time he is regarded as a member of a household , afterwards as a member of the commonwealth
 and , if the same lot awaits the innocent and the guilty , the man of spirit will at least deserve his fate
 then caesar addressed himself to his soldiers , when they were at the gates of the camp , ready to march out we must defer , says he , our march at present , and set our thoughts on battle , which has been our constant wish ; let us then meet the foe with resolute souls . 
a great many ships having been wrecked , inasmuch as the rest , having lost their cables , anchors , and other tackling , were unfit for sailing , a great confusion , as would necessarily happen , arose throughout the army ; for there were no other ships in which they could be conveyed back , and all things which are of service in repairing vessels were wanting , and , corn for the winter had not been provided in those places , because it was understood by all that they would certainly winter in gaul .
but those within , while they bring forward those things which had been prepared by vercingetorix for a sally , fill up the nearest trenches ; having delayed a long time in executing these movements , they learned the retreat of their countrymen before they drew nigh to the fortifications .
when the gauls were confident that their countrymen were the conquerors in the action , and beheld our men hard pressed by numbers , both those who were hemmed in by the line of circumvallation and those who had come to aid them , supported the spirits of their men by shouts and yells from every quarter .
 corbulo meanwhile entered the province with careful preparation and soon winning a renown of which that campaign was the beginning , he brought his triremes up the channel of the rhine and the rest of his vessels up the estuaries and canals to which they were adapted
 augustus allowed the senate to appoint commissioners
who , when they had conveyed themselves and all their possessions into the town called bratuspantium , and caesar with his army was about five miles distant from that town , all the old men , going out of the town , began to stretch out their hands to caesar , and to intimate by their voice that they would throw themselves on his protection and power , nor would contend in arms against the roman people .
when caesar had arrived at the opening of these forests , and had began to fortify his camp , and no enemy was in the mean time seen , while our men were dispersed on their respective duties , they suddenly rushed out from all parts of the forest , and made an attack on our men .
 those who stood at a distance stretched out their arms , those who were near clasped the emperor's knees , and plotius firmus was the most zealous of them all
 bibulus , as has been observed before , lay with his fleet near oricum , and as he debarred caesar of the liberty of the sea and harbors , so he was deprived of all intercourse with the country by land ; for the whole shore was occupied by parties disposed in different places by caesar . 
 this very conduct provoked afresh these furious men , for fear so excessive seemed to argue a consciousness of guilt
 here he took up a position , and fortified it , and kept all his forces there . 
 meanwhile the enemy moved not till the army began to defile in column through the woods , then made slight skirmishing attacks on its flanks and van , and with his whole force charged the rear
 now , they said , an aged sovereign , whose power had lasted long , who had provided his heirs with abundant means to coerce the state , requires forsooth the defence of soldiers that his burial may be undisturbed
 the centurion seeing that , unarmed as he was , he was very powerful , and more an enraged than a frightened man , ordered his soldiers to overpower him
 the auxiliaries of the ubii and the treveri broke at once in shameful flight , and dispersed over the whole country
 the soldiery of the capital , who were imbued with the spirit of an old allegiance to the caesars , and who had been led to desert nero by intrigues and influences from without rather than by their own feelings , were inclined for change , when they found that the donative promised in galba's name was withheld , and reflected that for great services and great rewards there was not the same room in peace as in war , and that the favour of an emperor created by the legions must be already preoccupied they were further excited by the treason of nymphidius sabinus , their prefect , who himself aimed at the throne
 rhescuporis , hesitating between fear and rage , preferred to be charged with an accomplished rather than with an attempted crime
 meanwhile a powerful host of accusers fell with sudden fury on the class which systematically increased its wealth by usury in defiance of a law passed by caesar the dictator defining the terms of lending money and of holding estates in italy , a law long obsolete because the public good is sacrificed to private interest
 for augustus , when in his last conversations he was discussing who would refuse the highest place , though sufficiently capable , who would aspire to it without being equal to it , and who would unite both the ability and ambition , had described marcus lepidus as able but contemptuously indifferent , gallus asinius as ambitious and incapable , lucius arruntius as not unworthy of it , and , should the chance be given him , sure to make the venture
but this is usually the form of all the gallic walls .
 but she craved the name of wife , for the sake of the monstrous infamy , that last source of delight to the reckless
such was the shortness of the time , and so determined was the mind of the enemy on fighting , that time was wanting not only for affixing the military insignia , but even for putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers from the shields .
when different opinions were expressed , they determined that those who , owing to age or ill health , were unserviceable for war , should depart from the town , and that themselves should try every expedient before they had recourse to the advice of critognatus : however , that they would rather adopt that design , if circumstances should compel them and their allies should delay , than accept any terms of a surrender or peace .
 augustus , did better , seeing that he had aspired
 at this same time the clitae , a tribe subject to the cappadocian archelaus , retreated to the heights of mount taurus , because they were compelled in roman fashion to render an account of their revenue and submit to tribute there they defended themselves by means of the nature of the country against the king's unwarlike troops , till marcus trebellius , whom vitellius , the governor of syria , sent as his lieutenant with four thousand legionaries and some picked auxiliaries , surrounded with his lines two hills occupied by the barbarians , the lesser of which was named cadra , the other davara those who dared to sally out , he reduced to surrender by the sword , the rest by drought
 next the emperor , in a speech , commended all who , from their limited means , voluntarily retired from the senatorian order , while those were degraded from it who , by retaining their seats , added effrontery to poverty
hither all , who have disputes , assemble from every part , and submit to their decrees and determinations .
 next came the prosecution of claudius timarchus of crete , on such charges as often fall on very influential provincials , whom immense wealth has emboldened to the oppression of the weak
 and so , with a solemn appeal , he summoned the senate , as if there were any laws by which silius was being tried , as if varro were a real consul , or rome a commonwealth the accused either said nothing , or , if he attempted to defend himself , hinted , not obscurely , at the person whose resentment was crushing him
 she had grown so frantically enamoured of caius silius , the handsomest of the young nobility of rome , that she drove from his bed junia silana , a high-born lady , and had her lover wholly to herself
 for cerialis , by a judicious temporising , eluded the request as prompted by an idle and childish ambition
 meanwhile civilis , having recruited his army from germany after his defeat among the treveri , took up his position at the old camp , where his situation would protect him , and where the courage of his barbarian troops would be raised by the recollection of successes gained on the spot
 all this happened quite without any providential design
 the first was a freedman ready for any wickedness the latter , as far as speech went , was thoroughly trained in greek learning , but he had not imbued his heart with sound principles
 civilis at first replied in artful language , but soon perceiving that montanus was a man of singularly high spirit and was himself disposed for change , he began with lamenting the perils through which he had struggled for five-and-twenty years in the camps of rome it is , he said , a noble reward that i have received for my toils my brother murdered , myself imprisoned , and the savage clamour of this army , a clamour which demanded my execution , and for which by the law of nations i demand vengeance
all the gauls assert that they are descended from the god dis , and say that this tradition has been handed down by the druids .
 better save the senate which you have adorned to the last the infamy of such an outrage , and leave it a matter of doubt what the senators would have decided , had they seen thrasea on his trial
when this scheme was disclosed to the helvetii by informers , they , according to their custom , compelled orgetorix to plead his cause in chains ; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire should await him if condemned .
caesar , on being informed of these things , cheered the minds of the gauls with his words , and promised that this affair should be an object of his concern , that he had great hopes that ariovistus , induced both by his kindness and his power , would put an end to his oppression .
 after this had passed in the council they broke up full of hopes and joy , and in imagination anticipated victory ; because they thought that in a matter of such importance , no groundless assertion could be made by a general of such experience . 
that about 15 , 000 of them had at first crossed the rhine : but after that these wild and savage men had become enamored of the lands and the refinement and the abundance of the gauls , more were brought over , that there were now as many as 120 , 000 of them in gaul : that with these the aedui and their dependents had repeatedly struggled in arms-that they had been routed , and had sustained a great calamity-had lost all their nobility , all their senate , all their cavalry .
the winter being almost ended , when he was invited by the favorable season of the year to prosecute the war and march against the enemy , whether he could draw them from the marshes and woods , or else press them by a blockade ; some noblemen of the aedui came to him as embassadors to entreat that in an extreme emergency he should succor their state ; that their affairs were in the utmost danger , because , whereas single magistrates had been usually appointed in ancient times and held the power of king for a single year , two persons now exercised this office , and each asserted that he was appointed according to their laws .
 all the rest he left to the mercy or severity of vitellius
 when they entered to plead their cause , a smile of joy on any of the conspirators , a casual conversation , a sudden meeting , or the fact of having entered a banquet or a public show in company , was construed into a crime , while to the savage questionings of nero and tigellinus were added the violent menaces of faenius rufus , who had not yet been named by the informers , but who , to get the credit of complete ignorance , frowned fiercely on his accomplices
 messalina believed that valerius asiaticus , who had been twice consul , was one of poppaea's old lovers at the same time she was looking greedily at the gardens which lucullus had begun and which asiaticus was now adorning with singular magnificence , and so she suborned suilius to accuse both him and poppaea
 ostorius then deployed his light cohorts , but even thus he did not stop the flight , till our legions sustained the brunt of the battle
 no one was to fight without orders
 trebonius began to provide and repair what had been destroyed , with much greater zeal on the part of the soldiers ; for when they saw that their extraordinary pains and preparations had an unfortunate issue , they were fired with indignation that , in consequence of the impious violation of the truce , their valor should be held in derision . 
 but he did it that he might have several safeguards to rest on he had no war at the time on his hands except against the germans , which was rather to wipe out the disgrace of the loss of quintilius varus and his army than out of an ambition to extend the empire , or for any adequate recompense
 for what others call crimes he calls reforms , and , by similar misnomers , he speaks of strictness instead of barbarity , of economy instead of avarice , while the cruelties and affronts inflicted upon you he calls discipline
learn this intelligence from those who have escaped from the massacre ; for i , since my brothers and all my relations have been slain , am prevented by grief from declaring what has taken place .
 who will endure those huge volumes , on a legal plea or form , which we have read in the speeches for marcus tullius and aulus caecina
 indeed there was no one who was more frequently the object of all kinds of outbreaks than verginius
having quickly finished the work and led his legions across , he selected a fit place for a camp , and recalled the rest of his troops .
 cneius , pompey's son , who commanded the egyptian fleet , having got intelligence of these things , came to oricum , and weighed up the ship , that had been sunk , with a windlass , and by straining at it with several ropes , and attacked the other which had been placed by acilius to watch the port with several ships , on which he had raised very high turrets , so that fighting as it were from an eminence , and sending fresh men constantly to relieve the fatigued , and at the same time attempting the town on all sides by land , with ladders and his fleet , in order to divide the force of his enemies , he overpowered our men by fatigue , and the immense number of darts , and took the ship , having beat off the men that were put on board to defend it , who , however , made their escape in small boats ; and at the , same time he seized a natural mole on the opposite side , which almost formed an island over against the town . 
 that all these events were unknown to the other legions , and were not told to their emperor , though the sudden outburst of treason might have been crushed by the prompt action of so many provinces
 hastily fitting out a fleet of liburnian ships he pursued anicetus , and overtook him at the mouth of the river cohibus , where he was protected by the king of the sedochezi , whose alliance he had secured by a sum of money and other presents
 as soon as they fell on it , they slid off again , and were removed from its side by long poles and forks . 
 so narcissus replied that the emperor would hear her , and that she should have an opportunity of disproving the charge
 sorties were continually made
 syria was to be assigned to publius anteius , but he was soon put off by various artifices and finally detained at rome
 weigh thoroughly with yourself beforehand , at such a crisis as this , the path of political life on which you enter
 everything was under the freedman's control
 some of the soldiers killed themselves near the funeral pile , not moved by remorse or by fear , but by the desire to emulate his glory , and by love of their prince
 would justice be promoted , or would they serve on the knights' commissions for the honourable office of a judge , because they had listened with critical sagacity to effeminate strains of music and sweet voices
 our soldiers , on the other hand , with their shields pressed to their breasts , and their hands grasping their sword-hilts , struck at the huge limbs and exposed faces of the barbarians , cutting a passage through the slaughtered enemy , for arminius was now less active , either from incessant perils , or because he was partially disabled by his recent wound
he therefore sends titus labienus , his legate , with the cavalry to the treveri , who are nearest to the river rhine .
 yet it was generally said , that in secret conversations with nero he had calumniated corbulo's high qualities
volusenus , who had been sent with the cavalry , arrived that night , he could not gain credence that caesar was close at hand with his army safe .
 the legions were ordered to arm themselves , signals were made over the country that every man should leave plundering , and join the battle at the nearest point
 persons were not wanting to report all this to seneca , in the exact words , or with a worse sense put on it
husbands have power of life and death over their wives as well as over their children : and when the father of a family , born in a more than commonly distinguished rank , has died , his relations assemble , and , if the circumstances of his death are suspicious , hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves ; and , if proof be obtained , put them to severe torture , and kill them .
 asinius pollio's writings too hand down a glorious memory of them , and messala corvinus used to speak with pride of cassius as his general
the legions being distributed in this manner , he thought he could most easily remedy the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarters of all these legions were comprehended within 100 miles .
 the superintendence of the corn supply was given to faenius rufus , the direction of the games which the emperor was preparing , to arruntius stella , and the province of egypt to caius balbillus
 they next fell on t vinius and in his case also it is not known whether the fear of instant death choked his utterance , or whether he cried out that otho had not given orders to slay him
accordingly , the speech of indutiomarus , which he had delivered in the council , having been made known by cingetorix and his allies , he sends messengers to the neighboring states and summons horse from all quarters : he appoints to them a fixed day for assembling .
 truth too would be more easily distinguished from perverse misrepresentation by a single judge , where a number would be swayed by hatred and ill-will
 caesar having set out with one legion to gain possession of the more remote states , and to provide corn , of which he had but a small quantity , was at this time at buthrotum , opposite to corcyra . 
 he was ordered to impeach marcus silanus , and because he refused was put to death
after having routed these in several battles , he arrives in the territories of the vocontii in the further province on the seventh day from ocelum , which is the most remote town of the hither province ; thence he leads his army into the country of the allobroges , and from the allobroges to the segusiani .
 then , again , the ceremony itself had its difficulties , which were purposely avoided and there was the objection that the man who obtained this priesthood was emancipated from the father's authority , as also was his wife , as passing into the husband's control
 then agrippina , changing her tactics , plied the lad with various blandishments , and even offered the seclusion of her chamber for the concealment of indulgences which youth and the highest rank might claim
 the assailants were not armed with anything but swords , and it seemed too tedious to send for machines and missiles
 hence there was all the more joy at the recoil of these precedents on their authors
 arminius and inguiomerus fled from the battle , the first unhurt , the other severely wounded their followers were slaughtered , as long as our fury and the light of day lasted
 he then fortified suitable positions , and at the same time beheaded some chiefs of the musulamii , who were on the verge of rebellion
these had a dispute with each other for precedence , and in the struggle between the magistrates they had contended with their utmost efforts , the one for convictolitanis , the other for cotus .
together with other causes , this consideration also led them to that resolution , viz : that they had learned that diviciacus and the aedui were approaching the territories of the bellovaci .
 the god himself , because he heals the sick , many identified with aesculapius
 the savage temper of drusus , to say nothing of lust of power and the usual feuds between brothers , was inflamed with envy by the partiality of the mother agrippina towards nero
 next came as many other legions , and light-armed troops with horse-bowmen , and the remaining cohorts of the allies
 cerialis sent no answer to civilis and classicus , but despatched the bearer and the letter itself to domitian
 but his chief glory rested on the wonderful tact with which as city-prefect he handled an authority , recently made perpetual and all the more galling to men unaccustomed to obey it
 after them to the usipii
 for they did write poems , and sent them to libraries , with no better success than cicero , but with better luck , because fewer people know that they wrote them
 civilis attempted nothing more , and retired to the other side of the rhine
 julianus , having discovered his danger , and procured some guides , who were acquainted with the country , fled through the pathless wastes of moesia beyond mount haemus , nor did he afterwards take any part in the civil war
 neither did urgulania obey the summons , for in defiance of piso she went in her litter to the emperor's house
 then in headlong flight he hurried to iberia , his ancestral kingdom
basilus does as he was commanded ; having performed his march rapidly , and even surpassed the expectations of all , he surprises in the fields many not expecting him ; through their information he advances toward ambiorix himself , to the place in which he was said to be with a few horse .
 in this debate it was better that my eyes should not be on you , for while you were noting the anxious faces of individual senators charged with shameful luxury , i too myself might observe them and , as it were , detect them
in many states you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated spots ; nor does it often happen that any one , disregarding the sanctity of the case , dares either to secrete in his house things captured , or take away those deposited ; and the most severe punishment , with torture , has been established for such a deed .
 for myself , though i am perhaps able to accomplish and effect something in pleading causes , yet it was by the public reading of tragedies that i first began to enter the path of fame , when in nero's time i broke the wicked power of vatinius by which even the sanctities of culture were profaned , and if at this moment i possess any celebrity and distinction i maintain that it has been acquired more by the renown of my poems than of my speeches
 the former as an accomplice of nymphidius , the latter as one of nero's generals
 besides , even economy had been consulted , when a permanent edifice was erected for a theatre , in preference to a structure raised and fitted up yearly at vast expense
 the augustal game's which were then inaugurated , were disturbed by quarrels arising out of rivalry between the actors
 octavia , however , was dismissed under the form of an ordinary divorce , and received possession of the house of burrus and of the estates of plautus , an ill-starred gift
 in a moment they flew to arms he arrayed his eager and impetuous troops in such a manner that the auxiliary infantry , 8 , 000 in number , strengthened his centre , while 3 , 000 cavalry were posted on his wings
 they are wont also to dig out subterranean caves , and pile on them great heaps of dung , as a shelter from winter and as a receptacle for the year's produce , for by such places they mitigate the rigour of the cold and should an enemy approach , he lays waste the open country , while what is hidden and buried is either not known to exist , or else escapes him from the very fact that it has to be searched for
 on the subsequent arrival of two legions , the third commanded by dillius aponianus , the eighth by numisius lupus , it was resolved to make a demonstration of their strength , and to surround verona with military lines
 and meanwhile ostorius sabinus , the accuser of soranus , entered , and began by speaking of his friendship with rubellius plautus and of his proconsulate in asia which he had , he said , adapted to his own glory rather than to the public welfare , by fostering seditious movements in the various states
 credit was thus restored , and gradually private lenders were found
 the line was supported , as it began to waver , by antonius , who brought up the praetorians
 a few concessions are made to the wants of women , but such as are not even a burden to their husbands homes , much less to the allies
 caesar was more desirous that they should be humbled by these means , and forced to come to terms , than decide the contest by battle . 
 some of the rowers were batavians , and they hindered the operations of the sailors and combatants by an apparent want of skill
 vibullius , having received this commission from caesar , thought it no less necessary to give pompey notice of caesar's sudden approach , that he might adopt such plans as the circumstance required , than to inform him of caesar's message ; and therefore continuing his journey by night as well as by day , and taking fresh horses for dispatch , he posted away to pompey , to inform him that caesar was marching toward him with all his forces . 
 and then too the emperor listened with an angry frown to his defence , which cremutius , resolved to give up his life , began thus 
 he remitted the tax which the roman citizens had promised to varro for the public use : he restored their goods to those who he was informed had incurred that penalty by speaking too freely , having given public and private rewards to some he filled the rest with flattering hopes of his future intentions ; and having staid two days at corduba , he set out for gades ; he ordered the money and ornaments which had been carried away from the temple of hercules , and lodged in the houses of private persons , to be replaced in the temple . 
 a single king once ruled us now two are set over us a legate to tyrannise over our lives , a procurator to tyrannise over our property
 it was to no purpose that he had driven into obscurity the pursuit of forensic eloquence and the graceful accomplishments of civil life , if another were to forestall the distinctions of war
caesar perceived that by this speech of liscus , dumnorix , the brother of diviciacus , was indicated ; but , as he was unwilling that these matters should be discussed while so many were present , he speedily dismisses the council , but detains liscus : he inquires from him when alone , about those things which he had said in the meeting .
 however he adhered to his former purpose respecting his cavalry , for as he was by many degrees inferior in number , he selected the youngest and most active of the advanced guard , and desired them to fight intermixed with the horse , and they by constant practice acquired experience in this kind of battle . 
 in our transmarine provinces the conveyance of corn was rendered less costly , and it was decided that merchant ships should not be assessed with their owner's property , and that no tax should be paid on them
embassadors also are sent to those states of hither spain which are nearest to aquitania , and auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them ; on whose arrival they proceed to carry on the war with great confidence , and with a great host of men .
 the enemy fled with trifling loss , as the day was on the decline
 and amid so many evils i look forward to death as the end of my sufferings
 who were the original inhabitants of britain , whether they were indigenous or foreign , is , as usual among barbarians , little known
 these he covered over with earth and mold , that he might not be prevented from access to them to defend them , and in the front and on both sides he protected them with a parapet of wicker work ; and on every fourth one raised a turret , two stories high , to secure them the better from being attacked by the shipping and set on fire . 
ariovistus had two wives , one a suevan by nation , whom he brought with him from home ; the other a norican , the sister of king vocion , whom he had married in gaul , she having been sent by her brother .
fabius , without delaying a moment , meets him on the march with his legion , as he had been commanded .
 about midday there was a skirmishing attack on our camp , without any discharge of missiles , when they saw the cohorts in close array before the lines and no sign of carelessness
the segui and condrusi , of the nation and number of the germans , and who are between the eburones and the treviri , sent embassadors to caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies , nor consider that the cause of all the germans on this side the rhine was one and the same ; that they had formed no plans of war , and had sent no auxiliaries to ambiorix .
 staggering in their blood on the slippery marsh , they shook off their riders , driving hither and thither all in their way , and trampling on the fallen
 others may have held the throne for a longer time , but no one can have left it with such fortitude
 the latter was saved by the distinguished services of his uncle
 their approach put an end to the battle , and each general led back his legions to their respective camps . 
 he had also exacted from the tax-gatherers , two years' rents that they owed ; and enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year , and demanded a supply of horse from the whole province . 
 at length , beset on all sides , their cattle having been four days without fodder , and having no water , wood , or corn , they beg a conference ; and that , if possible , in a place remote from the soldiers . 
 after the conclusion of the war , caesar was informed of these expressions by some persons who were present at the conversation . 
 they even say that an altar dedicated to ulysses , with the addition of the name of his father , laertes , was formerly discovered on this same spot , and that certain monuments and tombs , with greek inscriptions , still exist on the borders of germany and rhætia
 then he extolled the valour of vespasian , and the strength of his party
all march to alesia , sanguine and full of confidence : nor was there a single individual who imagined that the romans could withstand the sight of such an immense host : especially in an action carried on both in front and rear , when the besieged would sally from the town and attack the enemy , and on the outside so great forces of cavalry and infantry would be seen .
 to these forces were added the elite of the marines of the ravenna fleet , who demanded permission to serve in the legions
 after a while , as is the way with great terrors , they thought what happened the worst alternative
 within a few days , in quick succession , annaeus mela , cerialis anicius , rufius crispinus , and petronius fell , mela and crispinus being roman knights with senatorian rank
 agricola , fearing that from the enemy's superiority of force he would be simultaneously attacked in front and on the flanks , widened his ranks , and though his line was likely to be too extended , and several officers advised him to bring up the legions , yet , so sanguine was he , so resolute in meeting danger , he sent away his horse and took his stand on foot before the colours
 there is no privilege , no exclusion from worthy emperors you derive equal advantage , though you dwell so far away , while cruel rulers are most formidable to their neighbours
 still the legionaries , though their position was alarming , kept their arms and their ranks
 afranius , as above mentioned , had three legions , petreius two there were besides about eighty cohorts raised in hither and further spain of which , the troops belonging to the former province had shields , those of the latter targets , and about five thousand horse raised in both provinces . 
 go , he exclaimed , follow the roman birds , the true deities of our legions
 about this time , decimus laelius arrived with his fleet at brundusium and in the same manner , as libo had done before , possessed himself of an island opposite the harbor of brundusium . 
 therefore in the general consternation , every man consulted his own safety . 
 then the roman commended the young prince for abandoning rash courses , and adopting a safe and expedient policy
 this incident , not mentioned by any historian , i have found in the memoirs of the younger agrippina , the mother of the emperor nero , who handed down to posterity the story of her life and of the misfortunes of her family
 as for the present money-getting and blood-stained eloquence , its use is modern , its origin in corrupt manners , and , as you said , aper , it is a device to serve as a weapon
 this neglect of archelaus was not due to pride , but was suggested by the intimate friends of augustus , because , when caius caesar was in his prime and had charge of the affairs of the east , tiberius's friendship was thought to be dangerous
this request having been granted , they appointed a day for the assembly , and ordained by an oath with each other , that no one should disclose except those to whom this should be assigned by the general assembly .
 now too italy was prostrated by disasters either entirely novel , or that recurred only after a long succession of ages
 during the same time there was a discussion in the senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class , and a strong demand was made that , as a check on the undeserving , patrons should have the right of revoking freedom
 the language differs but little there is the same boldness in challenging danger , and , when it is near , the same timidity in shrinking from it
 and from this they take their name among their countrymen , so that what was originally a mere number has now become a title of distinction
 his ostensible motive however was solicitude for the province he reduced the price of corn by opening the granaries , and adopted many practices pleasing to the multitude
this state is by far the most powerful of all gaul in cavalry , and has great forces of infantry , and as we have remarked above , borders on the rhine .
 several months had now elapsed , and winter was almost gone , and caesar's legions and shipping were not coming to him from brundusium , and he imagined that some opportunities had been neglected , for the winds had at least been often favorable , and he thought that he must trust to them at last . 
 the conflict commenced without delay , the enemy's line of battle being so arranged , that part of the levies from the fleet , who had a number of rustics among their ranks , were posted on the slope of the hills which border on the coast , the praetorians fully occupying the level ground between the hills and the shore , while on the sea was the fleet , moored to the land and ready for action , drawn up in line so as to present a formidable front
 octavius had seduced one pontia postumia , and , on her refusing to marry him , in the frenzy of passion had murdered her sosianus by his depravity had brought many to ruin
 the report was daily gaining credit when an accident put an end to it
 and now the enemy , as prompted by their various dispositions , fled in whole battalions with arms in their hands before a few pursuers , while some , who were unarmed , actually rushed to the front and gave themselves up to death
 neither was pompey willing to leave the sea and dyrrachium , because he had lodged his material there , his weapons , arms , and engines ; and supplied his army with corn from it by his ships ; nor was he able to put a stop to caesar's works without hazarding a battle , which at that time he had determined not to do . 
 what will happen if the rivalry is rendered more intense by such a marriage
 the blaze in its fury ran first through the level portions of the city , then rising to the hills , while it again devastated every place below them , it outstripped all preventive measures so rapid was the mischief and so completely at its mercy the city , with those narrow winding passages and irregular streets , which characterised old rome
 but he never left italy for eighteen years , living to old age and losing much of his renown through an excessive clinging to life
 thousands were put to the sword , thousands more were sold into slavery
yet , though assailed by so many disadvantages , having received many wounds , they withstood the enemy , and , a great portion of the day being spent , though they fought from day-break till the eighth hour , they did nothing which was unworthy of them .
 valens and caecina were present , and pointed out the various localities of the field of battle
caesar , having ascertained this fact by an examination of his prisoners , commanded that if any of the eburones in their flight had repaired to them , they should be sent back to him ; he assures them that if they did that , he will not injure their territories .
he witnesses with surprise the towers , mantelets , and fortifications belonging to the enemy : the legion having been drawn out , he finds that even every tenth soldier had not escaped without wounds .
 once when they met , nero greeted britannicus by that name and was greeted in return as domitius
 the jews formed their line close under their walls , whence , if successful , they might venture to advance , and where , if repulsed , they had a refuge at hand
 the lad grew up to manhood , and was enrolled by galba in the 7th legion now chancing to meet his father , he brought him to the ground with a wound , and , as he rifled his dying foe , recognized him , and was himself recognized clasping the expiring man in his arms , in piteous accents he implored the spirit of his father to be propitious to him , and not to turn from him with loathing as from a parricide
 the 14th were styled the conquerors of britain
 without a moment's delay tiberius went to the house and inspected the chamber , where were seen the marks of her struggling and of her forcible ejection
 the tribes of the suevi and the sarmatae rose in concert against us
 claudius at the same time broke off the connection silanus was forced to resign his office , and the one remaining day of his praetorship was conferred on eprius marcellus
when his men attempted to aid him , in vain , he says , you endeavor to procure me safety , since blood and strength are now failing me , therefore leave this , while you have the opportunity , and retreat to the legion .
as each first came he stood beneath the wall , and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in action .
 this was more pleasant than safe , for to be peaceful is self-deception among lawless and powerful neighbours
 in the middle of the river was an island while the gladiators were making their way to it in boats , the germans swam and outstripped them
 and so it is not ability , it is only memory and recollection which i require i have to repeat now , with the same divisions and arguments , following closely the course of that discussion , those subtle reflections which i heard , powerfully expressed , from men of the highest eminence , each of whom assigned a different but plausible reason , thereby displaying the peculiarities of his individual temper and genius
 he limited the fee which might be taken to ten thousand sesterces , and those who exceeded this limit were to be liable to the penalties of extortion
 , if all poor men begin to come here and to beg money for their children , individuals will never be satisfied , and the state will be bankrupt
caesar , immediately learning this through his scouts , fearing an ambuscade , because he had not yet discovered for what reason they were departing , kept his army and cavalry within the camp .
 next were to be seen his brothers , his wife and daughter
 meanwhile a rumour had spread that our army was cut off , and that a furious german host was marching on gaul and had not agrippina prevented the bridge over the rhine from being destroyed , some in their cowardice would have dared that base act
 if leniently regarded , pitiable but there was one paper in libo's handwriting , so the prosecutor alleged , with the names of caesars and of senators , to which marks were affixed of dreadful or mysterious significance
 now , however , the furthest limits of britain are thrown open , and the unknown always passes for the marvellous
 thus the camp was taken and plundered
 they who had gone out to get forage or corn , were chased by the light troops of the lusitanians , and the targeteers of hither spain , who were well acquainted with the country , and could readily swim across the river , because it is the custom of all those people not to join their armies without bladders . 
 his camp was well adapted for protracting a war , from the nature and strength of the situation , from its proximity to the sea , and the abundance of water and salt , of which a great quantity had been stored up from the neighboring salt-pits . 
 the camp was bravely defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard it , but with much more spirit by the thracians and foreign auxiliaries . 
thus neither husbandry , nor the art and practice of war are neglected .
 this was anicetus , a freedman of polemon , once a very powerful personage , who , when the kingdom was converted into a roman province , ill brooked the change
 no rank was free from apprehension or peril
 at rome meanwhile people said that it was not only the treveri and aedui who had revolted , but sixty-four states of gaul with the germans in alliance , while spain too was disaffected anything in fact was believed , with rumour's usual exaggeration
wherefore , having provided corn , procured auxiliaries and cavalry , having summoned by name many valiant men from tolosa , carcaso , and narbo , which are the states of the province of gaul , that border on these regions , he led his army into the territories of the sotiates .
 the senate and leading citizens were in doubt whether to regard him as more terrible at a distance or among them
the horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in a skirmish with our cavalry on the march ; yet so that our men were conquerors in all parts , and drove them to their woods and hills ; but , having slain a great many , they pursued too eagerly , and lost some of their men .
 thence he directed his course to euboea and crossed to lesbos , where agrippina for the last time was confined and gave birth to julia
 formerly , it was not only a praetor or a consul , but private persons also , who were sent to inspect the provinces , and to report what they thought about each man's loyalty and nations were timidly sensitive to the opinion of individuals
 this fired their courage , and at a single dash they broke through the enemy , and drove him back with great slaughter into the open country
 whether hercules really visited the country , or whether we have agreed to ascribe every work of grandeur , wherever met with , to his renown
 though he had thus quietly divided the conquered party , there arose a disturbance among the conquerors
allured by booty , they advance further ; neither morass nor forest obstructs these men , born amid war and depredations ; they inquire of their prisoners in what part caesar is ; they find that he has advanced further , and learn that all the army has removed .
 it was decreed without hesitation , and the condemned man was dragged off , exclaiming as loudly as he could , with head covered and throat tightly bound , that this was inaugurating the year
 the wind being favorable , he sent into the port about forty ships provided with combustibles , and the flame catching on both sides , five ships were burned to ashes . 
 he had fled from britain because of the exasperation of the soldiery
 he then enriched his most powerful friends with liberal presents
 public-spirited munificence was still in fashion , and augustus had not hindered taurus , philippus , or balbus from applying the spoils of war or their superfluous wealth to adorn the capital and to win the admiration of posterity
 we have no quarrel with the romans , for whom we have so often fought
 after having made these complaints in a public assembly , he fled from his province . 
 but his soldiers insisted on battle , exclaiming that valour could overcome all things
 which as soon as caesar perceived , being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat , but to be repulsed , and that greater loss might be sustained , when his men were almost half way down the hill , he encouraged them by antonius , who commanded that legion , ordered the signal of battle to be sounded , and a charge to be made on the enemy . 
 to some of his slaves he gave liberal presents , a flogging to others
 the romans thwart me , and though they have never with success to themselves disturbed the peace between us , they are now again breaking it to their own destruction
 fufius was indeed a man well fitted to win the affection of a woman he was witty too , and accustomed to ridicule tiberius with those bitter jests which the powerful remember so long
but so great was the courage of our soldiers , and such their presence of mind , that though they were scorched on all sides , and harassed by a vast number of weapons , and were aware that their baggage and their possessions were burning , not only did no one quit the rampart for the purpose of withdrawing from the scene , but scarcely did any one even then look behind ; and they all fought most vigorously and most valiantly .
 nor did this first opinion deceive him . 
 he was a centurion in a cohort of the praetorian guard , and had been appointed by galba to escort piso rushing , dagger in hand , to meet the armed men , and upbraiding them with their crime , he drew the attention of the murderers on himself by his exclamations and gestures , and thus gave piso , wounded as he was , an opportunity of escape
 worn out by the labour , and knowing that similar hardships were endured in several provinces , the soldiers wrote a secret despatch in the name of the armies , begging the emperor to give in advance triumphal distinctions to one to whom he was about to entrust his forces
 as nature has given light and air to all men , so has she thrown open every land to the brave
caesar , fearing to pursue them very far , because woods and morasses intervened , and also he saw that they suffered no small loss in abandoning their position , reaches cicero the same day with all his forces safe .
 the general , although he was overcome by the despair of his army , first wrote a letter to vologeses , not a suppliant petition , but in a tone of remonstrance against the doing of hostile acts on behalf of the armenians , who always had been under roman dominion , or subject to a king chosen by the emperor
 as the wishes and opinions of all were changed by this act , curio , with the general consent , determined , whenever opportunity offered , to hazard a battle . 
 one of the copies of his will was conveyed to rome by his embassadors to be deposited in the treasury , but the public troubles preventing it , it was lodged with pompey : another was left sealed up , and kept at alexandria . 
 still , if any decree of the senate was marked by some new flattery , or by the lowest servility , i shall not pass it over in silence
 sariolenus indeed laboured under an imputation of recent date
 men will soon come to put you also in chains and inflict on you an ignominious death
 nor did he stop there , but with the same dispatch , collecting a few of his flying troops , and halting neither day nor night , he arrived at the seaside , attended by only thirty horse , and went on board a victualing barque , often complaining , as we have been told , that he had been so deceived in his expectation , that he was almost persuaded that he had been betrayed by those from whom he had expected victory , as they began the fight . 
caesar , having delayed two days in that place , because he had anticipated that , in the natural course of events , such would be the conduct of vercingetorix , leaves the army under pretense of raising recruits and cavalry : he places brutus , a young man , in command of these forces ; he gives him instructions that the cavalry should range as extensively as possible in all directions ; that he would exert himself not to be absent from the camp longer than three days .
 many of these men were attached to the secret councils of poppaea and were the vilest tools in the employ of the imperial household one of them , ptolemaeus , had attended otho in spain , and had there foretold that his patron would survive nero
 that speeches in a new style and new resolutions were being heard and read
 and yet after each there arose another ruler yet more detestable and more cruel
 they would neither receive caesar's commissioners , nor guarantee their safety , but referred the whole to pompey . 
 it is for the needs and the business of life that the resource of eloquence is acquired , thanks to which no one for want of an advocate is at the mercy of the powerful
 elsewhere ocean girds it , embracing broad peninsulas and islands of unexplored extent , where certain tribes and kingdoms are newly known to us , revealed by war
 to valens were entrusted the picked troops of the army of lower germany with the eagle of the 5th legion and the auxiliary infantry and cavalry , to the number of 40 , 000 armed men
 we have the wealth of the state and of private individuals we have a vast supply of money , which in a civil war is a mightier weapon than the sword our soldiers are inured to the climate of italy or to yet greater heat
 the soldiers themselves , who knew the country well , marked out rich estates and wealthy owners for plunder , or for death in case of resistance their commanders were in their power and dared not check them
 in an open plain between the padus and the road , two legions happened to meet on the side of vitellius was the 21st , called the rapax , a corps of old and distinguished renown on that of otho was the 1st , called adjutrix , which had never before been brought into the field , but was high-spirited , and eager to gain its first triumph
 by these and many similar arguments they so wrought upon the troops , that even the legates and the leaders of the party did not think it possible to check their fury but the people of vienna , aware of their danger , assumed the veils and chaplets of suppliants , and , as the army approached , clasped the weapons , knees and feet of the soldiers , and so turned them from their purpose
a hope having been presented them , the germans leave in concealment the plunder they had acquired ; they themselves hasten to aduatuca , employing as their guide the same man by whose information they had become informed of these things .
 the minds of the soldiery were already on fire , when maevius pudens , a near relative of tigellinus , added , so to speak , fuel to the flames
 he also turned the licence of the games and the enthusiasm for the actors into something like a battle by the impunity he allowed , and the rewards he offered , and especially by looking on himself , sometimes concealed , but often in public view , till , with the people at strife and the fear of a worse commotion , the only remedy which could be devised was the expulsion of the offending actors from italy , and the presence once more of the soldiery in the theatre
 was it the only worthy object of reform to provide that the syracusans should not give shows on a larger scale
 caesar , having received an account of this , and relying on the affections of the municipal towns , drafted all the cohorts of the thirteenth legion from the garrison , and set out for auximum , a town into which attius had brought his cohorts , and of which he had taken possession , and from which he had sent senators round about the country of picenum , to raise new levies . 
the earth , heaped up by all against the fortifications , gives the means of ascent to the gauls , and covers those works which the romans had concealed in the ground .
 thus the intended plans of tiridates were wholly reversed , and he sent envoys to ask on behalf of himself and of the parthians , why , when hostages had lately been given and a friendship renewed which might open up a way to further acts of good will , he was thus driven from armenia , his ancient possession
what issue would the advice of cotta and of those who differed from him , have ? from which , if immediate danger was not to be dreaded , yet certainly famine , by a protracted siege , was .
 it was in fact the rearguard of the army , and their recognition removed the cause of alarm
 when , however , the choice was presented to him between war and the profit to be derived from treachery , he consented , with the characteristic perfidy of barbarians , to the destruction of anicetus , and delivered up the refugees
 after this , alfenius varus , prefect of the camp , seeing that the mutiny was gradually subsiding , promoted the reaction by the following device he forbade the centurions to visit the sentinels , and discontinued the trumpet calls by which the troops are summoned to their usual military duties
 they quail under disaster , just as in success they forget alike divine and human laws
 yet even thus the camp might have been held , and the parthian foe baffled , by protracting the war , had paetus stood firm either by his own counsels or by those of others
 night was coming on with a fierce storm , and the foe , one moment with a tumultuous uproar , another in awful silence , had perplexed the besiegers , when sabinus went round the camp , entreating the men not to give a chance to their stealthy assailants by heeding embarrassing noises or being deceived by quiet , but to keep , every one , to his post without moving or discharging their darts on false alarms
 then , when the blood has flowed into the extremities , they let it escape by a slight puncture and suck it in turn
 next , he extolled the unity of italy , the loyalty of gaul , the entire absence of turbulence or strife
 but germans , by routing or making prisoners of carbo , cassius , scaurus aurelius , servilius cæpio , and marcus manlius , deprived the roman people of five consular armies , and they robbed even a cæsar of varus and his three legions not without loss to us were they discomfited by marius in italy , by the great julius in gaul , and by drusus , nero , and germanicus , on their own ground
caesar was now reported to have departed from gergovia ; intelligence was likewise brought to them concerning the revolt of the aedui , and a successful rising in gaul ; and that caesar , having been prevented from prosecuting his journey and crossing the loire , and having been compelled by the want of corn , had marched hastily to the province .
 and without the consent of those who are masters of the pharos , no vessels can enter the harbor , on account of its narrowness . 
 as they would not endure his rigour , the charge of the affair was at his own request transferred to the brothers scribonii , to whom was given a praetorian cohort , the terror of which , coupled with the execution of a few persons , restored peace to the townspeople
thither , immediately after midnight , caesar , using as guides the same persons who had come to him as messengers from iccius , sends some numidian and cretan archers , and some balearian slingers as a relief to the towns-people , by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with the hope of defense , was infused into the remi , and , for the same reason , the hope of gaining the town , abandoned the enemy .
 and as men desired nothing against morality , they were debarred from nothing by fear
 we must invade italy , we must seize the capital
 although a certain carenes pressed them to come and promised easy success if they hastened their arrival , they did not make for mesopotamia , which was close to them , but , by a long detour , for armenia , then ill-suited to their movements , as winter was beginning
 meanwhile cetrius severus , subrius dexter , and pompeius longinus , all three military tribunes , proceeded to the praetorian camp , in the hope that a sedition , which was but just commencing , and not yet fully matured , might be swayed by better counsels
 they had not indeed any discrimination or sincerity , for on that same day they would raise with equal zeal a wholly different cry it was their traditional custom to flatter any ruler with reckless applause and meaningless zeal
 germanicus meantime , though he had concentrated his army and prepared vengeance against the mutineers , thought that he ought still to allow them an interval , in case they might , with the late warning before them , regard their safety he sent a despatch to caecina , which said that he was on the way with a strong force , and that , unless they forestalled his arrival by the execution of the guilty , he would resort to an indiscriminate massacre
 next day the murder was notorious , and there was no question as to the murderer , for it was proved that he had passed some time with her
he himself , on the assizes of hither gaul being concluded , proceeds into illyricum , because he heard that the part of the province nearest them was being laid waste by the incursions of the pirustae .
 cerialis , more in astonishment than alarm , drew up his fleet in line , and , though inferior in numbers , it had the advantage in the experience of the crews , the skill of the pilots , and the size of the vessels
 some indeed there were whom all this moved to thoughts of the mutability of fortune , to pity , and to tears
 a noble example of manhood was on that day witnessed by our age in sempronius densus
 still larger was the number of camp-followers and of all slaves , the slaves of soldiers are the most unruly
 the fleet appointed cornelius fuscus to be prefect , and he hastened to join them
 this nero examined , and ordered it to be conveyed to mela , whose wealth he ravenously desired
 but he scarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to transport fifteen thousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse . 
 the troops were kindly received , and they vied with each other in good behaviour this happy state of things , however , was of short duration owing to the violence of the auxiliary infantry , which had detached itself , as before related , from the 14th legion , and had been incorporated by valens with his army
the trinobantes being protected and secured from any violence of the soldiers , the cenimagni , the segontiaci , the ancalites , the bibroci , and the cassi , sending embassies , surrendered themselves to caesar .
 even if we had now for the first time to come to a decision , do you believe that a slave took courage to murder his master without letting fall a threatening word or uttering a rash syllable
 from this place the troops descended to what was more a massacre than a conflict
 theirs were prayers indeed , but such as it was impossible to reject they were therefore received into the praetorian camp
 corsica , however , all but suffered fatal injury from the rash proceedings of decumus pacarius , the procurator , proceedings which in so gigantic a war could contribute nothing to the general result , and which only brought destruction upon their author
 thus it was , as tradition says , that the mothers of the gracchi , of cæsar , of augustus , cornelia , aurelia , atia , directed their children's education and reared the greatest of sons
 no indolence or riot disgraced his march he wore a cuirass of iron , and was to be seen in front of the standards , on foot , rough and negligent in dress , and utterly unlike what common report had pictured him
 when caesar arrived in asia , he found that titus ampius had attempted to remove the money from the temple of diana at ephesus ; and for this purpose had convened all the senators in the province that he might have them to attest the sum , but was interrupted by caesar's arrival , and had made his escape . 
 britain was thoroughly subdued and immediately abandoned
 he backed up his words by an air of resolution turning on his accuser , he denounced him as an infamous and depraved wretch , with so fearless a voice and look that the information was beginning to collapse , when milichus was reminded by his wife that antonious natalis had had a long secret conversation with scaevinus , and that both were piso's intimate friends
 nothing else at the time was the subject of the credulous gossip of the people , and of the very different conversation of thinking persons
affairs were then in that position that the aedui were considered by far the leading people , and the remi held the second post of honor .
 he at the same time borrowed money from the tribunes and centurions , which he distributed among his soldiers . 
 its governor was at this time tiberius alexander , a native of the country
 marius celsus had his consulship confirmed to him
 then came the cyprians on behalf of three shrines , the oldest of which had been set up by their founder aerias to the paphian venus , the second by his son amathus to venus of amathus , and the last to jupiter of salamis , by teucer when he fled from the wrath of his father telamon
 he would go to rome , and bring the emperor a new glory , a suppliant arsacid , while parthia was prosperous
 thus , while they fight singly , all are conquered
 about the same time plautius silvanus , the praetor , for unknown reasons , threw his wife apronia out of a window when summoned before the emperor by lucius apronius , his father-in-law , he replied incoherently , representing that he was in a sound sleep and consequently knew nothing , and that his wife had chosen to destroy herself
 he would suffer prosecutions , perils , anything indeed rather than make an old and self-learned position of honour to bow before an upstart prosperity
since the latter were less powerful by themselves , inasmuch as the chief influence was from of old among the aedui , and their dependencies were great , they had united to themselves the germans and ariovistus , and had brought them over to their party by great sacrifices and promises .
 the army then marched against the silures , a naturally fierce people and now full of confidence in the might of caractacus , who by many an indecisive and many a successful battle had raised himself far above all the other generals of the britons
 a cloud of dust and the glitter of arms were seen at a distance
 and doubtless he had preserved her life , not indeed out of mercy , when he had murdered so many , but to secure for himself a refuge for the future for all the greatest villains , distrusting the present , and dreading change , look for private friendship to shelter them from public detestation , caring not to be free from guilt , but only to ensure their turn in impunity
 he prevailed too on some well-known roman knights , by immense presents , to offer their services in the amphitheatre only pay from one who is able to command , carries with it the force of compulsion
 more , however , eluded discovery , escaping either through the faithful protection of friends or by their own tact
 wonderful was the contrast between the army and the emperor
 each , at his summons , stated his name , his rank , his birthplace , the number of his campaigns , what brave deeds he had done in battle , his military rewards , if any
while lucius domitius and appius claudius were consuls , caesar , when departing from his winter quarters into italy , as he had been accustomed to do yearly , commands the legates whom he appointed over the legions to take care that during the winter as many ships as possible should be built , and the old repaired .
 to these words , which roused the two armies , was added the stimulus of special motives of their own the cherusci and langobardi were fighting for ancient renown or newly-won freedom
 there were three , and poison could not be distributed among them , because of the singular fidelity of their guardians and the unassailable virtue of agrippina
while these things are being done by caesar , labienus , leaving at agendicum the recruits who had lately arrived from italy , to guard the baggage , marches with four legions to lutetia , whose arrival being discovered by the enemy , numerous forces arrived from the neighboring states .
 indeed he would have altogether thrown into the shade the activity and renown of any other successor
within these woods the enemy kept themselves in concealment ; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground , along the river .
 they next attached to their party patavium and ateste
 thus the enemy was defeated , and they reached soza , a town in dandarica , which mithridates had abandoned , where it was thought expedient to leave a garrison , as the temper of the people was uncertain
 of the tribunes , gavius silvanus , though acquitted , perished by his own hand
 reluctant and guilty , they returned to the camp
 that sejanus was such , no one will deny
 we have fallen so low , people said , that even a mere youth who has received so high an honour does not go as a worshipper to the city's gods , does not enter the senate , does not so much as take the auspices on his country's soil
the enemy spread themselves on the other sides to ascertain if they could find any access .
 then , as all with common consent demanded that vocula should be their general , hordeonius handed over to him the supreme command
 as soon as caesar heard that pompey was at asparagium , he set out for that place with his army , and having taken the capital of the parthinians on his march , where there was a garrison of pompey's , he reached pompey in macedonia , on the third day , and encamped beside him ; and the day following having drawn out all his forces before his camp , he offered pompey battle . 
 a few heard this speech with approval , but the majority clamorously objected that there was no proper motion on the subject , and that caecina was no fit censor on so grave an issue
 then the germans , the most formidable part of the enemy's forces , should the war be protracted into the summer , will sink with enfeebled frames under the change of country and climate
 even as it was , there was shamelessness enough , seeing that pallas was her paramour , so that no one could doubt that she held honour , modesty and her very person , everything , in short , cheaper than sovereignty
 one moment they would take counsel together , the next , part company , while the sight of those who were dearest to them sometimes melted their hearts , but oftener roused their fury
 an ingenious suggestion was offered by anicetus , a freedman , commander of the fleet at misenum , who had been tutor to nero in boyhood and had a hatred of agrippina which she reciprocated
 one of the common people of alexandria , well known for his blindness , threw himself at the emperor's knees , and implored him with groans to heal his infirmity this he did by the advice of the god serapis , whom this nation , devoted as it is to many superstitions , worships more than any other divinity
 the distant provinces , and all the armies beyond the sea , still adhered to otho , not from any attachment to his party , but because there was vast weight in the name of the capital and the prestige of the senate , and also because the claims which they had first heard had prepossessed their minds
labienus , as he had been ordered by caesar not to come to an engagement unless own forces were seen near the enemy's camp , that the attack upon the enemy might be made on every side at the same time , was , after having taken possession of the mountain , waiting for our men , and refraining from battle .
 consequently , our magistrates' early career is generally better than its close , which deteriorates , when we are anxiously seeking votes , like candidates
 there were more with foreign enemies
 let it be lawful for us and for you to inhabit both banks of the rhine , as it was of old for our ancestors
 an engine of remarkable size , belonging to the 15th legion , was crushing the hostile ranks with huge stones , and would have spread destruction far and wide , had not two soldiers ventured on a deed of surpassing bravery disguising themselves with shields snatched from the midst of the carnage , they cut the ropes and springs of the engine
 antonius was at this time at brundusium , and relying on the valor of his troops , covered about sixty of the long-boats belonging to the men-of-war with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles , and put on board them select soldiers ; and disposed them separately along the shore : and under the pretext of keeping the seamen in exercise , he ordered two three-banked galleys , which he had built at brundusium , to row to the mouth of the port . 
 a ghastly dream appalled the general
 the senators enjoyed the first exercise of freedom with the less restraint , because the emperor was new to power , and absent from the capital
he left the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage , one of those three which he had lately raised in italy and brought over .
 it was said that in the porch of the capitol the reins of the chariot , on which stood the goddess of victory , had dropped from her hand , that from the chapel of juno there had rushed forth a form greater than the form of man , that the statue of the divine julius , which stands on the island in the tiber , had turned from the west to the east on a calm and tranquil day , that an ox had spoken aloud in etruria , that strange births of animals had taken place , besides many other things , such as in barbarous ages are observed even during seasons of peace , but are now heard of only in times of terror
 the master is not distinguished from the slave by being brought up with greater delicacy
 the barbarians attempted to break through the outposts and to throw themselves on the engineering parties , which they harassed , pacing round them and continually charging them
 and , indeed , your vigilance , economy , and wisdom , do not inspire me with greater confidence of success than do the indolence , ignorance , and cruelty of vitellius
 it was in fact a multiplying of the magistrates five-fold , and a subversion of the laws which had prescribed proper periods for the exercise of the candidate's activity and the seeking or securing office
 to all this was added galba's own expression , i choose my soldiers , i do not buy them , noble words for the commonwealth , but fraught with peril for himself
 such , perhaps , might be the pleasure of the gods , and the emperor might be chosen to be the minister of the divine will
 never has the power of rome been more depressed
 callistus favoured the first , pallas the second
but the soldiers of the seventh legion , having formed a testudo and thrown up a rampart against the fortification , took the place and drove them out of the woods , receiving only a few wounds .
 caesar , the dictator , had fallen by sudden violence , caligula by secret treason the shades of night and the obscurity of a rural hiding-place had veiled the flight of nero
 even the sons of mithridates were butchered for having shed tears over their parent's murder
 many were deterred by the mutual jealousy of the provinces
 this was , perhaps , solicitude , perhaps espionage certain it is , that on the last day the very agonies of his dying moments were reported by a succession of couriers , and no one believed that there would be such haste about tidings which would be heard with regret
but the bellovaci , who had been previously disaffected of themselves , on learning the revolt of the aedui , began to assemble forces and openly to prepare for war .
after these had been violently struggling with one another for the superiority for many years , it came to pass that the germans were called in for hire by the arverni and the sequani .
 of this act i have heard the following account vitellius , who was suffering from severe illness , observed from the servilian gardens a neighbouring turret brilliantly illuminated throughout the night
 at break of day , it was perceived from the rising grounds which joined caesar's camp , that their rear was vigorously pressed by our horse ; that the last line sometimes halted and was broken ; at other times , that they joined battle and that our men were beaten back by a general charge of their cohorts , and , in their turn , pursued them when they wheeled about : but through the whole camp the soldiers gathered in parties , and declared their chagrin that the enemy had been suffered to escape from their hands and that the war had been unnecessarily protracted . 
 for , in former times , it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive and the boundless and , so to speak , hostile ocean beyond us , is seldom entered by a sail from our world
 at the same moment the people , bearing the images of agrippina and nero , thronged round the senate-house , and , with words of blessing on the emperor , kept shouting that the letter was a forgery and that it was not by the prince's will that ruin was being plotted against his house
 as soon as money had brought these vices to light , he became an example , warning us to beware just as much of those who under the guise of virtuous tastes are false and deceitful in friendship , as of men wholly entangled in falsehoods and stained with every infamy
 for the soldiers who had fled for refuge to it from the field of battle , affrighted and exhausted by fatigue , having thrown away their arms and military standards , had their thoughts more engaged on their further escape than on the defense of the camp . 
 the ardour of the troops was not unknown to their generals but it was judged advisable to wait for the issue of the struggle which others were carrying on
 often , while they looked behind them , they were intercepted by flames on their side or in their face or if they reached a refuge close at hand , when this too was seized by the fire , they found that , even places , which they had imagined to be remote , were involved in the same calamity
 they deserved defeat , they did not make the most of success
eporedirix , the aeduan , a young man born in the highest rank and possessing very great influence at home , and , along with viridomarus , of equal age and influence , but of inferior birth , whom caesar had raised from a humble position to the highest rank , on being recommended to him by divitiacus , had come in the number of horse , being summoned by caesar by name .
 therefore , it is to the advantage of tiridates to accept as a gift a kingdom yet unhurt by the ravages of war , and vologeses will better consult the welfare of the parthian people by an alliance with rome than by mutual injuries
 in these , if at any time necessity has compelled us on behalf of an imperilled friend to offend the ears of the powerful , our loyalty must be approved , our liberty of speech condoned
 he then pursued the route opened up in former days by lucius lucullus , clearing away the obstructions of long years
 wherefore , with the general consent , curio determined to wait for the rest of his forces , and protract the war . 
 there is nothing which you can pick out or quote , and the style is like a rough building , the wall of which indeed is strong and lasting , but not particularly polished and bright
 i will not put any man's cruelty or compassion to the test , but , while i am free and have a clear conscience , i will anticipate peril
 but we , who have seen nothing of toil and bloodshed , we , who must be contemptible even to the flavianists , what shall we answer to those who shall ask us of our victories and our defeats
they likewise discuss and impart to the youth many things respecting the stars and their motion , respecting the extent of the world and of our earth , respecting the nature of things , respecting the power and the majesty of the immortal gods .
the allobroges , placing guards along the course of the rhone , defend their frontiers with great vigilance and energy .
 these and like incitements allowed but of brief delay once having gained admission , poppaea won her way by artful blandishments , pretending that she could not resist her passion and that she was captivated by nero's person
 then began a controversy the one spoke of the greatness of rome , the resources of caesar , the dreadful punishment in store for the vanquished , the ready mercy for him who surrenders , and the fact that neither arminius's wife nor his son were treated as enemies
 with us , fatherland , wives , parents , are the motives to war
having , therefore , called a council of war a little before evening , he exhorted his soldiers to execute with diligence and energy such commands as he should give ; he assigns the ships which he had brought from melodunum to roman knights , one to each , and orders them to fall down the river silently for four miles , at the end of the fourth watch , and there wait for him .
 the standards and eagles of the victorious legions , the old and wounded soldiers , and even many effective men , were left at verona
 nor did caesar check them , seeing that without any order from himself the same men were responsible for all the cruelty and all the odium of the deed
thus they returned to the town without accomplishing their object .
 caesar replied that he should have a safe and honourable home in italy , if he would remain there , or , if his interests required something different , he might leave it under the same protection under which he had come
there was a large plain , and in it a mound of earth of considerable size .
 the flower of their youth , picked out for war , invaded her kingdom
 ptolemy then gave directions that an embassy should be despatched with presents to king scydrothemis , who at that time ruled the people of sinope , and instructed them , when they were on the point of sailing , to consult the pythian apollo
 nero , meanwhile , remembering that epicharis was in custody on the information of volusius proculus , and assuming that a woman's frame must be unequal to the agony , ordered her to be torn on the rack
 it was argued in reply that , though the guilt of a few ought to be the ruin of the men themselves , there should be no diminution of the rights of the entire class
 on the night of the departure of the legion , a part of the colonia taurina was destroyed by the fires which were left in every direction
 be it yours , my eloquent friends , to grace our age to the best of your ability , as in fact you are doing , with the noblest style of oratory you , messala , imitate , i observe , the choicest beauties of the ancients and you , maternus and secundus , combine charm and finish of ex-pression with weight of thought there is discrimination in the phrases you invent , order in the treatment of your subject , fullness , when the case demands it , conciseness , when it is possible , elegance in your style , and perspicuity in every sentence
 so the emperor made him a present of money , furnished him with an escort , and bade him enter with a good heart on the honours of his house
 the matter attracted the attention of vespasian , and induced him to dispatch some veterans from the legions under virdius geminus , a tried soldier
 at the same moment they menaced him savagely and flung stones
 soon , yielding to his natural timidity and to the alarm of his officers , who were troubled by the suspicious temper of the auxiliaries and by the fact that the ranks of the legions had been recruited by a hurried conscription , he resolved to confine his troops to the camp
 bursting into tears and praying with increasing earnestness for a milder sentence , they procured pardon and protection for the state
 varus's whole army , facing that way , saw their men flee and cut down . 
 no mention was made by me of the emperor , except as one of the divinities
 they receive one husband , as having one body and one life , that they may have no thoughts beyond , no further-reaching desires , that they may love not so much the husband as the married state
 in each case the state was torn asunder , but the eloquence of the age was exercised and , as it seemed , was loaded with great rewards for the more powerful a man was as a speaker , the more easily did he obtain office , the more decisively superior was he to his colleagues in office , the more influence did he acquire with the leaders of the state , the more weight in the senate , the more notoriety and fame with the people
after giving these admonitions he dismissed them .
 i have mentioned the proposals and sycophancy of these men , in order to bring to light this old-standing evil in the state
 vespasian thus came to conceive a deeper desire to visit the sanctuary of serapis , that he might consult the god about the interests of his throne
 yet even there , both light and heavy-armed soldiers rushed to the attack the first harassed the foe with missiles , while the latter closed with them , and the opposing ranks of the britons were broken , destitute as they were of the defence of breast-plates or helmets
 this man , who was prefect of the praetorian guard , repeatedly besought otho not to desert an army so loyal and soldiers so deserving
 many who wished him well , spoke with enthusiasm
 this had been vowed by atilius in that same war
 his other acts were not after this pattern
 they promote their picked men to power , and obey those whom they promote they keep their ranks , note their opportunities , check their impulses , portion out the day , intrench themselves by night , regard fortune as a doubtful , valour as an unfailing , resource
 the strong cities were set apart for the manufacture of arms
 the barbarians , following their individual inclinations , either came to him with entreaties , or quitted their villages and dispersed into their deserts
 this in otho's reign was perhaps due to fear
on his design being made known , they rush to arms : he is expelled from the town of gergovia , by his uncle gobanitio and the rest of the nobles , who were of opinion , that such an enterprise ought not to be hazarded : he did not however desist , but held in the country a levy of the needy and desperate .
 domitius derived lustre from a father who during the civil war had been master of the sea , till he united himself to the party of antonius and afterwards to that of caesar
 piso was sent on into the camp , as being a young man of noble name , whose popularity was of recent date , and who was a bitter enemy to t vinius , that is , either he was so in reality , or these angry partisans would have it so , and belief in hatred is but too ready
 there she reflected how for this very purpose she had been invited by a lying letter and treated with conspicuous honour , how also it was near the shore , not from being driven by winds or dashed on rocks , that the vessel had in its upper part collapsed , like a mechanism anything but nautical she pondered too the death of acerronia she looked at her own wound , and saw that her only safeguard against treachery was to ignore it
after doing this , and leaving in the camp the two legions which he had last raised , that , if there should be any occasion , they might be brought as a reserve , he formed the other six legions in order of battle before the camp .
 caesar , having landed his soldiers , sent back his ships the same night to brundusium , to transport the rest of his legions and cavalry . 
 this was noticed by those who were on the spot , then by many others
 then , when there was no one to lead a resistance , they yielded to what was offered them
 the emperor apologised for the hasty funeral by reminding people that it was the practice of our ancestors to withdraw from view any grievously untimely death , and not to dwell on it with panegyrics or display
when this circumstance was announced by scouts , caesar , having set fire to the gates , sends in the legions which he had ordered to be ready , and obtains possession of the town so completely , that very few of the whole number of the enemy escaped being taken alive , because the narrowness of the bridge and the roads prevented the multitude from escaping .
 i will refer to great examples taken not from my own but from your position
 not only are cossutianus and eprius eagerly bent on crime
 he anticipated in fact what actually happened he now urged his soldiers to enter on the battle with a good heart he then drew off the squadrons of his cavalry to the two flanks , leaving in the midst an open space in which to receive varus and his troopers
 the praetorians chose their own prefects one was plotius firmus , who had once been in the ranks , had afterwards commanded the watch , and who , while galba was yet alive , had embraced the cause of otho
 he lived to the advanced age of eighty , and had won in thrace the honour of a triumph
 the 21st , infuriated by this loss , not only repulsed the 1st , and slew the legate , orfidius benignus , but captured many colours and standards from the enemy
 our numbers are not even equal to those of the legions whom they lately defeated and the conquered , let them talk as fiercely as they will , lose something of their courage
 julius and augustus understood far better the character of the people
 nor again do even reputation and fame , the only object of their devotion , the sole reward of their labours , by their own confession , cling to the poet as much as to the orator
 yet not a soldier was more loyal to you while you deserved to be loved
 in the cases of suilius caesoninus and plautius lateranus , the extreme penalty was remitted
 envoys from the treveri were awaiting them there , and among them tullius valentinus , the most vehement promoter of the war , who in a set speech poured forth all the charges usually made against great empires , and levelled against the roman people many insulting and exasperating expressions
 thus rumours of an advancing army , as well as their own temper , inclined the states of gaul which assembled in the country of the remi to more peaceful counsels
 he was consul , and i but a youth , when he betrothed to me his daughter , a maiden even then of noble promise after his consulate he gave her to me in marriage , and was then at once appointed to the government of britain , with the addition of the sacred office of the pontificate
 but as for germanicus , even the customary distinctions due to any noble had not fallen to his lot
 his associates were slaughtered with him
 there was great weeping at these words , and then many a benediction
 while they were deliberating on these matters , intelligence was brought them that their watering parties were attacked by our horse : upon which information , they dispose several parties of horse and auxiliary foot along the road , and intermix some legionary cohorts , and begin to throw up a rampart from the camp to the water , that they might be able to procure water within their lines , both without fear , and without a guard . 
in the mean time , while they treat upon the terms , and a longer debate than necessary is designedly entered into by ambiorix , being surrounded by degrees , he is slain .
 citizens were proscribed , lands divided , without so much as the approval of those who executed these deeds
 at his house everything worthy of the highest fortune was ever before her eyes
 next they marched on the siraci , and after crossing the river panda besieged the city of uspe , which stood on high ground , and had the defence of wall and fosses only the walls , not being of stone , but of hurdles and wicker-work with earth between , were too weak to resist an assault
 when clouds arose and obstructed their sight , and it was thought she was buried in the gloom , with that proneness to superstition which steals over minds once thoroughly cowed , they lamented that this was a portent of never-ending hardship , and that heaven frowned on their deeds
 then , as usual in lovers' quarrels , there were chidings , entreaties , reproaches , excuses , and some period of the darkness was given up to passion
 sulla , six days afterwards , was murdered by assassins brought over to massilia , while he was reclining at the dinner-table , before he feared or heard of his danger
 those who had to assault the earthwork encountered heavy blows from above , as if they were scaling a wall
 he gave relief , as he went , to provinces which had been exhausted by internal feuds or by the oppressions of governors
before these , which were arranged in oblique rows in the form of a quincunx , pits three feet deep were dug , which gradually diminished in depth to the bottom .
 that day the massilians lost nine ships , including those that were taken . 
 we should have lost memory as well as voice , had it been as easy to forget as to keep silence
 but he seemed a greater personage than a simple consular legate , and all his acts were invested with an unusual importance
 it was said that he prophesied to germanicus , in dark hints , as oracles usually do , an early doom
 domitius had collected about twenty cohorts from alba , and the marsians , pelignians , and neighboring states . 
 these sentiments were delivered in the most submissive and humble language . 
 legions formed of roman citizens did not lay down their arms at pharsalia and philippi , much less were the armies of otho and vitellius likely of their own accord to abandon their strife
 so corbulo , frustrated in his prolonged efforts to bring on an engagement and compelled , like the enemy , to carry hostilities everywhere , divided his army , so that his generals and officers might attack several points simultaneously
 the same refuge screened the debtor against his creditor , as well as men suspected of capital offences no authority was strong enough to check the turbulence of a people which protected the crimes of men as much as the worship of the gods
 germany did thus actually shake off the yoke , and yet its defence was a river , not the ocean
 search was made for the body of the legate orfidius , and it was burnt with the customary honours
 so now , leaving his winter quarters , and exclaiming that not the fosse or the rampart , but the men's bodies and weapons were given him for facing the foe , he led out his legions , as if he meant to fight a battle
 our ancestors , they said , were not averse to the attractions of shows on a scale suited to the wealth of their day , and so they introduced actors from the etruscans and horse-races from thurii
 caecina was sent on in advance valens , who was just recovering from a severe illness , was delayed by weakness
 when the turret was raised to the height for flooring , they laid it on the walls in such a manner that the ends of the joists were covered by the outer face of the wall , that nothing should project to which the enemy's fire might adhere . 
 it was at this last that the accused broke silence , and burst out with the words , question thy own sons , suilius
 in like manner , lucius lentulus was seized by the king's order , and put to death in prison . 
 then fearing that they would be themselves involved in ruin , they abandoned the idea , pallas out of cowardice , and callistus , from his experience of a former court , remembering that prudent rather than vigorous counsels insure the maintenance of power
 he then severely blamed the people of carthage in an edict which betrayed his anxiety , and ceased to discharge even the usual duties of his office , shutting himself up in his palace , to guard against any casual occurrence that might lead to a new outbreak
 what good then will our mountain-passes do us

but , almost the whole camp on the front and on the left side being then exposed , since the twelfth legion was posted in the right wing , and the seventh at no great distance from it , all the nervii , in a very close body , with boduognatus , who held the chief command , as their leader , hastened toward that place ; and part of them began to surround the legions on their unprotected flank , part to make for the highest point of the encampment .

 we are handed over to prefects and centurions , and when they are glutted with our spoils and our blood , then they are changed , and new receptacles for plunder , new terms for spoliation , are discovered
it added weight also to the advice of those who reported that circumstance , that the nervii , from early times , because they were weak in cavalry , , in order that they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their neighbors if they came upon them for the purpose of plundering , having cut young trees , and bent them , by means of their numerous branches on to the sides , and the quick-briars and thorns springing up between them , had made these hedges present a fortification like a wall , through which it was not only impossible to enter , but even to penetrate with the eye .

 avitus was impressed by this language and said that people must submit to the rule of their betters
 caecina indeed had not brought up his cohorts in a body , but one by one as this was done during the battle , it increased the general confusion , because the troops who were thus divided , not being strong at any one point , were borne away by the panic of the fugitives

 in that year died memmius regulus , who from his solid worth and consistency was as distinguished as it is possible to be under the shadow of an emperor's grandeur , so much so , in fact , that nero when he was ill , with flatterers round him , who said that if aught befell him in the course of destiny , there must be an end of the empire , replied that the state had a resource , and on their asking where it was specially to be found , he added , in memmius regulus

 the pretender in this case was a slave from pontus , or , according to some accounts , a freedman from italy , a skilful harp-player and singer , accomplishments , which , added to a resemblance in the face , gave a very deceptive plausibility to his pretensions after attaching to himself some deserters , needy vagrants whom he bribed with great offers , he put to sea

all the villages and all the buildings , which each beheld , were on fire : spoil was being driven off from all parts ; the corn not only was being consumed by so great numbers of cattle and men , but also had fallen to the earth , owing to the time of the year and the storms ; so that if any had concealed themselves for the present , still , it appeared likely that they must perish through want of all things , when the army should be drawn off .

ariovistus briefly replied to the demands of caesar ; but expatiated largely on his own virtues , that he had crossed the rhine not of his own accord , but on being invited and sent for by the gauls ; that he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and great rewards ; that he had settlements in gaul , granted by the gauls themselves ; that the hostages had been given by their good-will ; that he took by right of war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered ; that he had not made war upon the gauls , but the gauls upon him ; that all the states of gaul came to attack him , and had encamped against him ; that all their forces had been routed and beaten by him in a single battle ; that if they chose to make a second trial , he was ready to encounter them again ; but if they chose to enjoy peace , it was unfair to refuse the tribute , which of their own free-will they had paid up to that time .

 all i can say is this , that neither in antonius nor in hormus would this foulest of crimes have been a degeneracy from the character of their former lives wounds or bloodshed no longer kept the men back from undermining the rampart and battering the gates supported on the shoulders of comrades , and forming a second testudo , they clambered up and seized the weapons and even the hands of the enemy the unhurt and the wounded , the half-dead and the dying , were mingled together with every incident of slaughter and death in every form
 one of these men , valens , had taken offence against galba , under the notion that he had not shewn proper gratitude for his services in discovering to him the hesitation of verginius and crushing the plans of capito
 informations abounded , and all the richest men were fastened on for plunder these intolerable oppressions , which yet found some excuse in the necessities of war , were continued even in peace vespasian himself indeed at the beginning of his reign was not so bent on enforcing these iniquitous measures , till , spoilt by prosperity and evil counsellors , he learnt this policy and ventured to use it mucianus contributed to the war even from his own purse , liberal with his private means because he helped himself without scruple from the wealth of the state
 let the emperor display from the near neighbourhood of lugdunum the might and prestige of imperial power , not meddling with trifling risks , though he would not be wanting on greater occasions
 the victims are such as each worshipper has vowed , but males are selected
 harassed by these anxieties , and absorbed in an incommunicable trouble , a sure prognostic of some cruel purpose , he decided that it was best for the present to suspend his hatred until the freshness of agricola's renown and his popularity with the army should begin to pass away
 it is reported that pompey said that day in triumph to his friends about him , that he would consent to be accounted a general of no experience , if caesar's legions effected a retreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they had rashly advanced . 
 either , as an old acquaintance of the woman , or on the strength of a recent intimacy , he divulged to her his services to nero and their barren result to himself , adding complaints , and his determination to have vengeance , should the chance arise
labienus at first attempted to raise vineae , fill up the marsh with hurdles and clay , and secure a road .
 these gauls and germans , and , i blush to say , these numerous britons , who , though they lend their lives to support a stranger's rule , have been its enemies longer than its subjects , you cannot imagine to be bound by fidelity and affection
whether ambiorix did not collect his forces from cool deliberation , because he considered he ought not to engage in a battle , or he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden arrival of our horse , when he supposed the rest of the army was closely following , is doubtful : but certainly , dispatching messengers through the country , he ordered every one to provide for himself ; and a part of them fled into the forest arduenna , a part into the extensive morasses ; those who were nearest the ocean concealed themselves in the islands which the tides usually form ; many , departing from their territories , committed themselves and all their possessions to perfect strangers .
 he had misused success so often that he was rightly suspected of a preference for war
 the iberians , he said , were not against peace , though for the moment they were the stronger
they do not pay much attention to agriculture , and a large portion of their food consists in milk , cheese , and flesh ; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits ; but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families , who have united together , as much land as , and in the place in which , they think proper , and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere .
 the ladies were fired with no less jealousy
 at the same time pompey's horse , according to their orders , rushed out at once from his left wing , and his whole host of archers poured after them . 
 over many indeed , of those who have gone before , as over the inglorious and ignoble , the waves of oblivion will roll
 gaetulicus at this time was in charge of the legions of upper germany , and had won from them singular affection , as a man of unbounded kindliness , moderate in his strictness , and popular even with the neighbouring army through his father-in-law , lucius apronius
 otherwise industry will languish and idleness be encouraged , if a man has nothing to fear , nothing to hope from himself , and every one , in utter recklessness , will expect relief from others , thus becoming useless to himself and a burden to me
 with the senate too he sought to ingratiate himself , distinguishing his partisans with offices and provinces , tiberius readily yielding , and being so biassed that not only in private conversation but before the senators and the people he spoke highly of him as the partner of his toils , and allowed his statues to be honoured in theatres , in forums , and at the head-quarters of our legions
 cnæus julius agricola was born at the ancient and famous colony of forum julii each of his grandfathers was an imperial procurator , that is , of the highest equestrian rank
 perhaps , with his usual clemency , galba has already promised that we should die , like the man , who , though no one demanded it , massacred so many thousands of perfectly guiltless soldiers
 corbulo , perfectly fearless , left half his army in syria to retain the forts built on the euphrates , and taking the nearest route , which also was not deficient in supplies , marched through the country of commagene , then through cappadocia , and thence into armenia
 as to agrippina's return , he made the excuse of her approaching confinement and of winter
they consider this the real evidence of their prowess , that their neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them , and that no one dare settle near them ; at the same time they think that they shall be on that account the more secure , because they have removed the apprehension of a sudden incursion .
 after a continuous journey for six days , on the seventh they possessed themselves of a country , from which they expelled the inhabitants , and in which they founded a city and a temple
 the strength of the timber withstood the shock ; and whatever fell on it slid off , on account of the sloping roof . 
 our all is at the disposal of those whom we have made our masters for life or death
 then the immediate neighbourhood , by the voluntary action of the inhabitants , submitted
 montanus was heard with such approval on the part of the senate , that helvidius conceived a hope that marcellus also might be overthrown
 own life was on the decline , and drusus had not yet reached his maturity thereupon , by a decree of the senate , the provinces beyond sea were entrusted to germanicus , with greater powers wherever he went than were given to those who obtained their provinces by lot or by the emperor's appointment tiberius had however removed from syria creticus silanus , who was connected by a close tie with germanicus , his daughter being betrothed to nero , the eldest of germanicus's children he appointed to it cneius piso , a man of violent temper , without an idea of obedience , with indeed a natural arrogance inherited from his father piso , who in the civil war supported with the most energetic aid against caesar the reviving faction in africa , then embraced the cause of brutus and cassius , and , when suffered to return , refrained from seeking promotion till , he was actually solicited to accept a consulship offered by augustus
 first the eighth , then the fifteenth legion returned
 to say too much about one's end is a mark of cowardice
 caecina commanded 30 , 000 from upper germany , the strength of his force being one legion , the 21st
all his cavalry being routed , vercingetorix led back his troops in the same order as he had arranged them before the camp , and immediately began to march to alesia , which is a town of the mandubii , and ordered the baggage to be speedily brought forth from the camp , and follow him closely .
 under tiberius and caius men dreaded for the commonwealth only the miseries of peace
 i come now to cicero
 i have no eye , he said , like burrus , to two conflicting aims , but only to nero's safety , which is at least secured against treachery in rome by my presence
 for four days cremona satisfied the plunderers
 as for himself , though taken from us in the prime of a vigorous manhood , yet , as far as glory is concerned , his life was of the longest
 extravagance meanwhile increased , on the strength of a chimerical hope , and ancient wealth was wasted , as apparently the emperor had lighted on treasures he might squander for many a year
 then the emperor himself , they said , went in the extreme rigour of winter as far as ticinum , and never leaving the corpse entered rome with it
 piso , he said , was my father's representative and friend , and was appointed by myself , on the advice of the senate , to assist germanicus in the administration of the east
 agrippina , that she might not be conspicuous only by her evil deeds , procured for annaeus seneca a remission of his exile , and with it the praetorship she thought this would be universally welcome , from the celebrity of his attainments , and it was her wish too for the boyhood of domitius to be trained under so excellent an instructor , and for them to have the benefit of his counsels in their designs on the throne for seneca , it was believed , was devoted to agrippina from a remembrance of her kindness , and an enemy to claudius from a bitter sense of wrong
 the histories of tiberius , caius , claudius , and nero , while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred
 paulinus pompeius and lucius vetus were then in command of the army
 orders were therefore given to the legions to advance with all speed upon cremona , while a portion of the force was to proceed to hostilia
 remove them , and those who have ceased to fear will begin to hate
 he occupied the territory of the sunici , and formed the youth of the country into regular cohorts to hinder his further advance , claudius labeo encountered him with a hastily assembled force of betasii , tungri , and nervii , relying on the strength of his position , as he had occupied a bridge over the river mosa
 the senate next passed a decree , providing alike for punishment and safety if a master were murdered by his slaves , all those who were enfranchised by his will and lived under the same roof , were to suffer the capital punishment with his other slaves
 thus the age of our orators , in conforming itself to the ear and the taste of such a class , has advanced in beauty and ornateness
 the legions were on the verge of mutiny , when hordeonius flaccus ordered the envoys to depart , and to make their departure more secret , directed them to leave the camp by night
 but as our men had on the former occasion given up all thoughts of a contest , so , warned by the event of the preceding day , they had made every preparation for a defense . 
 act the king , though caesar himself be present
 the macedonian power was now weak , while the parthian had not yet reached its full strength , and , as the romans were still far off , the jews chose kings for themselves
 varus's first camp with its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly indicated the handiwork of three legions
having by these means speedily got together a large force of infantry and of cavalry they came up to the camp .
 the senate having broken up in the evening , all who belonged to that order were summoned by pompey . 
 the senators indeed had recently , during the reign of galba , passed a resolution , that cognizance should be taken of the cases of the informers
 all , however , who were present from remote towns , and still retained the italy of strict morals and primitive ways all too who had come on embassies or on private business from distant provinces , where they had been unused to such wantonness , were unable to endure the spectacle or sustain the degrading fatigue , which wearied their unpractised hands , while they disturbed those who knew their part , and were often struck by soldiers , stationed in the seats , to see that not a moment of time passed with less vigorous applause or in the silence of indifference
 there are numbers more , daring enough , perchance , to raise the hand of violence in their brutality
 yet the italian legion and the taurine horse were withdrawn
 for , if marcellus fell , a whole army of fellow culprits was struck down
 nor did tiberius afterwards show any pity , though the house of hortensius sank into shameful poverty
 besides , if poetry is to be put on her defence , i know not a more influential defendant
 tacfarinas , his guards slain round him , his son a prisoner , and the romans bursting on him from every side , rushed on the darts , and by a death which was not unavenged , escaped captivity
 the emperor , however , argued in a letter to the senate that it had been the practice of our ancestors , whenever they broke off an intimacy , to forbid the person their house , and so put an end to friendship
 they were all kept at a distance by the intimate friends of vitellius for the emperor's ears were so formed , that all profitable counsels were offensive to him , and that he would hear nothing but what would please and ruin
 then he bestowed the usual attention on his person
 then urged by their general's appeals and mutual encouragements not to quail before a troop of frenzied women , they bore the standards onwards , smote down all resistance , and wrapped the foe in the flames of his own brands
 it was not in battle , it was not from opposing camps , it was from those same dwellings where day saw them at their common meals , night resting from labour , that they divided themselves into two factions , and showered on each other their missiles
 but distinguished above all for boundless ambition and singular daring were the legates of the legions , fabius valens and alienus caecina
 in the year of the consulship of marcus asinius and manius acilius it was seen to be portended by a succession of prodigies that there were to be political changes for the worse
behind these he raised a rampart and wall twelve feet high ; to this he added a parapet and battlements , with large stakes cut like stags' horns , projecting from the junction of the parapet and battlements , to prevent the enemy from scaling it , and surrounded the entire work with turrets , which were eighty feet distant from one another .
 drusus , on the other hand , had for his great-grandfather a roman knight , pomponius atticus , who seemed to disgrace the ancestral images of the claudii
 treat separately , he said , the case of one who is guilty only of an exaggerated filial piety , and as for myself , let me undergo any fate
we , in our inquiries about that matter , ascertained nothing , except that , by accurate measurements with water , we perceived the nights to be shorter there than on the continent .
 germanicus upon this was seized with an eager longing to pay the last honour to those soldiers and their general , while the whole army present was moved to compassion by the thought of their kinsfolk and friends , and , indeed , of the calamities of wars and the lot of mankind
 but the extent of the lines , and the incessant labor for so many days , because he had inclosed a circuit of seventeen miles with his works , did not allow time to finish them . 
 the anxieties of the terrified assembly were aggravated when the senate of mutina made them an offer of arms and money , and , with an ill-timed compliment , styled them conscript fathers
 next , servaeus , veranius , and vitellius , all with equal earnestness , vitellius with striking eloquence , alleged against piso that out of hatred of germanicus and a desire of revolution he had so corrupted the common soldiers by licence and oppression of the allies that he was called by the vilest of them father of the legions while on the other hand to all the best men , especially to the companions and friends of germanicus , he had been savagely cruel
 but germanicus protesting that he would die rather than cast off his loyalty , plucked his sword from his side , raised it aloft and was plunging it into his breast , when those nearest him seized his hand and held it by force
 vitellius found his next cause of apprehension in the praetorian cohorts
 she was accordingly put on her trial before the senate , and , although she grovelled at the knees of the senators and long urged a parent's grief , the greater weakness of a woman's mind under such an affliction and other sad and pitiful pleas of the same painful kind , she was after all banished from rome for ten years , till her younger son would have passed the frail period of youth
 caesar having discovered his intention , after spending several days to no purpose , left the city , in order that he might not lose any more time , and went to transalpine gaul , without effecting what he had intended . 
 men remembered that crispus had followed the same profession with profit nor was it the penalty but the prosecutor that they disliked
 wearied at last by the assembly's clamorous importunity and the urgent demands of individual senators , he gave way by degrees , not admitting that he undertook empire , but yet ceasing to refuse it and to be entreated
 a profligacy equally notorious in that same year proved the beginning of great evils to the state
 nor did piso give way , though augusta complained that she was insulted and her majesty slighted tiberius , to win popularity by so humouring his mother as to say that he would go to the praetor's court and support urgulania , went forth from the palace , having ordered soldiers to follow him at a distance
 hence , as in private relationships the closest ties were the strongest , so the people of rome had the most powerful claims and must be obeyed in their wish to retain him
 thus utterly regardless of all law human and divine , with freedmen and friends as reckless as himself , he lived as if he were among a set of drunkards
 corbulo in reply , when he was certain that vologeses was detained by the revolt of hyrcania , advised tiridates to address a petition to the emperor , assuring him that he might reign securely and without bloodshed by relinquishing a prospect in the remote future for the sake of one more solid within his reach
for no one even then considered it an absolutely necessary act , that changing his design he should direct his march into the province , both because the infamy and disgrace of the thing , and the intervening mount cevennes , and the difficulty of the roads prevented him ; and especially because he had serious apprehensions for the safety of labienus whom he had detached , and those legions whom he had sent with him .
 there was a stir among the company
for both the desire of booty was leading many too far , and the woods with their unknown and hidden routes would not allow them to go in large bodies .
 on the day the senate met , tiberius delivered a speech of studied moderation
after the three days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his forces .
the nation of all the gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious rites ; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe diseases , and they who are engaged in battles and dangers , either sacrifice men as victims , or vow that they will sacrifice them , and employ the druids as the performers of those sacrifices ; because they think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man , the mind of the immortal gods can not be rendered propitious , and they have sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes .
 meanwhile at rome people plunged into slavery , consuls , senators , knights
 they have no images , or , indeed , any vestige of foreign superstition , but it is as brothers and as youths that the deities are worshipped
that ariovistus , during his consulship , had most anxiously sought after the friendship of the roman people ; why should any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty ? he for his part was persuaded , that , when his demands were known and the fairness of the terms considered , he would reject neither his nor the roman people's favor .
 nero was confounded at this , and as the day was near on which britannicus would complete his fourteenth year , he reflected , now on the domineering temper of his mother , and now again on the character of the young prince , which a trifling circumstance had lately tested , sufficient however to gain for him wide popularity
 to this day we cite examples , which under our old customs the roman character exhibited as to valour and renown
to injure guests they regard as impious ; they defend from wrong those who have come to them for any purpose whatever , and esteem them inviolable ; to them the houses of all are open and maintenance is freely supplied .
 of the birth of curtius rufus , whom some affirm to have been the son of a gladiator , i would not publish a falsehood , while i shrink from telling the truth
 for here there were no houses fenced in by solid masonry , or temples surrounded by walls , or any other obstacle to interpose delay
 nor was everything better in the past , but our own age too has produced many specimens of excellence and culture for posterity to imitate
 all was known to caesar , and when maximus soon afterwards died , by a death some thought to be self-inflicted , there were heard at his funeral wailings from marcia , in which she reproached herself for having been the cause of her husband's destruction
 tiberius , drusus , claudius , and germanicus , were added to the number
 their quarrels , as might be expected with intoxicated people , are seldom fought out with mere abuse , but commonly with wounds and bloodshed
 the charge of these defensive positions he entrusted to paccius orfitus , who had held the post of a first-rank centurion
 besides this , a report was circulated that albinus , scorning the title of procurator , was assuming the insignia of royalty and the name of juba
 tiberius received the news , no longer parted by the sea , as he had been once , or through messengers from a distance , but in close proximity to rome , so that on the same day , or after the interval of a single night , he could reply to the despatches of the consuls , and almost behold the bloodshed as it streamed from house to house , and the strokes of the executioner at the year's close poppaeus sabinus died , a man of somewhat humble extraction , who had risen by his friendship with two emperors to the consulship and the honours of a triumph during twenty-four years he had the charge of the most important provinces , not for any remarkable ability , but because he was equal to business and was not too great for it
 tiberius had even thought of claudius , as he was of sedate age and had a taste for liberal culture , but a weak intellect was against him
 the title of germanicus was at once bestowed on vitellius , that of caesar he refused to accept , even after his victory
 this , it was said , maximus had divulged to his wife marcia , she again to livia
they intrusted the same declarations to the centurions and military tribunes , that through them they might be communicated to caesar .
 all this time many engines were constructed by the legionaries , who were superior to the enemy in experience and skill
in like manner , when he had come up to the town , and there pitched his camp , the boys and the women from the wall , with outstretched hands , after their custom , begged peace from the romans .
 to this he afterward transported a legion : and having begun a bridge on both sides , he finished it in two days . 
 thence he went to the river's nearest mouth , dedicated to a hercules who , the natives say , was born in the country and was the original hero , others , who afterwards showed like valour , having received his name
 that the capital of the ubii was marked out for destruction , and that hands with the stain of plunder on them would soon be daring enough for the pillage of gaul
 for he had eloquence , the art of soothing an angry crowd , and personal influence
 the rhodians also had their freedom restored to them , which had often been taken away , or confirmed , according to their services to us in our foreign wars , or their seditious misdeeds at home
 eleazar had fortified the temple
 those which you owe to me , your parks , investments , your country houses , are liable to accidents
 this provoked him to censure the magistrates and the senate for not having used the authority of the state to put down the people he named too the corn-supplying provinces , and dwelt on the far larger amount of grain imported by himself than by augustus
 vitellius , who seemed like a man roused from slumber ordered julius priscus and alfenius varus , with fourteen of the praetorian cohorts and the entire force of cavalry , to occupy the apennines
 you witnessed , comrades , how by a remarkable storm even the gods discountenanced that ill-starred adoption
 it was commonly reported that snakes had been seen by his cradle , which they seemed to guard , a fabulous tale invented to match the marvels of other lands
 having then surveyed the defences and provided everything suitable for storming them , he exhorted his soldiers to strip of his home this vagabond foe who was preparing neither for peace nor for war , but who confessed his treachery and cowardice by flight , and so to secure alike glory and spoil
 a detachment of the cavalry rode round where the hills were less steep , and captured the principal belgic chiefs , and among them valentinus , their general
 but it happened , from the justice of trebonius's decrees and his humanity for he thought that in such dangerous times justice should be administered with moderation and compassion , that not one could be found who would offer himself the first to lodge an appeal . 
 for in these the youth of augustus was spent
 the colony , situated as it is on level ground , may be taken by assault
 it was an extravagant distinction for a day of prosperity , but it served as a consolation in adversity
 nor was there a single person who did not imagine that his future fortune depended on the issue of that day ; for the choice of their youth and the most respectable of every age , being expressly invited and solicited , had gone on board the fleet , that if any adverse fate should befall them they might see that nothing was left for them to attempt , and , if they proved victorious , they might have hopes of preserving the city , either by their internal resources or by foreign assistance . 
 it was usual to select an elderly kinswoman of approved and esteemed character to have the entire charge of all the children of the household
 the bructeri and the tencteri joined him , and messengers summoned all germany to share in his plunder and his glory
 vitellius had not now the power either to command or to forbid
him , in particular , he had resolved to have with him , because he had discovered him to be fond of change , fond of power , possessing great resolution , and great influence among the gauls .
 anteius had been previously advised by him not to delay this final document
the gauls could not withstand their attack , but were put to flight , and retreated to their main body , after losing a great number of men .
 it was true that a numidian had arrived at full gallop with an angry message from otho , in which the emperor , sick of delay and impatient of suspense , sharply rebuked the inactivity of the generals , and commanded that matters should be brought to an issue
 what will be the use of having protracted the war into another summer where are we to find in the meanwhile money and supplies
 as for song and verse to which maternus wishes to devote his whole life for this was the starting-point of his entire argument , they bring no dignity to the author , nor do they improve his circumstances
 whether he was displeased and strove the more to hide his anger , is a question at any rate , he ordered the banquet to be renewed , and sat at the table longer than usual , by way , apparently , of showing honour to his departing friend
and alleging , some of them one reason , some another , which they said made it necessary for them to depart , they requested that by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw ; some , influenced by shame , stayed behind in order that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice .
while these things are being transacted in the conference it was announced to caesar that the cavalry of ariovistus were approaching nearer the mound , and were riding up to our men , and casting stones and weapons at them .
 they therefore postponed the war until a more fitting opportunity , and though vespasian and mucianus had but lately resolved on concerted action , the others had done so long before
 the adiabeni , when they began to advance their scaling ladders and engines , were easily driven back , and then cut down by a sally of our men
 he swore an oath too that he would do him no violence either by the sword or by poison
 for between the hills and the swamps there stretched a plain which would admit of an extended line
 the envoys indeed were detained for some little time , and this circumstance caused some doubt , as it was not known whether they had obtained their object
 these legions amounted but to three thousand two hundred men ; the rest , disabled by wounds received in various battles , by fatigue and the length of their march , could not follow him . 
while the fight was going on most vigorously , hand to hand , and the enemy depended on their position and numbers , our men on their bravery , the aedui suddenly appeared on our exposed flank , as caesar had sent them by another ascent on the right , for the sake of creating a diversion .
 the standards were borne along without their usual honours , while the banners of the gauls glittered on every side
 antonius , however , summoned the legions to an assembly , and endeavoured to calm them , proposing that they should encamp near the mulvian bridge , and enter the capital on the following day
 meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled , and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry
 only close up the ranks , and having discharged your javelins , then with shields and swords continue the work of bloodshed and destruction , without a thought of plunder
 sword in hand they fell upon the unarmed people
 and so between the enmity of the one and the servility of the other , neither had any regard for posterity
 historians of the time tell us that , as there was no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin , she was violated by the executioner , with the rope on her neck
 tiberius rejoiced to see a strife in the senate between his sons and the law
 of this i solemnly assure you , and would have posterity remember it they will more than sufficiently honour my memory by believing me to have been worthy of my ancestry , watchful over your interests , courageous in danger , fearless of enmity , when the state required it
 the bloody spectacle reduced them to despair , and it was amazing how the army of vespasian welcomed in their hearts the destruction of valens as the termination of the war
 intimacy with sejanus was in every case a powerful recommendation to the emperor's friendship
 but though a decree was voted by the senate on a liberal scale and without any restrictions as to rank or numbers , he never so much as went near the walls of rome , much less the state-council , for he would often go round and avoid his native city by circuitous routes
 he indeed had advanced with the whole strength of his kingdom against two legions , while the romans had all the rest of the world with which to sustain the war
 he was as cringing as he was imperious
 this officer contrived , under an appearance of submission , to govern silvanus , a leader without vigour , and apt to waste in words the opportunities of action
 they were not , they said , unaware of the treaty of alliance , nor did their coming imply any revolt from the family of the arsacids indeed , even the son of vonones , phraates's grandson , was with them in their resistance to the despotism of gotarzes , which was alike intolerable to the nobility and to the people
 a donative was also given to the soldiery in nero's name , and presents to the city populace
having entered upon this resolution , he sends the baggage of the whole army to labienus , in the territories of the treviri and orders two legions to proceed to him : he himself proceeds against the menapii with five lightly-equipped legions .
 some persons under the soldiers' garb murdered their private enemies
 such wide extremes of license and of subordination were to be found in that army
 last of all , there was livia , terrible to the state as a mother , terrible to the house of the caesars as a stepmother
 next the people of magnesia relied on arrangements made by lucius scipio and lucius sulla these generals , after respectively defeating antiochus and mithridates , honoured the fidelity and courage of the magnesians by allowing the temple of diana of the white brow to be an inviolable sanctuary
 urged by conflicting emotions , they felt panic and they caused the like
 as they have ended their days , i think it due to their ancestors not to hand down their names
 on the 15th of march , his breath failing , he was believed to have expired , and caius caesar was going forth with a numerous throng of congratulating followers to take the first possession of the empire , when suddenly news came that tiberius was recovering his voice and sight , and calling for persons to bring him food to revive him from his faintness
 for even on one of those days he was successful in a cavalry action , and killed one of the two allobrogians , who had deserted to pompey , as we before observed , and several others . 
 the country , terror-stricken and ready to acquiesce in servitude , urgently demanded that lucius vitellius with his cohorts should be intercepted on his way from tarracina , and that the last sparks of war should be trodden out
 better and more loving was the act of the man who offered me the sword
 milichus was enriched with gifts and assumed in its greek equivalent the name of saviour
 this terminated the proceedings for that day
 their leader was claudius sanctus
but , while the minds of all were occupied , dumnorix began to take his departure from the camp homeward with the cavalry of the aedui , caesar being ignorant of it .
 trebellius , who was somewhat indolent , and never ventured on a campaign , controlled the province by a certain courtesy in his administration
 this contained a description of the resources of the state , of the number of citizens and allies under arms , of the fleets , subject kingdoms , provinces , taxes , direct and indirect , necessary expenses and customary bounties
attacking them encumbered with baggage , and not expecting him , he cut to pieces a great part of them ; the rest betook themselves to flight , and concealed themselves in the nearest woods .
 in the consulship of marcus silanus and lucius norbanus , germanicus set out for egypt to study its antiquities
 the conquerors and the conquered , it was said , never unite with a genuine good faith it matters not whether fortune make otho or vitellius to be the victor
 notice of this being given by the scouts , caesar continued his work day and night , with very great fatigue to the soldiers , to drain the river , and so far effected his purpose , that the horse were both able and bold enough , though with some difficulty and danger , to pass the river ; but the foot had only their shoulders and upper part of their breast above the water , so that their fording it was retarded , not only by the depth of the water , but also by the rapidity of the current . 
 the war was so far from being at an end , that civilis in one day attacked on four points the positions of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry and of the legions , assailing the tenth legion at arenacum , the second at batavodurum , and the camp of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry at grinnes and vada , and so dividing his forces , that he himself , his sister's son verax , classicus , and tutor , led each his own division they were not confident of accomplishing all these objects , but they hoped that , if they made many ventures , fortune would favour them on some one point
 that the disturbance , which had gone as far as stoning and threats of fire , might not lead on to bloodshed and armed fighting , caius cassius was appointed to apply some remedy
 the levies were stopped within the city no place on this side of capua was thought secure . 
 but in these days we have our youths taken to the professors' theatre , the rhetoricians , as we call them the class made its appearance a little before cicero's time , and was not liked by our ancestors , as is evident from the fact that , when crassus and domitius were censors , they were ordered , as cicero says , to close the school of impudence
 the enthusiasm too of the populace was not even slightly kindled , for the pantomimic actors , though permitted to return to the stage , were excluded from the sacred contests
at daybreak the cavalry of the enemy approaches to the camp and joins battle with our horse .
 rhadamistus had no means of escape but in the swiftness of the horses which bore him and his wife away
 then did otho venture to enter the camp the tribunes and centurions surrounded him
 in his hatred of otho he resolved to support vitellius with the whole strength of corsica , an insignificant assistance even had the design succeeded
these places were known to those who dwelt in the neighborhood , and the matter demanded great attention , not so much in protecting the main body of the army , as in preserving individual soldiers ; which in some measure tended to the safety of the army .
 six liburnian ships with apollinaris , prefect of the fleet , escaped in the first confusion
 and he also alleged that the cohort stationed at ostia had been tampered with
 there were often wars that had both characters at once
 do you , whom ties of blood or your own true-heartedness have made his advocates , help him in his peril , every one of you , as far as each man's eloquence and diligence can do so
 certainly some restraint , they admitted , must be put on the cupidity of the revenue collectors , that they might not by new oppressions bring into odium what for so many years had been endured without a complaint
 all these events in germany took place before the battle of cremona , the result of which was announced in a despatch from antonius , accompanied by caecina's proclamation
this place was distant from the enemy about 600 paces , as has been stated .
 the senate was then consulted and sentences of exile were passed on cassius and silanus
when this battle was finished , labienus returns to agendicum , where the baggage of the whole army had been left : from it he marched with all his forces to caesar .
 there were other questions of the same sort , quite senseless and idle
 meanwhile no mere rumour but messengers from all parts brought the news that everything was known to claudius , and that he was coming , bent on vengeance
 it was carried by acclamation that the son of blaesus , one of the tribunes , should undertake the mission , and demand for the soldiers release from service after sixteen years
 and so while maecenas lived , he stood next in favour to him , and was afterwards the chief depository of imperial secrets , and accessory to the murder of postumus agrippa , till in advanced age he retained the shadow rather than the substance of the emperor's friendship
here the centrones and the graioceli and the caturiges , having taken possession of the higher parts , attempt to obstruct the army in their march .
 if the stability of the empire or the safety of gaul were in danger , it would have been right for caesar to take his place in the field but the canninefates and batavi should be handed over to inferior generals
 it was accordingly decided that the different states were to send their charters and envoys to rome
 but tiberius , when silanus thanked him , replied in the senate's presence , that he too rejoiced at the brother's return from his long foreign tour , and that this was justly allowable , inasmuch as he had been banished not by a decree of the senate or under any law
 as they exist now , they are indeed more favourable to truth , but the forum in those days was a better training for eloquence there no speaker was under the necessity of concluding within a very few hours there was freedom of adjournment , and every one fixed for himself the limits of his speech , and there was no prescribed number of days or of counsel
 with them he marched by hasty journeys to corfinium , to domitius aenobarbus , and informed him that caesar was advancing with two legions . 
 she then ordered search to be made for the will of acerronia , and her property to be sealed , in this alone throwing off disguise
 but who has a better claim to unravel it than yourself , you who to profound learning and transcendent ability have added reflection and study
 titidius labeo , vistilia's husband , was judicially called on to say why with a wife whose guilt was manifest he had neglected to inflict the legal penalty
 about the same time the people of carmona , which is by far the strongest state in the whole province , of themselves drove out of the town the cohorts , and shut the gates against them , although three cohorts had been detached by varro to garrison the citadel . 
 fleetness and timidity go together
 the soldiers , being affected by this oration , frequently attempted to interrupt him while he was speaking , so that they appeared to bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery , and when he was leaving the assembly they unanimously besought him to be of good spirits , and not hesitate to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and courage to a trial . 
 nero entered on his third consulship with valerius messala , whose great-grandfather , the orator corvinus , was still remembered by a few old men , as having been the colleague of the divine augustus , nero's great-grandfather , in the same office
 at their instigation the surrounding nations chose as a battlefield a spot walled in by a rude barrier , with a narrow approach , impenetrable to cavalry
 she had clasped his bleeding neck , and still kept by her the blood-stained apparel , clinging in her widowhood to perpetual sorrow , and using only such nourishment as might suffice to avert starvation
 caesar , having recovered asculum and driven out lentulus , ordered the soldiers that had deserted from him to be sought out and a muster to be made ; and , having delayed for one day there to provide corn , he marched to corfinium . 
these things being discovered from prisoners and deserters , caesar , sending forward the cavalry , ordered the legions to follow them immediately .
 this furnished relief
 the captains , perhaps wavering , perhaps intending to deceive , declared that they must address their soldiers , and that they would return when the minds of all had been prepared
throughout all gaul there are two orders of those men who are of any rank and dignity : for the commonality is held almost in the condition of slaves , and dares to undertake nothing of itself , and is admitted to no deliberation .
 then , when he was pressed , he embraced the glory of a full confession questioned by nero as to the motives which had led him on to forget his oath of allegiance , i hated you , he replied
 how long will you besiege the emperor's son
 tiberius was much excited , and though he pacified piso with gentle words , he also strongly urged his relatives to stop his departure by their influence or their entreaties
 there are still to be seen in the groves of germany the roman standards which i hung up to our country's gods
 women excited to frenzy prophesied impending destruction ravings in a strange tongue , it was said , were heard in their senate-house their theatre resounded with wailings , and in the estuary of the tamesa had been seen the appearance of an overthrown town
 meanwhile the companies which previous to the mutiny had been sent to nauportus to make roads and bridges and for other purposes , when they heard of the tumult in the camp , tore up the standards , and having plundered the neighbouring villages and nauportus itself , which was like a town , assailed the centurions who restrained them with jeers and insults , last of all , with blows their chief rage was against aufidienus rufus , the camp-prefect , whom they dragged from a waggon , loaded with baggage , and drove on at the head of the column , asking him in ridicule whether he liked to bear such huge burdens and such long marches
 for while some seized on consulships and priestly offices , as their share of the spoil , others on procuratorships , and posts of more confidential authority , they robbed and ruined in every direction amid universal hatred and terror
 nero next appointed three ex-consuls , lucius piso , ducennius geminus , and pompeius paulinus , to the management of the public revenues , and inveighed at the same time against former emperors whose heavy expenditure had exceeded their legitimate income
one part of these , which it has been said that the galli occupy , takes its beginning at the river rhône ; it is bounded by the river garonne , the ocean , and the territories of the belgae ; it borders , too , on the side of the sequani and the helvetii , upon the river rhine , and stretches toward the north .
 he had besides two cohorts of volunteers , who having received favors from him in former wars , flocked to his standard : these were dispersed through his whole army . 
 varus was at once dispatched with a lightly equipped force , and cut to pieces a few who attempted to resist
 the centurions he promoted to higher ranks , and conferred on the roman knights the honor of tribunes . 
 nor would he suffer antonius primus to be taken into the number of domitian's attendants , for he felt uneasy at his popularity with the troops , and feared the proud spirit of the man , who could not endure an equal , much less a superior
 to this tiridates advanced , and having slain the customary victims , he removed the crown from his head , and set it at the foot of the statue whereupon all felt a deep thrill of emotion , rendered the more intense by the sight which yet lingered before their eyes , of the slaughter or siege of roman armies
the nature of the place was this : the sea was confined by mountains so close to it that a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore .
 when they have been plundered and stripped , they will be friends
 vocula then left them , and was preparing to put an end to his life , when his freedmen and slaves prevented him from anticipating by his own act a most miserable death
 we are now starting for a campaign
 and to provide that the water which individual license had illegally appropriated , might flow in greater abundance in several places for the public use , officers were appointed , and everyone was to have in the open court the means of stopping a fire
 the germans were equally brave , but they were beaten by the nature of the fighting and of the weapons , for their vast host in so confined a space could neither thrust out nor recover their immense lances , or avail themselves of their nimble movements and lithe frames , forced as they were to a close engagement
 the result of this battle roused both generals , though from different motives , to hasten on the final struggle
sabinus orders those tribunes of the soldiers whom he had at the time around him , and the centurions of the first ranks , to follow him , and when he had approached near to ambiorix , being ordered to throw down his arms , he obeys the order and commands his men to do the same .
 as yet , he said , you have not contracted any inexpiable guilt , and you need not dread feeble suspicions or vague rumours
 already domitius , scipio , and lentulus spinther , in their daily quarrels about caesar's priesthood , openly abused each other in the most scurrilous language . 
 the rapacity of magistrates , in the calpurnian enactments
 but all this had no effect on plautus either he saw no resource before him , an unarmed exile as he was , or he was weary of an uncertain hope , or was swayed by his love of his wife and of his children , to whom he thought the emperor , if harassed by no anxiety , would be more merciful
 however , when his obsequies had been duly performed , a temple with a religious ritual was decreed him
 far different was the appearance of the german army as it marched out of the capital
 as the mutiny grew fiercer , and the soldiers went on from abuse and taunts to use their hands and their weapons , he ordered that flavianus should be put in irons
 his character was of an average kind , rather free from vices , than distinguished by virtues
 equestrian rank was conferred on hormus
 that the soldiers should retain their immunities except when they traded for profit , with other very equitable arrangements , which for a short time were maintained and were subsequently disregarded
 for as the dread of a charge of extortion has been a check to rapacity , so , by prohibiting the vote of thanks , will the pursuit of popularity be restrained
 the cavalry with some light infantry was sent to attack them , and fought without any decisive result
therefore , having put to the sword the garrison of noviodunum , and those who had assembled there for the purpose of trading or were on their march , they divided the money and horses among themselves ; they took care that the hostages of the states should be brought to bibracte , to the chief magistrate ; they burned the town to prevent its being of any service to the romans , as they were of opinion that they could not hold it ; they carried away in their vessels whatever corn they could in the hurry , they destroyed the remainder , by into the river or setting it on fire , they themselves began to collect forces from the neighboring country , to place guards and garrisons in different positions along the banks of the loire , and to display the cavalry on all sides to strike terror into the romans , if they could cut them off from a supply of provisions .
 for to plead poverty , to complain of his own private calamities , or the general distresses of the times , or to assert the difficulty of setting the goods to sale , is the behavior of a man even of a moderate temper ; but to retain their possessions entire , and at the same time acknowledge themselves in debt , what sort of spirit , and what impudence would it not have argued ! therefore nobody was found so unreasonable as to make such demands . 
 lucilius was put under honourable arrest , and conveyed as far as adria by the liburnian ships there he was thrown into prison by vivennius rufinus , prefect of a squadron of cavalry , which was there in garrison his chains , however , were immediately struck off on the interference of hormus , one of the emperor's freedmen , for he too ranked among the generals
 whether he had forgotten , or only postponed his resentment , the shortness of his reign left undecided
 two daggers were brought to him
 their shields alone are marked with very choice colours
 it was also certain that many obligations under which they had laid rome and joint victories with her might have been recounted
 the royal power , which had been bestowed by antony on herod , was augmented by the victorious augustus
 they were however publicly mulcted of their arms , and furnished the soldiers with all kinds of supplies from their private means
 this was opposed by agrippina , as a reversal of the legislation of claudius , but it was carried by the senators who used to be summoned to the palace , in order that she might stand close to a hidden door behind them , screened by a curtain which was enough to shut her out of sight , but not out of hearing
 this opinion was hailed with great unanimity , but the senate's resolution could not be finally passed , as the consuls decided that there had been no formal motion on the subject
 some explained it with more subtlety , of a successful commencement to the enterprise , which , however , would not be lasting , on the ground , that though a confident trust might be placed in prognostics given in the earth or in the heavens , the fluctuating character of rivers exhibited omens which vanished the same moment
 piso meanwhile sent his son on to rome with a message intended to pacify the emporer , and then made his way to drusus , who would , he hoped , be not so much infuriated at his brother's death as kindly disposed towards himself in consequence of a rival's removal
 the higher in rank is the charioteer
 my purpose is not to relate at length every motion , but only such as were conspicuous for excellence or notorious for infamy this i regard as history's highest function , to let no worthy action be uncommemorated , and to hold out the reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and deeds so corrupted indeed and debased was that age by sycophancy that not only the foremost citizens who were forced to save their grandeur by servility , but every exconsul , most of the ex-praetors and a host of inferior senators would rise in eager rivalry to propose shameful and preposterous motions
 the allied infantry and cavalry were placed in new winter quarters , and whatever tribes still wavered or were hostile were ravaged with fire and sword
 agricola did not see the senate-house besieged , or the senate hemmed in by armed men , or so many of our consulars falling at one single massacre , or so many of rome's noblest ladies exiles and fugitives
 what , they cried , has the glory of the army of germany fallen so low , that without a battle , even without a wound , they should yield up hands ready bound and arms resigned to surrender
 agrippina and acerronia were protected by the projecting sides of the couch , which happened to be too strong to yield under the weight
 in two days after caesar came to the camp with nine hundred horse , which he had retained for a body guard . 
 the little children have no shelter from wild beasts and storms but a covering of interlaced boughs
 soon afterwards cerialis laid violent hands on himself , and received less pity than the others , because men remembered that he had betrayed a conspiracy to caius caesar
 a stranger to the enemy's misdeeds and so more accessible to their penitence , he put an end to old troubles , and , attempting nothing more , handed the province over to trebellius maximus
 most writers , however , agree in stating that once a disease , which horribly disfigured the body , broke out over egypt that king bocchoris , seeking a remedy , consulted the oracle of hammon , and was bidden to cleanse his realm , and to convey into some foreign land this race detested by the gods
vercingetorix , after sustaining such a series of losses at vellaunodunum , genabum , and noviodunum , summons his men to a council .
 here was , so to say , a weapon for the accusers , on which they fastened
 the dark complexion of the silures , their usually curly hair , and the fact that spain is the opposite shore to them , are an evidence that iberians of a former date crossed over and occupied these parts
 caesar being greatly alarmed on this account , while the enemy were engaged in battle , landed his soldiers , seized the pharos , and placed a garrison in it . 
 immediately summoning to arms the frisii , a tribe of the farther bank of the rhine , he assailed by sea the winter quarters of two cohorts , which was the nearest point to attack
 the next day , they left a guard in the camp , and led out all their forces to water : but not a person was sent to look for forage . 
then , indeed , he thought that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding toward them , and having provided supplies , moves his camp , and in about fifteen days arrives at the territories of the belgae .
 valens was so notorious for his dishonest gains and peculations that he was disposed to conceal the crimes of others
 nero waited in the hope that vestinus also , the consul , whom he thought an impetuous and deeply disaffected man , would be involved in the charge none however of the conspirators had shared their counsels with him , some from old feuds against him , most because they considered him a reckless and dangerous associate
 statius proximus threw away the benefit of the pardon he had accepted from the emperor by the folly of his end
that the friendship of the roman people ought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard , not a detriment ; and that he sought it with that expectation .
so far did it operate among those barbarian people , that there were found some to be the first to wage war ; and so great a change of inclinations did it produce in all , that , except the aedui and the remi , whom caesar had always held in especial honor , the one people for their long standing and uniform fidelity toward the roman people , the other for their late service in the gallic war , there was scarcely a state which was not suspected by us .
 even with these little pains are taken , and on the reading of authors , on the study of antiquity and a knowledge of facts , of men and of periods , by no means enough labour is bestowed
 they will not sustain even the din and the shout of so many thousands , much less our charge and our blows
 vitellius refused , and afterwards bestowed on simplex a consulship that had not to be bought with crime or with money
 we do not follow the advice of traitors or enemies
 about this time achaia and asia minor were terrified by a false report that nero was at hand various rumours were current about his death and so there were many who pretended and believed that he was still alive
 the building was densely crowded then came a violent shock , as it fell inwards or spread outwards , precipitating and burying an immense multitude which was intently gazing on the show or standing round
 for this was more to rome's interest than for him to have succeeded with glory
 the men's troubles were increased by an early winter with continuous storms so violent that they could not go beyond their tents or meet together or keep the standards in their places , from which they were perpetually tom by hurricane and rain
 abudius ruso too , who had been an aedile , in seeking to imperil lentulus gaetulicus , under whom he had commanded a legion , by alleging that he had fixed on a son of sejanus for his son-in-law , was himself actually condemned and banished from rome
 this led to incessant and outspoken remonstrances among the common people , who have less discretion and are exposed to fewer dangers than others from the insignificance of their position
 during the same consulship a gymnasium was wholly consumed by a stroke of lightning , and a statue of nero within it was melted down to a shapeless mass of bronze
 so he must not hesitate to prefer a bloodless negotiation to arms
 primus and varus , having occupied aquileia , were joyfully welcomed in the neighbourhood , and in the towns of opitergium and altinum
 at , last , in their fury they went so far as to propose to combine the three legions into one
 mariccus was captured in the engagement , and was soon after exposed to wild beasts , but not having been torn by them was believed by the senseless multitude to be invulnerable , till he was put to death in the presence of vitellius
there some few , either relying on their strength , endeavored to swim over , or , finding boats , procured their safety .
 yet these do not touch the emperor or the emperor's mother , who are alone comprehended under the law of treason
 well-matched and vigorous they wed , and the offspring reproduce the strength of the parents
 meanwhile gaul , spain , and italy vied in repairing the losses of the army , offering whatever they had at hand , arms , horses , gold
 a legion which dared to fight has perished
 of this war , its origin and its issue , for it lasted long , i shall hereafter speak
when a state either repels war waged against it , or wages it against another , magistrates are chosen to preside over that war with such authority , that they have power of life and death .
 there were three civil wars
 thus , with angry feelings on both sides , the combatants parted
 for himself , he said , that as he had now lost a brother's help , his remaining hopes centred in the state , and all the more tenderness ought to be shown by the senate and people towards a prince who was the only survivor of a family born to the highest greatness
 ready to march and eager for action , they loudly demanded the signal for starting
 the tide of feeling turned , and asinius pollio , one of the stanchest friends of albinus , prefect of one of the squadrons of cavalry , with festus and scipio , prefects of two infantry cohorts , were killed
 that same year tacfarinas who had been defeated , as i have related , by camillus in the previous summer , renewed hostilities in africa , first by mere desultory raids , so swift as to be unpunished next , by destroying villages and carrying off plunder wholesale
 the persuasive , as being comparatively easy and requiring less skill , is given to boys the controversial is assigned to riper scholars , and , good heavens ! what strange and astonishing productions are the result ! it comes to pass that subjects remote from all reality are actually used for declamation
 the speech is extant , and in it he magnifies the man's power , the ferocity of the tribes under his sway , his proximity to italy as a foe , finally his own measures for his overthrow
 these were bygones , but there was a fresh charge involving the daughter in the peril of the father , to the effect that she had lavished money on astrologers
 at break of day , caesar ordered all those who had taken post on the mountain , to come down from the higher grounds into the plain , and pile their arms . 
 asiaticus , he said , had been the ringleader in the murder of a caesar , and then had not feared to face an assembly of the roman people , to own the deed , and challenge its glory for his own
 the men , abandoning themselves to debauchery and revelry and all the license of nightly gatherings , revived their old grudge against hordeonius without a single legate or tribune venturing to check them , for the darkness seems to have taken from them all sense of shame , they dragged him out of his bed and killed him
 in his train were envoys from the garamantes , a rare spectacle in rome the nation , in its terror at the destruction of tacfarinas , and innocent of any guilty intention , had sent them to crave pardon of the roman people
he therefore determined to send embassadors to ariovistus to demand of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between the two , that he wished to treat him on state-business and matters of the highest importance to both of them .
 thus what was the name of a tribe , and not of a race , gradually prevailed , till all called themselves by this self-invented name of germans , which the conquerors had first employed to inspire terror
 in the two actions of this day , caesar lost nine hundred and sixty rank and file , several roman knights of distinction , felginas tuticanus gallus , a senator's son ; caius felginas from placentia ; aulus gravius from puteoli ; marcus sacrativir from capua ; and thirty-two military tribunes and centurions . 
 upon receiving this intelligence , pompey , who had already formed the design of attempting a sally , as before mentioned , ordered the soldiers to make ozier coverings for their helmets , and to provide fascines . 
 but beneath all this was a vigorous mind , equal to the greatest labours , the more active in proportion as he made a show of sloth and apathy
 as the spaniards were making toward it in an oblique direction , caesar's horse espied them and attacked them , nor were they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment , but were all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the two armies . 
 no exile ever filled the eyes of beholders with tears of greater compassion some still remembered agrippina , banished by tiberius , and the yet fresher memory of julia , whom claudius exiled , was present to men's thoughts
 from the dregs of the people there thronged buffoons , players , and charioteers , known to vitellius from their infamous compliance with his vices for in such disgraceful friendships he felt a strange pleasure
the helvetii , compelled by the want of every thing , sent embassadors to him about a surrender .
 often he was wrought upon by the gifts and promises of the ambassadors
 even amidst such perils valens could not keep himself clear of the infamous reputation of grasping at unlawful gratifications and polluting the houses of his hosts with intrigue and violation
 sometimes even it chooses the right man
when caesar sent embassadors to them , to demand that they should give up to him those who had made war against him and against gaul , they replied , that the rhine bounded the empire of the roman people ; if he did not think it just for the germans to pass over into gaul against his consent , why did he claim that any thing beyond the rhine should be subject to his dominion or power ? the ubii , also , who alone , out of all the nations lying beyond the rhine , had sent embassadors to caesar , and formed an alliance and given hostages , earnestly entreated that he would bring them assistance , because they were grievously oppressed by the suevi ; or , if he was prevented from doing so by the business of the commonwealth , he would at least transport his army over the rhine ; that that would be sufficient for their present assistance and their hope for the future ; that so great was the name and the reputation of his army , even among the most remote nations of the germans , arising from the defeat of ariovistus and this last battle which was fought , that they might be safe under the fame and friendship of the roman people .
 at the same time the fleet was moved up the stream
besides that happened , which would necessarily be the case , that the soldiers for the most part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry off from the baggage whatever each thought valuable , and all parts were filled with uproar and lamentation .
 from this place they again ventured to emerge , slaughtering the foremost of the praetorian cavalry
 he had entered , and was absorbed in worship , when he saw behind him one of the chief men of egypt , named basilides , whom he knew at the time to be detained by sickness at a considerable distance , as much as several days journey from alexandria
 and to this conflagration there attached the greater infamy because it broke out on the aemilian property of tigellinus , and it seemed that nero was aiming at the glory of founding a new city and calling it by his name
 the cherusci were posted by themselves on the high ground , so as to rush down on the romans during the battle
 in fact , before the death of these two men and it was by his death that otho gained high renown , as vitellius incurred by his the foulest infamy , vitellius with his indolent luxury was less dreaded than otho with his ardent passions the murder of galba had made the one terrible and odious , while no one reckoned against the other the guilt of having begun the war
 suetonius paullinus and licinius proculus , taking different roads , avoided the camp
 all that he could do in the confusion was to order the veteran troops to strengthen the centre
having commended the soldiers and those who had presided over the work , he informs them what he wishes to be done , and orders all the ships to assemble at port itius , from which port he had learned that the passage into britain was shortest , about thirty miles from the continent .
 he reminded them that the treveri had been beaten , that the ubii had submitted , that the batavi had had their country taken from them , and that from the friendship of civilis nothing else had been gained but wounds , defeat , and mourning
 so , while they dropped hints among themselves or among their friends about the emperor's crimes , the approaching end of empire , and the importance of choosing some one to rescue the state in its distress , they associated with them tullius senecio , cervarius proculus , vulcatius araricus , julius augurinus , munatius gratus , antonius natalis , and marcius festus , all roman knights
 celer , as i have related , had murdered silanus , the pro-consul , and the magnitude of this crime veiled his other enormities
 our cavalry also , on either flank , though stationed on sloping or low ground , yet bravely struggled up to the top of the hill , and , riding between the two armies , made our retreat more easy and secure . 
 if , said they , your accomplices join your enterprise , those also who are yet undecided , will follow , and great will be the fame of the movement once started , and this in any new scheme is all-powerful
 otho was giving a crowded entertainment to the most distinguished men and women of rome
 accordingly on hearing of the death of augustus , a rabble of city slaves , who had been enlisted under a recent levy at rome , habituated to laxity and impatient of hardship , filled the ignorant minds of the other soldiers with notions that the time had come when the veteran might demand a timely discharge , the young , more liberal pay , all , an end of their miseries , and vengeance on the cruelty of centurions
 meanwhile vitellius , as yet unaware of his victory , was bringing up the remaining strength of the army of germany just as if the campaign had yet to be fought
 they therefore resolved to quit their posts , and to transfer the war to celtiberia . 
 these strange waters support what is thrown upon them , as on a solid surface , and all persons , whether they can swim or no , are equally buoyed up by the waves
 civilis too was beset by other fears he was afraid that the 14th legion , supported by the fleet from britain , might do mischief to the batavi along their line of coast
 to this vologeses replied nothing to the purpose , but merely that he must wait for his brothers pacorus and tiridates , that the place and time of their meeting had been fixed on as the occasion when they would decide about armenia , and that heaven had granted them a further honour , well worthy of the arsacids , the having to determine the fate of roman legions
 the struggle was hottest round the eagles , which could neither be carried in the face of the storm of missiles , nor planted in the miry soil
 a story was invented that the father and son shared between them a knowledge of the conspiracy , and a letter was forged in lucanus's name
he himself during the fourth watch , hastens to them by the same route by which the enemy had gone , and sends on all the cavalry before him .
 to oppose whom , caesar sent his horse , and intermixed with them about four hundred of his advanced light troops , who attacked their horse with such success , that having routed them all , and killed several , they returned without any loss to the main body . 
 he was not , he said , to be conquered by terror or by threats
 his reason for delay was the fear that the soldiers , once exasperated by conflict , would respect neither the people nor the senate , nor even the shrines and temples of the gods
 the 13th legion was ordered to take up its position on the raised causeway of the via postumia , supported on the left by the 7th galba's which was posted in the plain , next came the 7th claudius' , defended in front by a field-ditch , such being the character of the ground
 when , he said , will you dare to demand relief , if you do not go with your prayers or arms to a new and yet tottering throne
 but my most unhappy father knows nothing , and , if it is a crime , i alone am guilty
the centurions , some of whom had been promoted for their valor from the lower ranks of other legions to higher ranks in this legion , in order that they might not forfeit their glory for military exploits previously acquired , fell together fighting most valiantly .
unless there was some aid in caesar and the roman people , the gauls must all do the same thing that the helvetii have done , emigrate from their country , and seek another dwelling place , other settlements remote from the germans , and try whatever fortune may fall to their lot .
 the question you have raised , said secundus , is a great one and quite worthy of discussion
 and the emperor who was challenged by that war was not a vitellius , but a caesar augustus
 but a people so many years indulgently treated , he did not yet venture to put under harsher control
 sinnaces he put off by pretexts and presents , and also by various employments phraates meanwhile , on arriving in syria , where he threw off the roman fashions to which for so many years he had been accustomed , and adapted himself to parthian habits , unable to endure the customs of his country , was carried off by an illness
by constantly attacking them on their march they strip them of all their baggage ; they besiege day and night those that resisted ; when many were slain on both sides , they excite a great number to arms .
 evodus , one of the freedmen , was appointed to watch and complete the affair
 in war it is the strong who plunders
 no confidence was placed in the legion levied from the fleet , which had been enraged by the massacre of their comrades , whom galba had slaughtered immediately on his entry into the capital
under these circumstances , our men being dismayed by the novelty of this mode of battle , caesar most seasonably brought assistance ; for upon his arrival the enemy paused , and our men recovered from their fear ; upon which thinking the time unfavorable for provoking the enemy and coming to an action , he kept himself in his own quarter , and , a short time having intervened , drew back the legions into the camp .
 knowing this , and elated by their glory , our army exclaimed that nothing could resist their valour that they must penetrate the recesses of caledonia , and at length after an unbroken succession of battles , discover the furthest limits of britain
 the same honours were decreed to the memory of drusus as to that of germanicus , and many more were added
 added to this were the wailings of terror-stricken women , the feebleness of age , the helpless inexperience of childhood , the crowds who sought to save themselves or others , dragging out the infirm or waiting for them , and by their hurry in the one case , by their delay in the other , aggravating the confusion
 this , as the haruspices agreed , was an omen of brilliant success , and the highest distinction seemed prophesied to vespasian in early youth at first , however , the honours of a triumph , his consulate , and the glory of his victories in judaea , appeared to have justified the truth of the omen
 the citadel , however , which had been closed by an intrepid band of youths , was not stormed without a struggle
 so ripe were the disaffected for mutiny and so close the secrecy preserved by the loyal , that they would actually have seized otho on the 14th of january , as he was returning from dinner , had they not been deterred by the risks of darkness , the inconvenient dispersion of the troops over the whole city , and the difficulty of concerted action among a half-intoxicated crowd it was no care for the state , which they deliberately meditated polluting with the blood of their emperor it was a fear lest in the darkness of night any one who presented himself to the soldiers of the pannonian or german army might be fixed on instead of otho , whom few of them knew
 the tradition of antiquity recognises only an altar and its sacred association
 among themselves nothing is unlawful
 julius paullus and claudius civilis , scions of the royal family , ranked very high above the rest of their nation
 scipio , as soon as he received advice of the departure of the armies from dyrrachium , had marched with his legions to larissa : pompey was not yet arrived near thessaly . 
 in this , and in this only , will we place germanicus above the laws , by conducting the inquiry into his death in this house instead of in the forum , and before the senate instead of before a bench of judges
 accordingly , the day following , he set out with all his forces by a long circuit , through a difficult and narrow road to dyrrachium ; hoping , either that pompey would be compelled to follow him to dyrrachium , or that his communication with it might be cut off , because he had deposited there all his provisions and material of war . 
that never before this time did a roman army go beyond the frontiers of the province of gaul .
 as the men in their alarm made confused movements , rowers and combatants were mingled together in disorder upon this , the germans themselves leapt into the shallows , laid hold of the boats , climbed over the gunwales , or sank them with their hands
 having harried with fire and sword all whom he had ascertained to be against us , he began to take possession of armenia , when tigranes arrived , whom nero had selected to assume the sovereignty though a cappadocian noble and grandson of king archelaus , yet , from having long been a hostage at rome , he had sunk into servile submissiveness nor was he unanimously welcomed , as some still cherished a liking for the arsacids
 thus , by an apparently dutiful act , a scandalous scene was prevented
that day , slight skirmishes of cavalry having taken place near the river , both armies kept in their own positions : the gauls , because they were awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived ; caesar , if perchance by pretense of fear he could allure the enemy toward his position , so that he might engage in battle , in front of his camp , on this side of the valley ; if he could not accomplish this , that , having inquired about the passes , he might cross the valley and the river with the less hazard .
 he then reserved for his own consideration the question whether it became him to enter the senate
 the cavalry covered the flanks and the rear sido and italicus , the suevian chieftains , with a picked body of their countrymen , manoeuvred in the van
 but pompey having received information of the transactions at oricum and apollonia , began to be alarmed for dyrrachium , and endeavored to reach it , marching day and night . 
 they might determine as they pleased , and they had free liberty to acquit
 this proceeding strengthened the loyalty of the gauls
the climate is more temperate than in gaul , the colds being less severe .
 he must crawl out along the ground
 he also gave her a separate establishment , that throngs of visitors might no longer wait on her , and removed her to what had been antonia's house and whenever he went there himself , he was surrounded by a crowd of centurions , and used to leave her after a hurried kiss
 accordingly , when the advanced guard gave way , the legion which was stationed on that wing did not keep its ground , but retreated to the next hill . 
this he did , chiefly , on this account , because he was unwilling that the country , from which the helvetii had departed , should be untenanted , lest the germans , who dwell on the other side of the rhine , should , on account of the excellence of the lands , cross over from their own territories into those of the helvetii , and become borderers upon the province of gaul and the allobroges .
 the title of father of his country , which the people had so often thrust on him , tiberius refused , nor would he allow obedience to be sworn to his enactments , though the senate voted it , for he said repeatedly that all human things were uncertain , and that the more he had obtained , the more precarious was his position
 without the mother's knowledge , then in spite of her opposition , they had crept into his favour by debaucheries and equivocal secrets , and even the prince's older friends did not thwart him , for here was a girl who without harm to any one gratified his desires , when he loathed his wife octavia , high born as she was , and of approved virtue , either from some fatality , or because vice is overpoweringly attractive it was feared too that he might rush into outrages on noble ladies , were he debarred from this indulgence
 again , though their frames are terrible to the eye and formidable in a brief onset , they have no capacity of enduring wounds
 eastward the country is bounded by arabia to the south lies egypt on the west are phoenicia and the mediterranean northward it commands an extensive prospect over syria
 the calamity fell most fatally on the inhabitants of sardis , and it attracted to them the largest share of sympathy
 at the same time , he treated with them about capitulating , and promised them their lives if they would surrender . 
 it was generally believed that in the war with otho , as well as in the present , they had supported the cause of vitellius
 the flame of war would have spread through the province , but it was saved by quadratus , governor of syria
 otho , after publicly purifying the city and weighing various plans for the campaign , determined to march upon gallia narbonensis , as the passes of the penine and cottian alps and all the other approaches to gaul were held by the armies of vitellius his fleet was strong and loyal to his cause , for he had enrolled in the ranks of the legion the survivors of the slaughter at the milvian bridge , whom the stern policy of galba had retained in custody , while to the rest he had held out hopes of a more honourable service for the future
the consequence would be , that in a few years they would all be driven from the territories of gaul , and all the germans would cross the rhine ; for neither must the land of gaul be compared with the land of the germans , nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a level with that of the former .
 many believe that his fidelity had been shaken by the suggestions of flavius sabinus , who employed rubrius gallus as the bearer of communications intimating that the conditions of desertion would be held binding by vespasian
 and so the hostile threat recoiled on themselves
 you have at last found them , not because they have stood their ground , but because they have been overtaken
 fabius rusticus tells us that he did not return the way he came , but went out of his course to faenius , the commander of the guard , and having explained to him the emperor's orders , and asked whether he was to obey them , was by him admonished to carry them out , for a fatal spell of cowardice was on them all for this very silvanus was one of the conspirators , and he was now abetting the crimes which he had united with them to avenge
 nero's wife had been taken from him , and there had been the farce of consulting the pontiffs , whether , with a child conceived and not yet born , she could properly marry
although these things are so , yet , if hostages were to be given him by them in order that he may be assured these will do what they promise , and provided they will give satisfaction to the aedui for the outrages which they had committed against them and their allies , and likewise to the allobroges , he will make peace with them .
but those who were blockaded at alesia , the day being past , on which they had expected auxiliaries from their countrymen , and all their corn being consumed ignorant of what was going on among the aedui , convened an assembly and deliberated on the exigency of their situation .
 when seneca had fallen , it was easy to shake the position of faenius rufus by making agrippina's friendship a charge against him
 in the mean time ptolemy's younger daughter , hoping the throne would become vacant , made her escape from the palace to achillas , and assisted him in prosecuting the war . 
thither he proceeds with his legions : he finds the place admirably fortified by nature and art ; he , however , undertakes to attack it in two directions .
 both had also some german auxiliaries , and from this source vitellius , who was to follow with his whole military strength , completed his own forces
that also occurred to him , which was the consequence of a necessary work-that some soldiers who had gone off into the woods for the purpose of procuring timber and therewith constructing fortifications , were intercepted by the sudden arrival of horse .
 once these fields belonged to the chamavi
 he now began to urge vitellius to action
 what would happen were it for a number of years to be forgotten , just as in a divorce
 men began to speak of slaughtered armies , of captured encampments , of gaul in revolt , as if such things were not calamities
 their pity would be dangerous to him you certainly are an old man , and have had enough both of prosperity and of adversity , but think what a name , what a position , you will leave to your son germanicus
 he thought it a certainty that he had been chosen to govern syria in order to thwart the aspirations of germanicus
 on this , calpurnia that was the woman's name , as soon as she was allowed a private interview , threw herself at the emperor's knees , crying out that messalina was married to silius
 they sallied out against the other tower and agger , and fought with more confidence . 
 i miss the presence of an ex-consul in the senate , of a priest when we offer our vows , of a citizen when we swear obedience , unless indeed , in defiance of the manners and rites of our ancestors , thrasea has openly assumed the part of a traitor and an enemy
 even dismissal is not the end of our service , but , quartered under a legion's standard we toil through the same hardships under another title
 when afranius , who was in company with petreius , saw them at a distance , being affrighted at so unexpected a sight , he halted on a rising ground and drew up his army . 
 in raising the barrow caesar laid the first sod , rendering thus a most welcome honour to the dead , and sharing also in the sorrow of those present
 the light cohorts were thrown into confusion by the dense masses of the germans , when caesar rode up to the men of the twentieth legion , and in a loud voice exclaimed that this was the time for wiping out the mutiny
 about the same time further spain sent a deputation to the senate , with a request to be allowed , after the example of asia , to erect a temple to tiberius and his mother
 though our fortune and courage have for the moment failed us , have we so utterly forgotten the old memories of those many times when the legions of rome resolved to perish but not to be driven from their post
 thus they roll about amid the billows , and , as they have a prow at both extremities alike and a convertible arrangement of oars , they may be paddled in one direction or another indifferently and without risk
 we must die , if we capitulate all that concerns us is this
having marshalled his army in three lines , and in a short time performed a march of eight miles , he arrived at the camp of the enemy before the germans could perceive what was going on ; who being suddenly alarmed by all the circumstances , both by the speediness of our arrival and the absence of their own officers , as time was afforded neither for concerting measures nor for seizing their arms , are perplexed as to whether it would be better to lead out their forces against the enemy , or to defend their camp , or seek their safety by flight .
caesar granted those whom he had detained in the camp liberty of departing .
he ordered quintus titurius sabinus and lucius aurunculeius cotta , his legates , to take command of these soldiers .
 junius otho's old employment had been the keeping of a preparatory school
indutiomarus was very much offended at this act , his influence was diminished among his countrymen ; and he , who already before had borne a hostile mind toward us , was much more violently inflamed against us through resentment at this .
 about the same time caius curio , having sailed from sicily to africa , and from the first despising the forces of publius attius varus , transported only two of the four legions which he had received from caesar , and five hundred horse , and having spent two days and three nights on the voyage , arrived at a place called aquilaria , which is about twenty-two miles distant from clupea , and in the summer season has a convenient harbor , and is inclosed by two projecting promontories . 
 it is by the blood of the provinces that the provinces are conquered
 no one knew this better than nero , who had oftener experienced seneca's freespokenness than his servility
 but the horse , fatigued by the expedition of the preceding night , were not able to keep up with him , but fell behind in different places . 
 if these are divulged by slaves , we may live singly amid numbers , safe among a trembling throng lastly , if we must perish , it will be with vengeance on the guilty
 such , senators , are the anxieties which the prince has to sustain , and the neglect of them will be utter ruin to the state
 scipio with the syrian legions commanded the center . 
 many companies for the collection of the indirect taxes had been formed by consuls and tribunes , when the freedom of the roman people was still in its vigour , and arrangements were subsequently made to insure an exact correspondence between the amount of income and the necessary disbursements
 subsequently the emperor , as a rumour was gaining ground that he was on the point of a reconciliation with his daughter-in-law and his grandson , chose to be merciless rather than to relent
 nevertheless secret emissaries were dispatched by otho to germany , and by vitellius to rome
 the image of the goddess does not bear the human shape it is a rounded mass rising like a cone from a broad base to a small circumference
my business is with those who approve of a sally : in whose advice the memory of our ancient prowess seems to dwell in the opinion of you all .
 the place of her confinement was the colony of antium , where the emperor himself was born
 domitius's design being noised abroad , the soldiers in corfinium early in the evening began to mutiny , and held a conference with each other by their tribunes and centurions , and the most respectable among themselves : that they were besieged by caesar ; that his works and fortifications were almost finished ; that their general , domitius , on whose hopes and expectations they had confided , had thrown them off , and was meditating his own escape ; that they ought to provide for their own safety . 
the work having been begun , a cavalry action ensues in that plain , which we have already described as broken by hills , and extending three miles in length .
 but all human efforts , all the lavish gifts of the emperor , and the propitiations of the gods , did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order
 clandestine correspondence is equally unknown to men and women
 these he fastened with four anchors at the four corners , that they might not be carried away by the waves . 
 yet the age was not so barren in noble qualities , as not also to exhibit examples of virtue
 for agricola was still the governor of britain accordingly the emperor ordered that the usual triumphal decorations , the honour of a laurelled statue , and all that is commonly given in place of the triumphal procession , with the addition of many laudatory expressions , should be decreed in the senate , together with a hint to the effect that agricola was to have the province of syria , then vacant by the death of atilius rufus , a man of consular rank , and generally reserved for men of distinction
having left this interval , he drew two trenches fifteen feet broad , and of the same depth ; the innermost of them , being in low and level ground , he filled with water conveyed from the river .
 the emperor had only a few estates in italy , slaves on a moderate scale , and his household was confined to a few freedmen if ever he had a dispute with a private person , it was decided in the law courts
 either the entreaties of the colonies , or the difficulty of the work or superstitious motives prevailed , and they yielded to piso's opinion , who declared himself against any change
 elderly men who amuse their leisure with comparing the past and the present , observed that nero was the first emperor who needed another man's eloquence
 caecina he stigmatized as a captive and a prisoner of war
 of this they became sensible , as well from the reproaches of others , as from the judgment of their own minds , and a consciousness of guilt . 
 his language about himself was modest he shewed no change in look or manner
 the praise of his graceful accomplishments , and the remark that during his reign no disaster had befallen rome from the foreigner , were heard with favour
 by these means it was brought to pass that a thousand of his horse would dare even on open ground , to stand against seven thousand of pompey's , if occasion required , and would not be much terrified by their number . 
 the dwellers on the river-bank also buy wine
 it is thy spirit , divine augustus , now received into heaven , thine image , father drusus , and the remembrance of thee , which , with these same soldiers who are now stimulated by shame and ambition , should wipe out this blot and turn the wrath of civil strife to the destruction of the foe
 nero was for the future more timid , and surrounded himself with soldiers and a number of gladiators , who , when a fray began on a small scale and seemed a private affair , were to let it alone , but , if the injured persons resisted stoutly , they rushed in with their swords
 but in such gigantic preparations for war there is usually delay
 at this time the country was hearing with anything but sorrow rumours that daily gained strength of disasters in germany
if he for his part did not dictate to the roman people as to the manner in which they were to exercise their right , he ought not to be obstructed by the roman people in his right ; that the aedui , inasmuch as they had tried the fortune of war and had engaged in arms and been conquered , had become tributaries to him ; that caesar was doing a great injustice , in that by his arrival he was making his revenues less valuable to him ; that he should not restore their hostages to the aedui , but should not make war wrongfully either upon them or their allies , if they abided by that which had been agreed on , and paid their tribute annually : if they did not continue to do that , the roman people's name of 'brothers' would avail them naught .
 unawed by the punishment of their comrades , and unmoved by their contrition , they still retained their resentment
 i record the fact with a special object whoever would study the calamities of that period in my pages or those of other authors , is to take it for granted that as often as the emperor directed banishments or executions , so often was there a thanksgiving to the gods , and what formerly commemorated some prosperous event , was then a token of public disaster
 but when they were acquainted with caesar's demands , they would transmit them to pompey , who would conclude all of himself by their persuasions . 
 why then in old times was economy in the ascendant
 therefore the transverse rampart which should make a communication between the other two , was not yet completed . 
 titus livius , pre-eminently famous for eloquence and truthfulness , extolled cneius pompeius in such a panegyric that augustus called him pompeianus , and yet this was no obstacle to their friendship
 only let proculus gird himself to do his part and bring over to their side his bravest soldiers , and then look for an adequate recompense
 at last , doubting what they should avoid or whither betake themselves , they crowded the streets or flung themselves down in the fields , while some who had lost their all , even their very daily bread , and others out of love for their kinsfolk , whom they had been unable to rescue , perished , though escape was open to them
 pompey , being informed of these proceedings , laid aside his design of going to syria , and having taken the public money from the farmers of the revenue , and borrowed more from some private friends , and having put on board his ships a large quantity of brass for military purposes , and two thousand armed men , whom he partly selected from the slaves of the tax farmers , and partly collected from the merchants , and such persons as each of his friends thought fit on this occasion , he sailed for pelusium . 
 anicetus also set fire to the fleet , and , as the sea was not guarded , escaped , for mucianus had brought up to byzantium the best of the liburnian ships and all the troops
 far less , in rome's most glorious height of power , should a robber like tacfarinas be bought off by peace and concessions of territory
caesar , having divided his forces with c fabius , his lieutenant , and m crassus his questor , and having hastily constructed some bridges , enters their country in three divisions , burns their houses and villages , and gets possession of a large number of cattle and men .
 everything else will follow the issue of that struggle
 between judaea and syria is mount carmel
 vitellius himself failed not to draw out their sympathies by his pitiable looks , his voice , and his tears
 many think the genius of the soldier wants subtlety , because military law , which is summary and blunt , and apt to appeal to the sword , finds no exercise for the refinements of the forum
 they threw everything into an uproar with their clamorous shouts of joy , careless of the truth , and only eager to flatter
 we have heard from our fathers , we have ourselves seen that married women were seized at the caprice of the caesars
 a rumour had also gone forth that the chiefs of gaul , whom otho had sent against vitellius , had , before their departure , bound themselves by a compact not to fall the cause of freedom , should the power of rome be broken by a continuous succession of civil wars and internal calamities
 it was , in fact , not so much popularity in the present for which he cared as for glory in the future
and i would approve of this opinion , could i foresee no other loss , save that of life ; but let us , in adopting our design , look back on all gaul , which we have stirred up to our aid .
 while skirmishes were fought in this manner , they advanced but slowly and gradually , and frequently halted to help their rear , as then happened . 
 meanwhile the tidings of the death of vitellius , spreading through gaul and germany , had caused a second war
 in the consulship of caius antistius and marcus suilius , the adoption of domitius was hastened on by the influence of pallas bound to agrippina , first as the promoter of her marriage , then as her paramour , he still urged claudius to think of the interests of the state , and to provide some support for the tender years of britannicus so , he said , it had been with the divine augustus , whose stepsons , though he had grandsons to be his stay , had been promoted
 valens and caecina he put by his own chair of state , after celebrating their praises before a general assembly
 while these things were going forward in spain , caius trebonius , caesar's lieutenant , who had been left to conduct the assault of massilia , began to raise a mound , vineae , and turrets against the town , on two sides ; one of which was next the harbor and docks , the other on that part where there is a passage from gaul and spain to that sea which forces itself up the mouth of the rhone . 
 verona seemed the most eligible , surrounded as it was with open plains , suitable for the action of cavalry , in which they were very strong
 such a treaty is thought to have a mysterious sanctity , as being sealed with the blood of both parties
 , in a sudden frenzy they rushed with drawn swords on the centurions , the immemorial object of the soldiers' resentment and the first cause of savage fury
 accordingly the emperor issued an edict that the regulations about every branch of the public revenue , which had hitherto been kept secret , should be published
but that , if no one else should follow , yet he would go with only the tenth legion , of which he had no misgivings , and it should be his praetorian cohort .
 the same compliment was not paid to trebellius maximus
 bibulus , being prevented from landing for several days , and being seized with a violent distemper from the cold and fatigue , as he could neither be cured on board , nor was willing to desert the charge which he had taken upon him , was unable to bear up against the violence of the disease . 
 as for you , the exile of your father , and the division of his property among his creditors , had left you perfectly safe , besides that your youth incapacitated you for office there was nothing in you which nero could either covet or dread it was from sheer lust of slaughter and greed of gain that you , unknown as you were , you , who had never pleaded in any man's defence , steeped your soul in noble blood , when , though you had snatched from the very grave of your country the spoils of a man of consular rank , had been fed to the full with seven million sesterces , and shone with all sacerdotal honours , you yet overwhelmed in one common ruin innocent boys , old men of illustrious name , and noble ladies , when you actually blamed the tardy movements of nero in wearying himself and his informers with the overthrow of single families , and declared that the whole senate might be destroyed by one word
 from narnia , to avoid suspicion or because the plans of fear are uncertain , he sailed down the nar , then down the tiber , and increased the fury of the populace by bringing his vessel to shore at the tomb of the caesars in broad daylight , when the river-bank was thronged , he himself with a numerous following of dependents , and plancina with a retinue of women , moved onward with joy in their countenances
 but on this road there is a spring , to which the sea comes up , and overflows ; an extensive morass is thereby formed ; and if a person would avoid it , he must make a circuit of six miles to reach the town . 
he sets spies over dumnorix that he may be able to know what he does , and with whom he communicates .
nor did any period of the whole winter pass over without fresh anxiety to caesar , or , without his receiving some intelligence respecting the meetings and commotions of the gauls .
 sabinus , over and above his natural vanity , was inflamed with the pride of an imaginary descent , for he asserted that his great-grandmother had , by her personal charms , attracted the admiration of the divine julius , when he was campaigning in gaul these two men held secret conferences to sound the views of the rest of their countrymen , and when they had secured as accomplices such as they thought suitable for their purpose , they met together in a private house in the colonia agrippinensis
 shall we set about storming the town when we have no means seeing where the ground is level , what is the height of the walls , whether the city is to be assailed by our artillery and javelins , or by siege-works and covered approaches
 a compact , so to say , ought to be sealed between them , by which he should retain his province , and the emperor be master of all else
 a partiality long felt in britain for vespasian , who had there commanded the 2nd legion by the appointment of claudius , and had served with distinction , attached that province to his cause , though not without some commotion among the other legions , in which were many centurions and soldiers promoted by vitellius , who felt uneasy in exchanging for another ruler one whom they knew already
the enemy , when they perceived that their hopes had deceived them both with regard to their taking the town by storm and also their passing the river , and did not see our men advance to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting , and when provisions began to fail them , having called a council , determined that it was best for each to return to his country , and resolved to assemble from all quarters to defend those into whose territories the romans should first march an army ; that they might contend in their own rather than in a foreign country , and might enjoy the stores of provision which they possessed at home .
 henceforward as a counsel for the defence or the prosecution he enjoyed the fame of eloquence rather than of virtue , but old age robbed him of much of his speaking power , while , with a failing intellect , he was still impatient of silence
 it was not from any apprehension that vitellius kept cluvius with him
that fact caesar had learned from his own personal friends .
 arminius having bidden his men to concentrate themselves and keep close to the woods , suddenly wheeled round , and soon gave those whom he had concealed in the forest passes the signal to rush to the attack
 he further adds , that whatever any of them lost in the war , which was in the possession of his soldiers , should be restored to those that lost them . 
for , on one side , the bellovaci , a state which held the highest reputation for prowess in gaul , were pressing on him ; and camulogenus , with a disciplined and well-equipped army , held the other side ; moreover , a very great river separated and cut off the legions from the garrison and baggage .
 if each common soldier were to have bestowed on him by the emperor's hand the special honour of a crown for a rescued citizen , how wonderfully great the glory , when the numbers would be equal of those who had brought and of those had received deliverance roused by these and like words into a common enthusiasm , and some too were filled with an ardour peculiarly their own by the perils of brothers and kinsfolk , they hurried on by day and night their uninterrupted march
 having killed a centurion and some soldiers , who , to impart military discipline , had been incorporated with their ranks and were employed at once to instruct and command them , they embarked on board three swift galleys with pilots pressed into their service
 there lingered even then a few signs of expiring freedom
 the country which we inhabit , they said to themselves , is an island 
 the altered times soon restored him to liberty
 but live , and let us no longer delay , lest i interfere with your safety , you with my firmness
 that , as soon as his mind had recovered from its grief , he would lay their demands before the senators
 availing themselves of the sordid policy of the claudian era to purchase the right of fortification , they raised in time of peace such walls as were suited for war
 thus grown famous in the capital , and with a renown widely spread through the provinces , he was planning a journey to the armies of germany born at vienna , and supported by numerous and powerful connections , he would find it easy to rouse nations allied to his house
 this affair being concluded , having retained only two legions in his camp , he marched the rest of his army out at three o'clock in the morning by several gates , and sent them forward by the same route ; and in a short space after , that the military practice might be preserved , and his march known as late as possible , he ordered the signal for decamping to be given ; and setting out immediately and following the rear of his own army , he was soon out of sight of the camp . 
 crassus it would be a distinction to you to add to the nobility of your race the honours of the sulpician and lutatian houses as it is , i , who have been called to the throne by the unanimous consent of gods and men , am moved by your splendid endowments and by my own patriotism to offer to you , a man of peace , that power , for which our ancestors fought , and which i myself obtained by war
 such was this city and nation
 never was rome more distracted and terror-stricken
 it was a glorious victory the wife and daughter of caractacus were captured , and his brothers too were admitted to surrender
 there can be no secret about what is to follow such a marriage
 lastly , nothing can happen to us more terrible than that upon which we are voluntarily rushing
 more to be pitied were they who with limbs torn from them still retained life , while they recognised their wives and children by seeing them during the day and by hearing in the night their screams and groans
 pompeius's theatre , which had been destroyed by an accidental fire , the emperor promised to rebuild , simply because no member of the family was equal to restoring it , but pompeius's name was to be retained
 it is the fault of envious human nature that the old is always the object of praise , the present of contempt
 alpinius montanus , prefect of a cohort in the vanquished army , was on the spot , and acknowledged the fate of his party
 this poppaea had everything but a right mind
 at the same time he sent the sutlers and camp-followers with the freshest of the cavalry to bedriacum to fetch supplies and whatever else they needed
 domitius balbus , an ex-praetor , from his prolonged old age , his childlessness and his wealth , was exposed to many a plot
 lucius domitius , fleeing from the camp to the mountains , his strength being exhausted by fatigue , was killed by the horse . 
 the position was commanded by decrius , a soldier energetic in action and experienced in war , who regarded the siege as a disgrace
 all throughout , claudius preserved a strange silence
 on his return from rhodes he ruled the emperor's now heirless house for twelve years , and the roman world , with absolute sway , for about twenty-three
 these he first of all occupied with guards , and raised strong forts on them . 
 nor did claudius , when he spoke with preparation , lack elegance
 out of this , clothing , arms , tents , as well as the mercy of centurions and exemptions from duty have to be purchased
 within the three days the eighth legion came to him , and twenty-two cohorts of the new levies in gaul , and about three hundred horse from the king of noricum . 
 cassius was at that time pre-eminent for legal learning
 where they could not be accused of grasping at political power , their tears were made a crime
 this letter latinius pandus , propraetor of moesia , sent to thrace , with soldiers to whose custody cotys was to be delivered
 he gave orders that all persons should be excluded from the temple
 the rest of the tribunes and centurions preferred immediate safety to danger and duty such was the temper of men's minds , that , while there were few to venture on so atrocious a treason , many wished it done , and all were ready to acquiesce
 the rest sheltered themselves in concealment , and one only was detained , clemens julius , whom the soldiers considered a fit person to carry messages , from his ready wit

 civilis was put in chains and sent to nero , and , though acquitted by galba , again stood in peril of his life in the time of vitellius , when the army clamoured for his execution
 hence arose a frightful rumour , many asserting that the envoys had been killed , and that , unless the soldiers provided their own safety , the next thing would be , that the most energetic of their number , and those who had complained of their present condition , would be slaughtered under cover of night , when the rest of the army would know nothing of their fate the legions then bound themselves by a secret agreement into this the auxiliary troops were admitted at first objects of suspicion , from the idea that their infantry and cavalry were being concentrated in preparation for an attack on the legions , these troops soon became especially zealous in the scheme
 upon this not only did the people and the ignorant rabble break out into applause and vehement expressions of zeal , but many of the knights and senators , losing their caution as they laid aside their fear , burst open the doors of the palace , rushed in , and displayed themselves to galba , complaining that their revenge had been snatched from them the most arrant coward , the man , who , as the event proved , would dare nothing in the moment of danger , was the most voluble and fierce of speech

 a few were buried by their friends the multitude that remained were left above ground
 lucilius bassus , who had been promoted by vitellius from the command of a squadron of cavalry to be admiral of the fleets at ravenna and misenum , failing immediately to obtain the command of the praetorian guard sought to gratify his unreasonable resentment by an atrocious act of perfidy it cannot be certainly known whether he carried caecina with him , or whether as is often the case with bad men , that they are like each other both were actuated by the same evil motives

 there , it is not a woman , as at delphi , but a priest chosen from certain families , generally from miletus , who ascertains simply the number and the names of the applicants
our soldiers , after the alarm of so great a war , for the number of the enemy amounted to 430 , 000 , returned to their camp , all safe to a man , very few being even wounded .
 tiberius was not unaware of the formidable difficulty of the inquiry and of the rumours by which he was himself assailed
 piso made his way to the temple of vesta , where he was admitted by the compassion of one of the public slaves , who concealed him in his chamber there , not indeed through the sanctity of the place or its worship , but through the obscurity of his hiding-place , he obtained a respite from instant destruction , till there came , by otho's direction and specially eager to slay him , sulpicius florus , of the british auxiliary infantry , to whom galba had lately given the citizenship , and statius murcus , one of the body-guard piso was dragged out by these men and slaughtered in the entrance of the temple
on learning these facts , he set out from the camp secretly at midnight , and reached the camp of the enemy early in the morning .
 the head of the murdered man was brought to rome
 by the prosperity and order of eight hundred years has this fabric of empire been consolidated , nor can it be overthrown without destroying those who overthrow it
 i do not single out any of the common herd , as canutius , or arrius , and others in the same sick-room , so to say , who are content with mere skin and bones
 yours will be the worst peril , for you have gold and wealth , and these are the chief incentives to war
 not however to seem to throw off all their reverence for the empire , they sought to dignify their oath with the now obsolete names of the senate and people of rome not a single legate or tribune exerted himself for galba some , as is usual in a tumult , were even conspicuously active in mutiny , though no one delivered anything like a formal harangue or spoke from a tribunal
 one speech was heard from him shewing a spirit not utterly degraded , when to the insults of a tribune he answered , yet i was your emperor
 the spoil indeed had been rendered valueless to the soldiers by a general agreement throughout italy , which rejected with loathing the purchase of such slaves
 how often had the divine augustus travelled to west and to the east accompanied by livia
 there was his mother too with a woman caprice
 in addition , the river nicephorius , the breadth of which is far from contemptible , circled a portion of its walls , and a wide fosse was drawn where they distrusted the protection of the stream
 when she spurned him , he asked the solace of one night , with which to soothe his passion , that he might set bounds to it for the future
 the miserable have more fury and greater resolution
 never indeed may heaven suffer the belgae , though they proffer their aid , to have the glory and honour of having rescued the name of rome and quelled the tribes of germany
 besides the states already mentioned , the consuls reported that they had ascertained that at pergamus there was a sanctuary of aesculapius , but that the rest relied on an origin lost in the obscurity of antiquity
 to speak of uprightness and purity in such a man would be an insult to his virtues
 should the germans and the gauls lead you to the walls of the capital , will you lift up arms against your country
 ampius flavianus , not from any proof of his guilt , but because he had been long unpopular , they clamoured for his death in a very whirlwind of passion , vociferating that he was the kinsman of vitellius , that he had betrayed otho , that he had embezzled the donative
 a great change is shortly made in the face of affairs . 
 with vologeses it was an old and deep conviction that he should shun the arms of rome
 on the right front stood the first legion with two cohorts of auxiliaries and 500 cavalry
 but he spared himself the anguish of a word or of a look , and merely sent in to seneca one of his centurions , who was to announce to him his last doom
 winter was now approaching , and octavius , despairing of capturing the town , after sustaining such considerable losses , withdrew to pompey , to dyrrachium . 
 not a moment passed in which their rear was not engaged with our horse . 
 the master requires from the slave a certain quantity of grain , of cattle , and of clothing , as he would from a tenant , and this is the limit of subjection
 the prince was not ignorant of the slanders with which he had been assailed , but his good nature was such that when a storm arose and drove piso on rocks , and his enemy's destruction could have been referred to chance , he sent some triremes , by the help of which he might be rescued from danger
 narbon gaul , for its special reverence of the senate , received a privilege senators belonging to the province , without seeking the emperor's approval , were to be allowed to visit their estates , a right enjoyed by sicily
 nevertheless the statues of vitellius were again set up in the camp and in the neighbouring belgian towns , and this at a time when vitellius himself had fallen
 this man had actually imbued his hands in the blood of capito consequently he was to those who cried for vengeance a more notorious criminal , and to him who punished a cheaper sacrifice
 the senate approved of sending deputies , but none could be found fit to execute the commission : for every person , from his own private fears , declined the office . 
 there was a debate in the council between afranius and petreius , and the time of marching was the subject . 
for five successive days from that day , caesar drew out his forces before the camp , and put them in battle order , that , if ariovistus should be willing to engage in battle , an opportunity might not be wanting to him .
 though formerly he had been assiduous and unwearied in showing himself a supporter or an opponent even of the most ordinary motions of senators , he had not entered the senate-house for three years , and very lately , when all were rushing thither with rival eagerness to put down silanus and vetus , he had attended by preference to the private business of his clients
 the fall of his father-in-law drove him into exile , but he returned when galba mounted the throne , and proceeded to impeach marcellus eprius , who had been the informer against thrasea
their consternation being made apparent by their noise and tumult , our soldiers , excited by the treachery of the preceding day , rushed into the camp : such of them as could readily get their arms , for a short time withstood our men , and gave battle among their carts and baggage wagons ; but the rest of the people , of boys and women began to fly in all directions ; in pursuit of whom caesar sent the cavalry .
 it is productive of grain , but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees
 it was indeed widely rumoured that the notorius poisoner martina , who , as i have related , had been despatched to rome by cneius sentius , had died suddenly at brundisium that poison was concealed in a knot of her hair , and that no symptoms of suicide were discovered on her person
 of this nero became aware , and he ordered the departure of the military guard now kept for the emperor's mother , as it had formerly been for the imperial consort , along with some german troops , added as a further honour
 as no progress was made towards a final settlement of peace by the interchange of messages , it was at last decided to fix a time and a place for an interview between the leaders
 triumphal arches were erected at rome , on the banks of the rhine , and on mount amanus in syria , with an inscription recording his achievements , and how he had died in the public service
 no one knew anything , yet all were confident in assertion , till at length galba in the dearth of all true intelligence , and overborne by the universal delusion , assumed his cuirass , and as , from age and bodily weakness , he could not stand up against the crowd that was still rushing in , he was elevated on a chair he was met in the palace by julius atticus , a soldier of the body-guard , who , displaying a bloody sword , cried i have slain otho
 it was , they said , a mutiny of only a single legion
 though he confided in the valour of his men , he yet mingled encouragements and entreaties to disdain the clamours and empty threats of the barbarians
having provided every thing for the expedition , they appoint a day , on which they should all meet on the bank of the rhone .
 still i would not hinder the accused from producing all the evidence which can relieve his innocence or convict germanicus of any unfairness , if such there was and i implore you not to take as proven charges alleged , merely because the case is intimately bound up with my affliction
 a few senators who had espoused that party , made their escape by night . 
 never at any time was the shock of battle more tremendous or the issue more doubtful , as the right wings of both armies were routed
 when his scouts reported that the king had undertaken a long march , and that it was doubtful whether media or albania was its destination , he waited for daylight , and then sent on his light-armed troops , which were meanwhile to hover round the walls and begin the attack from a distance
 on the other hand julius auspex , one of the leading chieftains among the remi , dwelt on the power of rome and the advantages of peace pointing out that war might be commenced indeed by cowards , but must be carried on at the peril of the braver spirits , and that the roman legions were close at hand , he restrained the most prudent by considerations of respect and loyalty , and held back the younger by representations of danger and appeals to fear
 having completed and secured them , he then joined to them other floats of equal size . 
 in these same councils they also elect the chief magistrates , who administer law in the cantons and the towns
 galba's policy and the diminution of their tribute have inspired them with hostile feelings
 the year when caius asinius and caius antistius were consuls was the ninth of tiberius's reign , a period of tranquillity for the state and prosperity for his own house , for he counted germanicus's death a happy incident suddenly fortune deranged everything the emperor became a cruel tyrant , as well as an abettor of cruelty in others
 he received the news with extravagant joy , slew victims , visited the temples , with no moderation in his transports while plancina's insolence increased , and she then for the first time exchanged for the gayest attire the mourning she had worn for her lost sister
 private affairs are neglected , in order that a man may devote himself to the business of others
then , having divided his forces into three parts , he sent the baggage of all the legions to aduatuca .
 soon after , as he was leaving with drusus to betake himself in foresight of his danger to the winter camp , they surrounded him , and asked him again and again whither he was going was it to the emperor or to the senate , there also to oppose the interests of the legions
 to it they retreated , and from it they made defense if any superior force attacked them ; and from it they sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy . 
 ashamed of the atrocious deed , and aware of the detestation which it was inspiring , antonius issued a proclamation , that no one should detain in captivity a citizen of cremona
 he collected a force of veterans and a small body of auxiliaries then as the ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain , he put himself in front of the ranks to inspire all with the same courage against a common danger , and led his troops up a hill
 on the other , the distinctions of the soldiery of the capital and the praetorian cohorts
 otho's generals had long since fled and caecina and valens strengthened their army with the reserves
 thereupon paetus dwelt on the memories of the luculli and pompeii , and of all that the caesars had done in the way of holding or giving away armenia , while vasaces declared that we had the mere shadow of possession and of bestowing , but the parthians , the reality of power
he sends before him gaius volusenus with a ship of war , to acquire a knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a descent into the island , as he was convinced that this was a judicious measure .
 those veteran troops victorious in so many campaigns , now that the enemy is in sight , are withdrawn , so to speak , from the very field of battle
 the batavians , he said , though free of tribute , have yet taken up arms against our common masters
this opinion having been approved of by unanimous consent , more than twenty towns of the bituriges are burned in one day .
 nor were there the means of escape usual in , such a disaster , by rushing out into the open country , for there people were swallowed up by the yawning earth
 while they were fortifying a camp at ticinum , the news of caecina's defeat reached them , and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh from an impression that underhand dealing and delay on the part of valens had kept them away from the battle
 he came from the municipal town of ferentinum
 civilis was seized by a desire to make a naval demonstration
 civilis stands in arms against us , and arranges the order of his battle
 catus , as i have related , had drawn libo into a snare and then destroyed him by an information
as to his leading over a host of germans into gaul , that he was doing this with a view of securing himself , not of assaulting gaul : that there was evidence of this , in that he did not come without being invited , and in that he did not make war , but merely warded it off .
 messalina meanwhile , in the gardens of lucullus , was struggling for life , and writing letters of entreaty , as she alternated between hope arid fury
they do not regard it lawful to eat the hare , and the cock , and the goose ; they , however , breed them for amusement and pleasure .
 wherever a shout was heard , they wheeled round and strained hand and foot
 those who were strangers to him , and who , because they were at enmity with others , made the emperor their heir , he kept at a distance
 caesar with some praetorian cohorts was the first , after the storming of the ramparts , to dash into the woods
 it was there that the greatest slaughter took place
 and yet , marriages and the rearing of children did not become more frequent , so powerful were the attractions of a childless state
 civilis was anxious to follow up his success
 about the same time lucius piso , the pontiff , died a natural death , a rare incident in so high a rank never had he by choice proposed a servile motion , and , whenever necessity was too strong for him , he would suggest judicious compromises
 who but the guilty or unfortunate apply to us
 the soldiers of the ninth legion suddenly closing their files , threw their javelins , and advancing impetuously from the low ground up the steep , drove pompey's men precipitately before them , and obliged them to turn their backs ; but their retreat was greatly impeded by the hurdles that lay in a long line before them , and the palisadoes which were in their way , and the trenches that were sunk . 
 something however of popular favour was bequeathed to him from the remembrance of germanicus , whose only male descendant he was , and the pity felt for his mother agrippina was increased by the cruelty of messalina , who , always her enemy , and then more furious than ever , was only kept from planning an accusation and suborning informers by a new and almost insane passion
 hence arose hopes built on our disasters civilis , however , was naturally politic to a degree rarely found among barbarians he was wont to represent himself as sertorius or hannibal , on the strength of a similar disfigurement of his countenance to avoid the opposition which he would encounter as a public enemy , were he openly to revolt from rome , he affected a friendship for vespasian and a zealous attachment to his party and indeed a letter had been despatched to him by primus antonius , in which he was directed to divert the reinforcements which vitellius had called up , and to keep the legions where they were by the feint of an outbreak in germany the same policy was suggested by hordeonius in person he had a bias towards vespasian , and feared for the empire , the utter ruin of which would be very near , were a fresh war with so many thousands of armed men to burst upon italy
 lutorius's life is still safe if spared , he will be no danger to the state
but it was effected owing to this circumstance , that his house being surrounded by a wood , his attendants and friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time the attack of our horse .
 it was during the same period that the chauci , free , as it happened , from dissension at home and emboldened by the death of sanquinius , made , while corbulo was on his way , an inroad into lower germany , under the leadership of gannascus this man was of the tribe of the canninefates , had served long as our auxiliary , had then deserted , and , getting some light vessels , had made piratical descents specially on the coast of gaul , inhabited , he knew , by a wealthy and unwarlike population
and since they could less easily perform every thing by themselves , and provide what was to be done in each place , by reason of the length of the line of march , they ordered to give the command that they should leave the baggage and form themselves into an orb , which measure , though in a contingency of that nature it was not to be condemned , still turned out unfortunately ; for it both diminished the hope of our soldiers and rendered the enemy more eager for the fight , because it appeared that this was not done without the greatest fear and despair .
 bassus , moved by shame , or perhaps by fear , awaited the issue in his house
 as a former age had witnessed the extreme of liberty , so we witnessed the extreme of servitude , when the informer robbed us of the interchange of speech and hearing
 as to the duties on corn , the indirect taxes and other branches of the public revenue , they were in the hands of companies of roman knights
 these , in fact , had been the first to begin the mutiny , and the most atrocious deeds had been committed by their hands
 after this all prayers were addressed to tiberius
 assuredly what is despised is soon forgotten
meanwhile , with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers which had assembled from the province , he carries along for nineteen miles a wall , to the height of sixteen feet , and a trench , from the lake of geneva , which flows into the river rhone , to mount jura , which separates the territories of the sequani from those of the helvetii .
 on that side the germans threw the weight of their attack
 they persisted and he , though on the one hand he feared the scandal of a fruitless attempt , yet , on the other , was induced by the entreaties of the men and by the language of his flatterers to hope for success
 for my self , as virgil says , let the sweet muses lead me to their sacred retreats , and to their fountains far away from anxieties and cares , and the necessity of doing every day something repugnant to my heart
 it happened that the trial at this time of votienus montanus , a popular wit , convinced the hesitating tiberius that he ought to shun all assemblies of the senate , where speeches , often true and offensive , were flung in his very face
 not far from this lake lies a plain , once fertile , they say , and the site of great cities , but afterwards struck by lightning and consumed
 that same day was fatal also to pompeius aelianus , a young ex-quaestor , suspected of complicity in the villanies of fabianus he was outlawed from italy , and from spain , where he was born
 the bridge being finished , five powerful states being joined to caesar , a way opened for the receiving of corn , and the rumors of the assistance of legions which were said to be on their march , with pompey at their head , through mauritania , having died away , several of the more distant states revolt from afranius , and enter into league with caesar . 
 in front of the throng stood the legions with drawn swords
 in the mean time , publius sylla , whom caesar at his departure had left governor of his camp , came up with two legions to assist the cohort ; upon whose arrival pompey's forces were easily repulsed . 
 as , however , he did not venture to make a beginning at rome , he chose neapolis , because it was a greek city
 everywhere there lay scattered arms , corpses , and mangled limbs , and the earth reeked with blood
 formerly rich or highly distinguished noble families often sank into ruin from a passion for splendour
 two illustrious men died that year one was asinius saloninus , distinguished as the grandson of marcus agrippa , and asinius pollio , as the brother of drusus and the intended husband of the emperor's granddaughter the other was capito ateius , already mentioned , who had won a foremost position in the state by his legal attainments , though his grandfather was but a centurion in sulla's army , his father having been a praetor
 the greater part , as they were scattered in flight the rest made their escape to the camp , while civilis certainly complained of the proceeding , and upbraided the germans with breaking faith by this atrocious act
 the same range supplies and sends forth the stream of the jordan this river does not discharge itself into the sea , but flows entire through two lakes , and is lost in the third
 nor did otho repulse the advances of individuals , while he checked the greed and ferocity of the soldiers by word and look
 on the emperor and his son titus the consulship was bestowed by decree
 the cure for other evils must be sought in our own hearts
 the consul rejecting it , and those who were standing by in the assembly shouting remontrance , he departed , as if with the intention of laying aside the emblems of imperial power in the temple of concord , and of betaking himself to his brother's house
 it was rumoured meanwhile throughout italy , and was believed at rome , that agrippa had been saved by the blessing of heaven
 though in itself a small gain , for the town is but of moderate strength , it was considered an important advantage when they reflected that in this town caecina was born , and that the general of the enemy had lost his native place
 to you , nero and drusus , these senators are as fathers
 when once the way had been entered , zealous adherents were forthcoming
 he had also carried an intrenchment from the left angle of the camp to the river , about four hundred paces , that his soldiers might have more liberty and less danger in fetching water . 
 yet as many as four thousand human beings were slaughtered
caius antistius reginus , and caius caninius rebilus , two of the lieutenants , with two legions , were in possession of this camp .
he easily gains over the nervii by this speech .
 the beginning of the emperor's letter seemed very striking
 they tell it one to another , and often mention it in letters to their colonies and provinces , whether it is a reflection lighted up by a neat and pithy phrase , or a passage bright with choice and poetic ornament
 i need neither revenge nor consolation
 plancius varus , who had filled the office of praetor , and had been one of dolabella's intimate friends , founded on this a charge , which he laid before flavius sabinus , prefect of the city , implying that dolabella had escaped from custody , and had offered to put himself at the head of the vanquished party
 the senate voted sejanus a statue , which was to be placed in pompeius's theatre
 against you indeed no hostile ranks are gathering
 many whom they slew were unarmed or in the act of arming themselves , some were just awaking from sleep , amid the confusion of darkness and panic , the braying of trumpets , and the shouts of the foe
 but augustus looked for a successor in his own family , i look for one in the state , not because i have no relatives or companions of my campaigns , but because it was not by any private favour that i myself received the imperial power
 bold before the danger came and timid in the moment of peril , the helvetii , though at the commencement of the movement they had chosen claudius severus for their leader , knew not how to use their arms , to keep their ranks , or to act in concert
in the mean time , the trinobantes , almost the most powerful state of those parts , from which the young man , mandubracius embracing the protection of caesar had come to the continent of gaul to him , send embassadors to caesar , and promise that they will surrender themselves to him and perform his commands ; they entreat him to protect mandubracius from the violence of cassivellaunus , and send to their state some one to preside over it , and possess the government .
 nor could they be taken prisoners , for they were swift of foot , and knew the country well
 these coats are worn as defensive armour by the princes and most distinguished persons of the tribe they are formed of plates of iron or very tough hides , and though they are absolutely impenetrable to blows , yet they make it difficult for such as have been overthrown by the charge of the enemy to regain their feet
 rights are invariably abridged , as despotism increases
 whatever disputes afranius's soldiers had afterward among themselves , they voluntarily submitted to caesar's decision . 
 they also carry with them into battle certain figures and images taken from their sacred groves
 at the last largess of the emperor you saw yourselves several old men who told you that they had actually shared once and again in the gifts of the divine augustus
 then in the presence of the council one of the chiefs , or the young man's father , or some kinsman , equips him with a shield and a spear
 the emperor's court indeed shuddered , its powerful personages especially , the men who had much to fear from a revolution from secret whisperings they passed to loud complaints when an actor , they said , impudently thrust himself into the imperial chamber , it certainly brought scandal on the state , but we were a long way from ruin
 whether the war was at an end , or whether they might choose to resume the conflict , the vanquished would find in union the sole mitigation of their lot
 titus labienus walked forward from the crowd , and in submissive terms began to speak of peace , and to argue with vatinius . 
 the loyalty of the other armies was unshaken vitellius in addressing the soldiers spoke to the same effect he inveighed against the lately disbanded praetorians , and asserted that false rumours were circulated by them , and that there was no fear of a civil war the name of vespasian he suppressed , and soldiers were dispersed through the city to check the popular gossip
 when these were finished , he drew them down to the river in wagons in one night , a distance of twenty-two miles from his camp , and transported in them some soldiers across the river , and on a sudden took possession of a hill adjoining the bank . 
 but their conversation was suddenly interrupted by darts thrown from all sides , from which vatinius escaped by being protected by the arms of the soldiers . 
 nor did the senate care whether dishonour fell on the extreme frontiers of the empire
 of this series of events , though not exaggerated in the despatches of agricola by any boastfulness of language , domitian heard , as was his wont , with joy in his face but anxiety in his heart
 he discovered that the consuls were gone to dyrrachium with a considerable part of the army , and that pompey remained at brundusium with twenty cohorts ; but could not find out , for a certainty , whether pompey staid behind to keep possession of brundusium , that he might the more easily command the whole adriatic sea , with the extremities of italy and the coast of greece , and be able to conduct the war on either side of it , or whether he remained there for want of shipping ; and , being afraid that pompey would come to the conclusion that he ought not to relinquish italy , he determined to deprive him of the means of communication afforded by the harbor of brundusium . 
 then too the truthfulness of history was impaired in many ways at first , through men's ignorance of public affairs , which were now wholly strange to them , then , through their passion for flattery , or , on the other hand , their hatred of their masters
 all paid him homage and saluted him as king artaxias , which name they gave him from the city
 it was built out on the last boat , and from it engines and machines might be worked to repel the enemy
when caesar was setting out for italy , he sent servius galba with the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry , against the nantuates , the veragri , and seduni , who extend from the territories of the allobroges , and the lake of geneva , and the river rhône to the top of the alps .
 as yet , he said , vologeses had not bestirred himself , simply because they preferred negotiation to violence
 he applauded the courage and firmness of the senate , acquainted them with his force , and told them that he had ten legions ready ; that he was moreover informed and assured that caesar's soldiers were disaffected , and that he could not persuade them to defend or even follow him . 
 after their bath they take their meal , each having a separate seat and table of his own
 they do not go to battle or wear arms
 money was given you , hortalus , by augustus , but without solicitation , and not on the condition of its being always given
those who have remained chaste for the longest time , receive the greatest commendation among their people ; they think that by this the growth is promoted , by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened .
 clodius quirinalis , having , when in command of the crews at ravenna , caused grievous distress to italy by his profligacy and cruelty , just as if it were the most contemptible of countries , forestalled his doom by poison
 not merely be provided with such furniture as is enough for necessary purposes , but also possess among his treasures gold and jewels , so that he may find a frequent pleasure in handling them and gazing on them
 shall we not rather , by delaying one night , till our artillery and engines come up , take with us a strength that must prevail
 first they returned them general thanks for sparing them the day before , when they were greatly terrified , and acknowledged that they were alive through their kindness ; then they inquired about the honor of our general , and whether they could with safety intrust themselves to him ; and declared their sorrow that they had not done so in the beginning , and that they had taken up arms against their relations and kinsmen . 
 yet shame and respect for the presence of their general held them in check , no lasting restraint with men who loved danger and were careless of disgrace
 nothing was more talked about by the common people
 their affairs were under these difficulties ; but of the two schemes proposed , the most expedient seemed to be to return to ilerda , because they had left some corn there ; and there they hoped to decide on a plan for their future conduct . 
some are stimulated by avarice , others by revenge and credulity , which is an innate propensity in that race of men to such a degree that they consider a slight rumor as an ascertained fact .
 gates for making sallies were left in the wall in such places as they thought proper . 
 will percennius and vibulenus give pay to the soldiers and land to those who have earned their discharge
 at the groans of the falling man his freedmen hurried up , and the soldiers , seeing the bloody deed , stood aloof
 but so great was the terror in general , that some said that juba's forces were marching up , others that varus was hastening with his legions , and that they already saw the dust raised by their coming ; of which not one circumstance had happened : others suspected that the enemy's fleet would immediately be upon them . 
 the enemy's troops were frequently reinforced by assistance sent from juba ; strength began to fail our men through fatigue ; and those who had been wounded could neither quit the field nor retire to a place of safety , because the whole field was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry . 
 that party prevailed which preferred that the envoys should be taken by lot , as even the neutral section in the senate exerted themselves to retain the old practice , while the more conspicuous members inclined to the same view , dreading jealousy , should the choice fall on themselves
 he bestowed honours with regard to noble ancestry , military renown , or brilliant accomplishments as a civilian , letting it be clearly seen that there were no better men to choose
 and so now the forum , which is all that our speakers have left them of antiquity , is an evidence of a state not thoroughly reformed or as orderly as we could wish
 at the close of the year was consecrated an arch near the temple of saturn to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost with varus , under the leadership of germanicus and the auspices of tiberius a temple of fors fortuna , by the tiber , in the gardens which caesar , the dictator , bequeathed to the roman people a chapel to the julian family , and statues at bovillae to the divine augustus
 artabanus very soon marched with the whole strength of his kingdom , intent on vengeance
 marriages of cousins were long unknown , but after a time they became frequent
 he was reduced to great difficulties , and distressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary ; insomuch that he was obliged to bring , in transports from corcyra , not only provisions , but even wood and water ; and it once happened that , meeting with violent storms , they were forced to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that covered their decks ; yet all these difficulties they bore patiently and without repining , and thought they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free from blockade . 
 suilius spared not complaint or indignant remonstrance freespoken because of his extreme age as well as from his insolent temper , he taunted seneca with his savage enmity against the friends of claudius , under whose reign he had endured a most righteously deserved exile
for their ships were built and equipped after this manner the keels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships , whereby they could more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide : the prows were raised very high , and , in like manner the sterns were adapted to the force of the waves and storms the ships were built wholly of oak , and designed to endure any force and violence whatever ; the benches which were made of planks a foot in breadth , were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb ; the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables , and for sails they used skins and thin dressed leather .
 and he was to recall his wife , to let the nursling of the legions return and not be handed over as a hostage to the gauls
 but as soon as they again felt secure , they lamented it as though they could not have endured a heavier calamity
 he may then again consider the question , and should a battle be resolved on , we shall fight with increased strength
 lucius antonius too then died , of a most illustrious but unfortunate family
 that a demand for punishment had been submitted to the senate , and that it was right that a penalty should be decreed proportioned to the offence
 others , without the least sense of their disgrace , stowed away about their persons their money and what else they prized most highly , while some got their arms in readiness , and girded on their weapons as if for battle
 soon after , didius gallus consolidated the conquests of his predecessors , and advanced a very few positions into parts more remote , to gain the credit of having enlarged the sphere of government
 then she sent her freedman agerinus to tell her son how by heaven's favour and his good fortune she had escaped a terrible disaster
 for that army there is no where any corn , and without supplies an army cannot be kept together
 accordingly , both he and antonius strove to agitate and disturb wherever there was any weak point
 nowhere was there any loyalty or affection
 on their arrival he made a second camp on another part of the town , and gave the command of it to curio . 
 the name of lutatius catulus , the dedicator , remained among all the vast erections of the emperors , down to the days of vitellius
the besieged run together when these auxiliaries were seen ; mutual congratulations ensue , and the minds of all are elated with joy .
 when corbulo had heard all this from messengers he could trust , he sent two legions under verulanus severus and vettius bolanus to the support of tigranes , with secret instructions that they were to conduct all their operations with deliberation rather than despatch , as he would prefer to sustain rather than to make war and indeed he had written to the emperor that a general was wanted specially for the defence of armenia , and that syria , threatened as it was by vologeses , was in yet more imminent peril
the camp-followers run forward to the nearest rising ground ; being speedily driven from this they throw themselves among the standards and companies : they thus so much the more alarm the soldiers already affrighted .
 it was then for the first time that the elections were transferred from the campus martius to the senate
 the mob was routed by a charge of the cavalry
 plautus again , with his great wealth , does not so much as affect a love of repose , but he flaunts before us his imitations of the old romans , and assumes the self-consciousness of the stoics along with a philosophy , which makes men restless , and eager for a busy life
 this man , though an offender against the law , and convicted of fraud in the reign of nero , had , among the other calamities of war , recovered his rank as a senator
 messalina and silius had been convicted , and now again there were similar grounds for accusation
 there had , in fact , sprung up a hope of the enemy being divided between arminius and segestes , famous , respectively , for treachery and loyalty towards us
 he followed those teachers of philosophy who hold nothing to be good but what is honourable , nothing evil but what is base , and who refuse to count either among things good or evil , power , rank , or indeed any thing not belonging to the mind
 already had the senate commended poppaea's safety to the gods , and had made vows in the state's name , which were repeated again and again and duly discharged
 and no one dared to stop the mischief , because of incessant menaces from a number of persons who forbade the extinguishing of the flames , because again others openly hurled brands , and kept shouting that there was one who gave them authority , either seeking to plunder more freely , or obeying orders
 spurinna , on discovering the enemy's route , informed annius gallus by letter of the successful defence of placentia , of what had happened , and of what caecina intended to do
 these and the like sentiments suited the people , who craved amusement , and feared , always their chief anxiety , scarcity of corn , should he be absent
 caesar , however , did not interrupt his work , relying on the protection of the three legions , and the strength of the fosse . 
 the people would thus behold the one with the decorations of a general , the other in a boy's habit , and would accordingly anticipate their respective destinies
 who , they asked , can be so arrogant as to anticipate in hope an eternity of renown
 on all points but one the defence broke down
 but neither the scourge nor fire , nor the fury of the men as they increased the torture that they might not be a woman's scorn , overcame her positive denial of the charge
 these chiefs also offered the service of their people , and its force of cavalry , their only effective troops but the offer was declined , lest in the midst of civil strife they should attempt some hostile enterprise , or , influenced by higher offers from other quarters , should cast off all sense of right and duty
 volusius was of an old family , which had however never risen beyond the praetorship
 neither arms nor homes have they
 the man , he said , familiar as he was only with profitless studies , and with the ignorance of boyhood , envied those who employed a lively and genuine eloquence in the defence of their fellow-citizens
there were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the phalanx , and with their hands tore away the shields , and wounded the enemy from above .
 they have been emasculated by the circus , the theatre , and the allurements of the capital , or they are worn out with sickness
 first of all came the people of ephesus they declared that diana and apollo were not born at delos , as was the vulgar belief
 he rebuked agrippina with a greek verse , and reminded her that she was not wronged because she was not a queen
 but agrippina's terror was the most conspicuous alarmed by some words dropped by claudius when half intoxicated , that it was his destiny to have to endure his wives' infamy and at last punish it , she determined to act without a moment's delay first she destroyed lepida from motives of feminine jealousy lepida indeed as the daughter of the younger antonia , as the grandniece of augustus , the cousin of agrippina , and sister of her husband cneius , thought herself of equally high rank
 they had afterwards been maintained by the macedonians , then by ourselves
 in fact the whole army had been kindled into indignation by the insolence of the soldiers who came among them from vitellius savage in appearance , and speaking a rude dialect , they ridiculed everybody else as their inferiors
 and he was also careful not to distress the provinces by new burdens , and to see that in bearing the old they were safe from any rapacity or oppression on the part of governors
 but his will was not publicly read , as the preference of the stepson to the son might provoke a sense of wrong and angry feeling in the popular mind
 wherefore , i am neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack their camp without hopes of succeeding ; nor so influenced by fear as to despond : and i imagine that every expedient ought first to be tried ; and i am in a great degree confident that i shall form the same opinions as yourselves on this matter . 
caesar , being aware of their custom , in order that he might not encounter a more formidable war , sets forward to the army earlier in the year than he was accustomed to do .
 they must also weigh the circumstances of their adviser , must see whether he will follow up his advice by imperilling himself , and must know who , should fortune prosper the undertaking , is to have the highest honours
 among other things which provoked men's anger was his house towering above the forum , gay with festal decorations , his banquets and his feasts , about which there was no secrecy , because the place was so public
 on the day , too , on which the praetor antistius was being sentenced to death for libels on nero , thrasea proposed and carried a more merciful decision
 demands made in common are granted slowly
 here is her inmost shrine in such guise and beauty did she first charm mortals , and steal into those virgin hearts which no vice had contaminated
 but sylla called our men in from the pursuit , lest their ardor should carry them too far , but most people imagine that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit , the war might have been ended that day . 
permission being granted to them at their earnest request , vercingetorix at first dissuades them from it , but afterward concedes the point , owing to their entreaties and the compassion of the soldiers .
 pompey , being cut off from dyrrachium , as he was unable to effect his purpose , took a new resolution , and intrenched himself strongly on a rising ground , which is called petra , where ships of a small size can come in , and be sheltered from some winds . 
but caesar , having summoned to him the principal persons of each state , in one case by alarming them , since he declared that he knew what was going on , and in another case by encouraging them , retained a great part of gaul in its allegiance .
 thrasea's freespokenness broke through the servility of the other senators as soon as the consul allowed a division , they voted with him , with but few exceptions among these , the most enthusiastic in his flattery was aulus vitellius , who attacked all the best men with abuse , and was silent when they replied , the usual way of a cowardly temper
 vitellius bestowed a million on sosibius , for giving britannicus the benefit of his teaching and claudius that of his counsels
 then , after the due lustration of his army , he called them together for an harangue , and began with grand allusions to the imperial auspices , and to his own achievements , while he attributed their disasters to the incapacity of paetus he spoke with much impressiveness , which in him , as a military man , was as good as eloquence
 none of these tribes have any noteworthy feature , except their common worship of ertha , or mother-earth , and their belief that she interposes in human affairs , and visits the nations in her car
 it is believed that from this place domitian despatched secret emissaries to cerialis , and tempted his loyalty with the question whether , on his shewing himself , he would hand over to him the command of the army
 salvius titianus , the brother of otho , was never in any peril , for his brotherly affection and his apathetic character screened him from danger
 blaesus ordered a few who had conspicuously loaded themselves with spoil to be scourged and imprisoned as a terror to the rest
 envoys from the colonies were already on the spot praying for aid
 behind them the marsigni , gotini , osi , and buri , close in the rear of the marcomanni and quadi
 i shall speak of rome , and of those native and home-bred vices which take hold of us as soon as we are horn , and multiply with every stage of life , when i have first said a few words on the strict discipline of our ancestors in the education and training of children
 for , as their line shouts , they inspire or feel alarm
this same policy exists throughout the whole of gaul ; for all the states are divided into two factions .
 at alexandria he was informed of the death of pompey : and at his landing there , heard a cry among the soldiers whom the king had left to garrison the town , and saw a crowd gathering toward him , because the fasces were carried before him ; for this the whole multitude thought an infringement of the king's dignity . 
 that same year levies of troops were held in narbon gaul , africa and asia , to fill up the legions of illyricum , all soldiers in which , worn out by age or ill-health , were receiving their discharge
 one day it happened that at no great distance from the camp the germans were endeavouring to drag off to their own bank a vessel laden with corn , which had run aground in the shallows
among these , he is informed by l roscius , the lieutenant whom he had placed over the thirteenth legion , that large forces of those states of the gauls , which are called the armoricae , had assembled for the purpose of attacking him and were not more than eight miles distant ; but intelligence respecting the victory of caesar being carried , had retreated in such a manner that their departure appeared like a flight .
 each branch , as it fills with sap , may be pierced with a fragment of stone or pottery
 piso , too , though his first attempts were unsuccessful , did not omit the safest precautions under present circumstances , but occupied a very strongly fortified position in cilicia , named , celenderis
 attius rufus charged lucius afranius before pompey with betraying the army in the action that happened in spain , and lucius domitius declared in the council that it was his wish that , when the war should be ended , three billets should be given to all the senators , who had taken part with them in the war , and that they should pass sentence on every single person who had staid behind at rome , or who had been within pompey's garrisons and had not contributed their assistance in the military operations ; that by the first billet they should have power to acquit , by the second to pass sentence of death , and by the third to impose a pecuniary fine . 
 the left , which was nearer the river , was occupied by the transrhenane tribes
 as a consequence , the defendant asked an adjournment till next day , and having gone home he charged his kinsman , publius quirinus , with his last prayer to the emperor
 that for his part , he would not avail himself of their present humiliation , or his present advantage , to require terms by which his power might be increased , but only that those armies , which they had maintained for so many years to oppose him , should be disbanded : for six legions had been sent into spain , and a seventh raised there , and many and powerful fleets provided , and generals of great military experience sent to command them , for no other purpose than to oppose him : that none of these measures were adopted to keep the spains in peace , or for the use of the province , which , from the length of the peace , stood in need of no such aid ; that all these things were long since designed against him ; that against him a new sort of government was established , that the same person should be at the gates of rome , to direct the affairs of the city ; and though absent , have the government of two most warlike provinces for so many years : that against him the laws of the magistrates had been altered ; that the late praetors and consuls should not be sent to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom , but persons approved of and chosen by a faction . 
 the barbarians even insolently scoured the sea in hastily constructed vessels of their own called camarae , built with narrow sides and broad bottoms , and joined together without fastenings of brass or iron
this is a town of the senones , situated on an island in the seine , as we have just before observed of lutetia .
 it was customary for the imperial princes to sit during their meals with other nobles of the same age , in the sight of their kinsfolk , at a table of their own , furnished somewhat frugally
 since , he said , by the blessing of the gods the strength of the enemy has been broken , it would little become domitian , now that the war is all but finished , to interfere with the glory of others
 a disaster followed , whether accidental or treacherously contrived by the emperor , is uncertain , as authors have given both accounts , worse , however , and more dreadful than any which have ever happened to this city by the violence of fire
 tiridates towards evening showed himself at some distance whence he could be seen rather than heard
 an experienced king , artabanus knew that men do not necessarily feign hatred because they are false in friendship
 still he spared his eyes the seeing them slain before his face
 for to despise fame is to despise merit
 beginning at an earlier period i will discuss the causes in which this war had its origin , and the extent of the movements which it kindled among independent and allied nations
 but our men , snatching up hatchets and pickaxes , hacked at their bodies and their armour as if they were battering a wall
caesar , having again marched to harass the enemy , after collecting a large number from the neighboring states , dispatches them in all directions .
 every mother suckles her own offspring , and never entrusts it to servants and nurses
 your great-grandfather augustus granted to marcus agrippa the calm repose of mitylene , to caius maecenas what was nearly equivalent to a foreign retreat in the capital itself
caesar , when he perceived that his soldiers were fighting on unfavorable ground , and that the enemy's forces were increasing , being alarmed for the safety of his troops , sent orders to titus sextius , one of his lieutenants , whom he had left to guard the smaller camp , to lead out his cohorts quickly from the camp , and post them at the foot of the hill , on the right wing of the enemy ; that if he should see our men driven from the ground , he should deter the enemy from following too closely .
 for you i feel shame and compassion
 i fought the same battle in germany , as did mucianus in syria , aponius in moesia , flavianus in pannonia
 then , when corrupt practices were suspected in the voting , men were chosen by lot for the office out of the whole number of praetors
when caesar was informed by spies that the helvetii had already conveyed three parts of their forces across that river , but that the fourth part was left behind on this side of the saône , he set out from the camp with three legions during the third watch , and came up with that division which had not yet crossed the river .
 the two generals were equally blameworthy
 the batavians had raised a tower two stories high , which they brought up to the praetorian gate of the camp , where the ground was most level but our men , pushing forward strong poles , and battering it with beams , broke it down , causing great destruction among the combatants on the top
this first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers , the prefects and the rest , who , having followed caesar from the city from motives of friendship , had no great experience in military affairs .
 what a day would that be when he should expose himself with his sixty years upon him , and the two young men , his sons , to the perils of war ! in private enterprises men may advance or recede , and presume more or less upon fortune as they may choose , whereas they who aim at empire have no alternative between the highest success and utter downfall
 he expatiated on their injustice , in taking away his legions : their cruelty and insolence in abridging the privileges of the tribunes ; the proposals he had made , and his entreaties of an interview which had been refused him . 
 but if through fear they declined it , he would not be a burden to them , but take the management of it on himself . 
 i have made these preliminary remarks to show that any credit reflected on the age by the fame and renown of these orators is common property , and is in fact more closely connected with us than with servius galba or caius carbo , and others whom we may rightly call ancients
 they go to the son , not to the eldest , as does the other property , but to the most warlike and courageous
 few of the citizens could be seen in the streets , the populace were dejected , the soldiers walked with downcast looks , and seemed gloomy rather than penitent
 exposed and reckless , the troops came close under the walls , stupefied by excess in food and wine
 then as the slowness of his end brought with it grievous anguish , turning his eyes on demetrius
 the functions of empire were discharged by caecina and valens they had long before been led to suspect each other by animosities scarcely concealed amid the cares of the campaign and the camp , and aggravated by unprincipled friends and a state of society calculated to produce such feuds in their struggles for popularity , in their long retinues , and in the vast crowds at their levees , they vied with each other and challenged comparison , while the favour of vitellius inclined first to one , and then to the other
 many surrendered themselves on the strength of this amnesty
 is it that , while every day something is asked from them , those to whom they grant it feel indignant
 a day spent in crime found its last horror in the rejoicings that concluded it
 uproar , wounds , bloodshed , were everywhere visible
crassus , having exhorted the commanders of the horse to animate their men by great rewards and promises , points out to them what he wished to have done .
 the greater number threw down their arms , and begged for quarter
 if you repent of your compact , it is not against me , whom you treacherously deceived , that you must draw the sword , nor is it against the son of vespasian , who is yet of tender age
 before the world he affected humility in his heart he lusted after supremacy , for the sake of which he sometimes lavish and luxurious , but oftener energetic and watchful , qualities quite as mischievous when hypocritically assumed for the attainment of sovereignty
 for which reasons , he begged and desired that they would undertake the management of the republic , and unite with him in the administration of it . 
 why , on the first day of our meeting , why did you , my friends , wrest from me , in your blindness , the steel which i was preparing to plunge into my breast
 jerusalem must fall at once , or it would delay his enjoyment of them
 piso was wholly unmoved by this statement the centurion despatched by mucianus , on landing in the port of carthage , raised his voice , and invoked in succession all blessings on the head of piso , as if he were emperor , and bade the bystanders , who were astonished by this sudden and strange proceeding , take up the same cry
 nor was the present going smoothly with him the seige was a failure tigranes was safe with his troops and supplies those who had undertaken the storming of the place had been routed
 the accused tried the steel in vain , and then allowed his veins to be opened
 aelia paetina however , of the family of the tuberones , had the support of narcissus
while they were fighting , one of his followers mounted him on a horse ; the woods sheltered him as he fled .
it was supported by the cohorts of the thirteenth legion , which , being led from the smaller camp , had , under the command of titus sextius , occupied the higher ground .
 caecina , having ascertained that the alarm was groundless , yet being unable to stop or stay the soldiers by authority or entreaties or even by force , threw himself to the earth in the gateway , and at last by an appeal to their pity , as they would have had to pass over the body of their commander , closed the way
 in short , pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the honors or sums of money which were to be their rewards , or of vengeance on their enemies ; and never considered how they were to defeat their enemies , but in what manner they should use their victory . 
 although your ears , maternus , may loathe what i am about to say , i ask what good it is if agamemnon or jason speaks eloquently in your composition
 they reviled him as a deserter and traitor , not having any specific charge against him , but all , after the fashion of the mob , imputing to him their own crimes
 then in the same chamber , with the same weapon , they sundered their veins , and speedily hurried into a bath , covered each , as delicacy required , with a single garment , the father gazing intently on his daughter , the grandmother on her grandchild , she again on both , while with rival earnestness they prayed that the ebbing life might have a quick departure , each wishing to leave a relative still surviving , but just on the verge of death
 this circumstance saved the money at ephesus . 
 in the late troubles we had this consolation , a capital unstained by bloodshed , and power transferred without strife
 embassadors came to him even from cingulum , a town which labienus had laid out and built at his own expense , and offered most earnestly to comply with his orders . 
 it was during this consulship , in the eight hundredth year after the foundation of rome and the sixty-fourth after their celebration by augustus that the secular games were exhibited
 and he was now drawing to himself a multitude of young men and much popular enthusiasm , enjoying the present and cherishing idle hopes of the future , when poppaeus sabinus heard of the affair
 caesar thought he ought to postpone all business and pursue pompey , whithersoever he should retreat ; that he might not be able to provide fresh forces , and renew the war ; he therefore marched on every day , as far as his cavalry were able to advance , and ordered one legion to follow him by shorter journeys . 
 piso , acting on the information of sagitta , or , perhaps , from natural modesty , would not make his appearance in public , or trust himself to the zeal of the populace
 should however war be persisted in , the arsacids would not want the courage and good fortune which had already been proved more than once by disaster to rome
 she was soon afterwards banished to campania under military surveillance
he permitted him , if he thought it necessary , to station the legion in these places , for the purpose of wintering .
 a night was fixed , and pontia intrusted the charge of her chamber to a female slave acquainted with her secret
 moved by this apprehension , valens , while he retained a few attendants whom adversity had not changed , sent on the infantry to ariminum and ordered the cavalry to cover his rear he then himself made his way to umbria , and thence to etruria , where , having learnt the issue of the battle of cremona , he conceived a plan not wanting in vigour , and which , had it succeeded , would have had terrible results this was to seize some ships , to land on some part of gallia narbonensis , to rouse gaul with its armies as well as the tribes of germany , and so to kindle a fresh war
 the third year of his campaigns opened up new tribes , our ravages on the native population being carried as far as the taus , an estuary so called
 but when caesar perceived that they had proposed the conference merely to avoid present danger and distress , but that they offered no hopes or terms of peace , he applied his thoughts to the prosecution of the war . 
 thus they lived in fame and honour , as if on the strength of their merits
 he consented , and ordered the masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore early in the evening . 
 as it was , the cavalry did not pursue , for a storm of rain suddenly fell , and night was at hand
 one thing they ought insatiably to pursue , that their memory may be glorious
the cavalry of ariovistus also took their stand at an equal distance .
 rain is uncommon , but the soil is fertile
 the coelaletae , odrusae and dii , powerful tribes , took up arms , under different leaders , all on a level from their obscurity
 and so the people grieved the more bitterly as though germanicus was again lost to them
 a few approved the general's policy , but it was unfavourably canvassed by the army at large
there was a commanding view from the entire camp , which occupied a ridge of hills ; and the minds of all the soldiers anxiously awaited the issue of the battle .
 dolabella , on hearing of the death of otho , had entered the capital
who , when he arrives among them as a deserter , lays before them the fears of the romans ; and informs them by what difficulties caesar himself was harassed , and that the matter was not far removed from this—that sabinus would the next night privately draw off his army out of the camp and set forth to caesar for the purpose of carrying assistance , which , when they heard , they all cry out together that an opportunity of successfully conducting their enterprise , ought not to be thrown away : that they ought to go to the camp .
 the senate also decreed her two lictors , with the office of priestess to claudius , and voted to the late emperor a censor's funeral , which was soon followed by deification
 agrippina , too , continued to exalt her own dignity
 he had sent them to recall the memory of friendship and alliance , with an assurance that he wished for a renewal of the emblems of concord , and that he would in honour of germanicus yield the point of advancing to the bank of the euphrates he begged meanwhile that vonones might not be kept in syria , where , by emissaries from an easy distance , he might draw the chiefs of the tribes into civil strife
 two remarkable men died at the end of the year , lucius volusius and sallustius crispus
 days of public thanksgiving were appointed on the suggestion of pomponius flaccus offerings were given to jupiter , mars , and concord , and the 13th day of september , on which libo had killed himself , was to be observed as a festival , on the motion of gallus asinius , papius mutilus , and lucius apronius
 caesar , that he might the more easily keep pompey's horse inclosed within dyrrachium , and prevent them from foraging , fortified the two narrow passes already mentioned with strong works , and erected forts at them . 
 agricola was born on the 13th of june , in the third consulate of caius cæsar
 when this success became known , two legions , the seventh galba's and the eighteenth the gemina , finding the campaign opening in favour of the flavianists , repaired with alacrity to patavium under the command of vedius aquila the legate a few days were there taken for rest , and minucius justus , prefect of the camp in the 7th legion , who ruled with more strictness than a civil war will permit , was withdrawn from the exasperated soldiery , and sent to vespasian
caesar , having encouraged the remi , and addressed them courteously , ordered the whole senate to assemble before him , and the children of their chief men to be brought to him as hostages ; all which commands they punctually performed by the day .
 and he was strongly supported by the sympathies of the senate
but if he would depart and resign to him the free possession of gaul , he would recompense him with a great reward , and would bring to a close whatever wars he wished to be carried on , without any trouble or risk to him .
 aetolia , acarnania , and amphilochis , being reduced , as we have related , by cassius longinus , and calvisius sabinus , caesar thought he ought to attempt the conquest of achaia , and to advance further into the country . 
 true but it is common in other countries , and there is no law to forbid it
 caesar ordered the enemy's soldiers , who had come into his camp to hold a conference , to be searched for with the strictest diligence , and sent back . 
 and so that day passed without any dreadful result
 there was also a report , ingeniously spread and recklessly believed , to the effect that the legions were being decimated , and all the most energetic centurions dismissed
 former contests , in which , with varying fortune , the romans were resisted , still left in us a last hope of succour , inasmuch as being the most renowned nation of britain , dwelling in the very heart of the country , and out of sight of the shores of the conquered , we could keep even our eyes unpolluted by the contagion of slavery to us who dwell on the uttermost confines of the earth and of freedom , this remote sanctuary of britain's glory has up to this time been a defence
 he was near the old camp , when classicus and tutor , who had gone on in advance under the pretence of reconnoitring , concluded an agreement with the german chiefs
 he was unwilling that , in the mean time , the veteran army , and the two spains , one of which was bound to pompey by the strongest obligations , should be confirmed in his interest ; that auxiliaries and cavalry should be provided , and gaul and italy reduced in his absence . 
they thought that they should either persuade the allobroges , because they did not seem as yet well-affected toward the roman people , or compel them by force to allow them to pass through their territories .
 catualda had a like downfall and no better refuge
vercingetorix , when he ascertained the arrival of caesar , desisted from the siege , and marched to meet caesar .
 the presses were being trodden
 there were two armies on the bank of the rhine
 war will of itself discover and lay open the hidden and rankling wounds of the victorious party
 as to the body which , before it was burnt , lay bare in the forum at antioch , its destined place of burial , it is doubtful whether it exhibited the marks of poisoning
 he flogged to death every tenth man drawn by lot from the disgraced cohort so beneficial was this rigour that a detachment of veterans , numbering not more than five hundred , routed those same troops of tacfarinas on their attacking a fortress named thala
 their number is fixed , a hundred from each canton
 then came the first legion , and , with the baggage in the centre , the men of the twenty-first closed up the left , those of the fifth , the right flank the twentieth legion secured the rear , and , next , were the rest of the allies
 being thus incapable of pursuing , as caesar had foreseen , about noon he gave the signal for marching , led out his army , and doubling that day's march , he advanced eight miles beyond pompey's camp ; who could not pursue him , because his troops were dispersed . 
 meanwhile flaccus , who had heard of the siege of the camp , and had sent into all parts of gaul to collect auxiliaries , put under command of dillius vocula , legate of the 18th legion , some troops picked from the legions with orders to hasten by forced marches along the banks of the rhine flaccus himself , who was weak in health and disliked by his troops , travelled with the fleet
 he could not be forced to divulge his accomplices
 he pretended to act as a judge towards the children of germanicus , after having suborned persons to assume the part of prosecutors and to inveigh specially against nero , next in succession to the throne , who , though he had proper youthful modesty , often forgot present expediency , while freedmen and clients , eager to get power , incited him to display vigour and self-confidence this , they said , was what the roman people wished , what the armies desired , and sejanus would not dare to oppose it , though now he insulted alike the tame spirit of the old emperor and the timidity of the young prince
for as to the enemy's horse , they ought not to entertain a doubt that none of them would dare to advance beyond the main body .
his personal enemies had killed him when in the third year of his reign , many even of his own state being openly promoters this event is related to caesar .
 one would have thought it a different senate , a different people
 because every one practised self-control
neither in position nor in numbers was the contest an equal one to the romans ; at the same time , being exhausted by running and the long continuation of the fight , they could not easily withstand fresh and vigorous troops .
 sabura gave his men the signal , marshaled his army , and began to go around his ranks and encourage them . 
in the mean time battle was commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action .
 their old hatred of hordeonius reappeared
 one would not have thought that it was italy , the fields , and the habitations of their native country , that they were passing through
 that seneca's reply was that mutual conversations and frequent interviews were to the advantage of neither , but still that his own life depended on piso's safety
 having then assembled them at his headquarters , and ordered them to hear his words in silence , he reminded them of the urgency of the crisis
 for it is the husband's fault if the wife transgresses propriety
 when vitellius was dead , the war had indeed come to an end , but peace had yet to begin
 if you do not believe me , let me go and pursue me
 consequently , though there was less loss of life , the temples of the gods , and the porticoes which were devoted to enjoyment , fell in a yet more widespread ruin
 the end of his life , a deplorable calamity to us and a grief to his friends , was regarded with concern even by strangers and those who knew him not
 these words wrung from the emperor one of the rare utterances of that inscrutable breast
 then had followed a loyal adherence to galba
the siege having been impeded by so many disadvantages , the soldiers , although they were retarded during the whole time by the mud , cold , and constant showers , yet by their incessant labor overcame all these obstacles , and in twenty-five days raised a mound three hundred and thirty feet broad and eighty feet high .
 he , with a grief and anger that were yet fresh , thus began to address the throng around him -
 this was the building that was now on fire
 doubtless his arrival had restored the fortunes of the party , and his victory had reversed the unfavourable rumours occasioned by his tardy advance
for this enactment they advance many reasons-lest seduced by long-continued custom , they may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture ; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estates , and the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions ; lest they construct their houses with too great a desire to avoid cold and heat ; lest the desire of wealth spring up , from which cause divisions and discords arise ; and that they may keep the common people in a contented state of mind , when each sees his own means placed on an equality with the most powerful .
 he is slow to rouse himself , and seldom warms to his subject , and only an idea here and there is brought to a fitting and a brilliant close
 there was a younger generation , sprung up since the victory of actium , and even many of the older men had been born during the civil wars
 a force for this purpose was given him , which great panic everywhere preceded
 do not however be alarmed , if , after a movement which has shaken the world , two legions are not yet quiet
 it is a custom of these princes , whenever they join alliance , to unite their right hands and bind together the thumbs in a tight knot
 agrippina's friends too were induced to be always inciting her proud spirit by mischievous talk
 prodigies which were now noised abroad from various sources increased men's terror
 this a general should endeavor not to repress , but to increase ; nor was it a vain institution of our ancestors , that the trumpets should sound on all sides , and a general shout be raised ; by which they imagined that the enemy were struck with terror , and their own army inspired with courage . 
when these had met him on the way and had thrown themselves at his feet , and speaking in suppliant tone had with tears sued for peace , and he had ordered them to await his arrival , in the place , where they then were , they obeyed his commands .
 at this uncommon occurrence , the whole progress of the war was stopped , and the soldiers , turning away from the battle , ran eagerly to hear and listen to them . 
 if brought into popular odium , or under some charge , they had to reply in their own words
 both were in a desperate plight from their position
 at the time he was chiefly occupied with macedonia , but he also had the charge of achaia
 he then enjoyed an uninterrupted succession of honours , first filling the praetorship , and then commanding a legion with general satisfaction , but he subsequently incurred the degrading imputation of having pilfered a gold cup at the table of claudius , who the next day directed that he alone should be served on earthenware
this among them is the most heavy punishment .
 there was also an excuse for mere youths referring some matters to their father , with the possibility that he could conciliate or crush those who resisted germanicus or drusus
 subsequently , becoming a senator by the influence of sejanus , he shamed his origin , low as it was , by his unblushing effronteries
 elated by these successes the troops of vitellius would no longer be restrained by the boundaries of the river's bank
 the land that was offered them they contemptuously rejected , and begged for regular service and pay
 nor is it unlike the truth , since a capitulation followed in a few days
 instantly there came a shout from the cohorts , demanding the names of the culprits and their punishment

 as to the survivors of the vitellianist army , they doubted what to do
 vannius's own native force was infantry , and his cavalry was from the iazyges of sarmatia an army which was no match for his numerous enemy consequently , he determined to maintain himself in fortified positions , and protract the war
 for on what , says he , can we rely that we can storm a camp , fortified both by nature and art ? or , indeed , what advantage do we gain if we give over the assault , after having suffered considerable loss ; as if success did not acquire for a general the affection of his army , and misfortune their hatred ? but what does a change of camp imply but a shameful flight and universal despair , and the alienation of the army ? for neither ought the obedient to suspect that they are distrusted , nor the insolent to know that we fear them ; because our fears augment the licentiousness of the latter , and diminish the zeal of the former . 
 more than 30 , 000 armed men were now to be seen , and still there were pressing in all the youth of the country , with all whose old age was yet hale and vigorous , men renowned in war and bearing each decorations of his own meanwhile , among the many leaders , one superior to the rest in valour and in birth , galgacus by name , is said to have thus harangued the multitude gathered around him and clamouring for battle 
 the first day , however , was spent in a furious onset rather than in the skilful approaches of a veteran army
 these and the like complaints , rendered impressive by tears and by the cunning of an adulteress , no one checked , as all longed to see the mother's power broken , while not a person believed that the son's hatred would steel his heart to her murder
 men did not doubt that his answer prescribed him by tiberius , inasmuch as one who had generally all the simplicity and candour of youth , now had recourse to the artifices of old age

 it is said that one vettius valens climbed a very lofty tree in sport , and when they asked him what he saw , replied , a terrible storm from ostia possibly such appearance had begun perhaps , a word dropped by chance became a prophecy
 in the consulship of faustus sulla and salvius otho , furius scribonianus was banished on the ground that he was consulting the astrologers about the emperor's death
 mockery of every sort was added to their deaths covered with the skins of beasts , they were torn by dogs and perished , or were nailed to crosses , or were doomed to the flames and burnt , to serve as a nightly illumination , when daylight had expired
 for the tranquillity of nations cannot be preserved without armies
 still , he said , they must bear with the caprices of kings , and frequent revolutions were bad
 for round pompey's camps there were several high and rough hills . 
 on him all thoughts are fixed , while vitellius , regardless alike of friends and foes , is cherishing a rival , who from his banqueting table gazes at the sufferings of his sovereign
 he could , it is said , scarcely be driven to confess to corbulo how the enemy was pressing him
 silana was banished calvisius and iturius exiled for a time
he therefore provided remedies against all contingencies ; for he daily conveyed corn from the country parts into the camp , used the timber and brass of such ships as were most seriously damaged for repairing the rest , and ordered whatever things besides were necessary for this object to be brought to him from the continent .
 the generals , finding themselves in a country utterly impoverished by war , were terrified by the scarcity of provisions and the mutinous clamours of the soldiery , who incessantly demanded the clavarium , as the donative was called
 the arrangement of this business had been variously and frequently altered
being astonished , he inquires the reason of it from the deserters , a great number of whom flocked to him daily .
 his progress had nothing of imperial state about it , but was marked by the poverty of his former condition , till junius blaesus , governor of gallia lugdunensis , a man of noble birth , whose munificence was equal to his wealth , furnished him with suitable attendance , and escorted him with a splendid retinue a service which was of itself displeasing , though vitellius masked his dislike under servile compliments
 the crews were made up with dalmatians the army and generals halted at the temple of fortune , undecided as to their line of action they had heard that the praetorian guard had marched out of rome , and they supposed that the apennines were occupied with troops
 in a speech to the soldiers he promised them lands out of his own estate ; to every private soldier four acres , and a corresponding share to the centurions and veterans . 
 cornelius dolabella however , by way of carrying flattery yet further , sharply censured the morals of silanus , and then moved that no one of disgraceful life and notorious infamy should be eligible for a province , and that of this the emperor should be judge
 the senate on being consulted had , without handling the matter , referred it to the emperor tiberius , after long considering whether such reckless tastes could be repressed , whether the repression of them would not be still more hurtful to the state , also , how undignified it would be to meddle with what he could not succeed in , or what , if effected , would necessitate the disgrace and infamy of men of distinction , at last addressed a letter to the senate to the following purport 
 in an army which included such varieties of language and character , an army comprising roman citizens , allies , and foreigners , there was every kind of lust , each had a law of his own , and nothing was forbidden
 what hatred would be incurred from those whose election was deferred for five years ! how could he foresee through so long an interval what would be a man's temper , or domestic relations , or estate
 well
 what we have rather to avoid is this , that a mind unsettled by the novelty of power , and which will keenly watch the very looks and language of all , should be irritated by the obstinacy of certain persons
 the savage temper of nero amused itself under these forms , and i found the friendship of such a prince as harassing as others found their exile
the gauls' mode of besieging is the same as that of the belgae : when after having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the fortifications , stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all sides , and the wall has been stripped of its defenders , , forming a testudo , they advance to the gates and undermine the wall : which was easily effected on this occasion ; for while so large a number were casting stones and darts , no one was able to maintain his position upon the wall .
 priscus and gallus were accompanied respectively by their wives , artoria flaccilla and egnatia maximilla
a certain gaul before the gate of the town , who was casting into the fire opposite the turret balls of tallow and fire which were passed along to him , was pierced with a dart on the right side and fell dead .
 besides trio and catus , fonteius agrippa and caius vibius were among his accusers , and claimed with eager rivalry the privilege of conducting the case for the prosecution , till vibius , as they would not yield one to the other , and libo had entered without counsel , offered to state the charges against him singly , and produced an extravagantly absurd accusation , according to which libo had consulted persons whether he would have such wealth as to be able to cover the appian road as far as brundisium with money
 i think it proper , however , before i commence my purposed work , to pass under review the condition of the capital , the temper of the armies , the attitude of the provinces , and the elements of weakness and strength which existed throughout the whole empire , that so we may become acquainted , not only with the vicissitudes and the issues of events , which are often matters of chance , but also with their relations and their causes
 but after the departure of the liburnian fleet , marcus octavius sailed from illyricum with what ships he had to salona , and having spirited up the dalmatians , and other barbarous nations , he drew issa off from its connection with caesar ; but not being able to prevail with the council of salona , either by promises or menaces , he resolved to storm the town . 
 but the costly preparations for gluttony and dissipation were the theme of incessant talk , and had suggested a fear that a prince who clung to oldfashioned frugality would be too stern in his reforms
 the massilians conveyed their arms and engines out of the town , as they were ordered : brought their ships out of the port and docks , and delivered up the money in their treasury . 
 to strike a slave or to punish him with bonds or with hard labour is a rare occurrence

all the britons , indeed , dye themselves with woad , which occasions a bluish color , and thereby have a more terrible appearance in fight .
on their arrival , as they were mounted on unserviceable horses , he takes horses from the military tribunes and the rest , nay , even from the roman knights and veterans , and distributes them among the germans .
 a few , who attempted to resist , were cut down the great majority , with the usual love of change , were ready to join vespasian
the enemy having been scattered and alarmed , as we related above , there was no force which might produce even a slight occasion of fear .
 he called an assembly , and heaped praises on the valour of the soldiers
 caesar , to spread devastation widely , divided his eager legions into four columns , and ravaged a space of fifty miles with fire and sword
 yet even when the final decision rests with the people , the affair is always thoroughly discussed by the chiefs
 besides subrius and sulpicius , whom i have already mentioned , they invited the aid of military strength , of gavius silvanus and statius proximus , tribunes of praetorian cohorts , and of two centurions , maximus scaurus and venetus paulus
our soldiers , being hard pressed on every side , were dislodged from their position , with the loss of forty-six centurions ; but the tenth legion , which had been posted in reserve on ground a little more level , checked the gauls in their eager pursuit .
 wherever a name could be found for any thing , it was deemed a sufficient reason for levying money on it . 
 as for the scholars , there can be no improvement , when boys and striplings with equal assurance ad , dress , and are addressed by , other boys and striplings
 it is , indeed , human nature to hate the man whom you have injured
 besides this , a mutiny broke out in the camp because the whole army was not led into action
 some , taken by surprise , ran hither and thither , while those whose discernment was keener , remained motionless , with their eyes fixed on nero , who , as he still reclined in seeming unconsciousness , said that this was a common occurrence , from a periodical epilepsy , with which britannicus had been afflicted from his earliest infancy , and that his sight and senses would gradually return as for agrippina , her terror and confusion , though her countenance struggled to hide it , so visibly appeared , that she was clearly just as ignorant as was octavia , britannicus's own sister
 but perceiving that he kept within his trenches , he led his army back to his camp , and thought of pursuing some other plan . 
these being thus laid and cemented together , another row is added above , in such a manner , that the same interval may be observed , and that the beams may not touch one another , but equal spaces intervening , each row of beams is kept firmly in its place by a row of stones .
 it was indeed a desperate contest whether the aunt or the mother should have most power over nero
the only guards provided against all these contingencies were twenty-two cohorts , which were collected from the entire province by lucius caesar , the lieutenant , and opposed to the enemy in every quarter .
 meanwhile vespasian now consul for the second time and titus entered upon their office , both being absent from rome people were gloomy and anxious under the pressure of manifold fears , for , over and above immediate perils , they had taken groundless alarm under the impression that africa was in rebellion through the revolutionary movements of lucius piso
 behind them the third line was carrying on the work without being seen ; so that the whole was completed before afranius discovered that the camp was being fortified .

 having read pompey's letter , domitius , concealing the truth , gave out in council that pompey would speedily come to their assistance ; and encouraged them not to despond , but to provide every thing necessary for the defense of the town . 
 we have the testimony of the letters of augustus , the testimony too of the people themselves , who , on hearing in the theatre some of virgil's verses , rose in a body and did homage to the poet , who happened to be present as a spectator , just as to augustus himself
galba having fought some successful battles and stormed several of their forts , upon embassadors being sent to him from all parts and hostages given and a peace concluded , determined to station two cohorts among the nantuates , and to winter in person with the other cohorts of that legion in a village of the veragri , which is called octodurus ; and this village being situated in a valley , with a small plain annexed to it , is bounded on all sides by very high mountains .
when this speech had been delivered by diviciacus , all who were present began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of caesar .
that they who had been the leaders of that plot , because they perceived how great a calamity they had brought upon the state , had fled into britain .
 and though he was very much surprised that magius , whom he had sent to pompey with a message , was not sent back to him ; and though his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous prosecution of his plans , yet he thought that he ought by all means to persevere in the same line of conduct . 
 some there were who reproached men of austere professions with having on such an occasion divided houses and estates among themselves , like so much spoil
they knew that the passes by land were cut off by estuaries , that the approach by sea was most difficult , by reason of our ignorance of the localities , the small number of the harbors , and they trusted that our army would not be able to stay very long among them , on account of the insufficiency of corn ; and again , even if all these things should turn out contrary to their expectation , yet they were very powerful in their navy .
 when they go into battle , it is a disgrace for the chief to be surpassed in valour , a disgrace for his followers not to equal the valour of the chief
 this speech , which was meant to touch and to calm the feelings of the soldiers , and the moderate amount of severity exercised for otho had ordered two and no more to be punished , met with a grateful acceptance , and for the moment reduced to order men who could not be coerced
 upon this the emperor granted pardon to caractacus , to his wife , and to his brothers
 it was decided that vessels of solid gold should not be made for the serving of food , and that men should not disgrace themselves with silken clothing from the east
 scipio spoke to the same purport , that it was pompey's intention not to abandon the republic , if the senate would support him ; but if they should hesitate and act without energy , they would in vain implore his aid , if they should require it hereafter . 
 the towns and colonies , however , found indications of a haughty spirit in the general's dress , when they saw the cloak of various colours , and the trews , a garment of foreign fashion , clothed in which he was wont to speak to their toga-clad citizens
 meanwhile he posted his remaining legions on the bank of the euphrates , armed a hastily collected force of provincials , and occupied with troops the enemy's approaches

 alarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity , the procurator catus crossed over into gaul
 the auxiliary infantry and cavalry moved in advance of the main body of the legions the capital itself contributed no contemptible force , namely five praetorian cohorts , some troops of cavalry , and the first legion , and together with these , 2000 gladiators , a disreputable kind of auxiliaries , but employed throughout the civil wars even by strict disciplinarians
 their villages they do not arrange in our fashion , with the buildings connected and joined together , but every person surrounds his dwelling with an open space , either as a precaution against the disasters of fire , or because they do not know how to build no use is made by them of stone or tile
 then beginning with a reverent mention of augustus , he passed on to the victories and triumphs of tiberius , dwelling with especial praise on his glorious achievements with those legions in germany
 he immediately called off his legions from the work , and put them in battle array the horse began the battle : and before the legions could be completely marshaled and take their ground , the king's entire forces being thrown into disorder and confusion , because they had marched without any order , and were under no apprehensions , betake themselves to flight : almost all the enemy's horse being safe , because they made a speedy retreat into the town along the shore , caesar's soldiers slay a great number of their infantry . 
 fonteius agrippa was removed from asia which province he had governed as proconsul for a year to moesia , and had some troops given him from the army of vitellius that this army should be dispersed through the provinces and closely occupied with foreign wars , was sound policy and essential to peace
 and although many of the emperor's household and knights and senators were said to have supported him with their wealth and helped him with their counsels , no inquiry was made

 in the year of the consulship of marcus licinius and lucius calpurnius , the losses of a great war were matched by an unexpected disaster , no sooner begun than ended
 early in this year titus caesar , who had been selected by his father to complete the subjugation of judaea , and who had gained distinction as a soldier while both were still subjects , began to rise in power and reputation , as armies and provinces emulated each other in their attachment to him
 audience was also given to embassies from other states
 their physical characteristics are various , and from these conclusions may be drawn
 the contest grew fiercer , while the well-disposed majority on the one side , and a powerful minority on the other , fought out their obstinate quarrel , and thus the day was spent in altercation
 for how few read his speeches against asitius or drusus ! certainly his impeachment of vatinius , as it is entitled , is in the hands of students , especially the second of the orations
 then again alarms under various forms were continually arising one man would avoid meeting him another after returning his salutation would instantly turn away many after beginning a conversation would instantly break it off , while sejanus's friends would stand their ground and laugh at him
 it was an ill-starred year , people began to say , and the emperor's purpose of leaving rome must have been formed under evil omens they began in vulgar fashion to trace ill-luck to guilt , when tiberius checked them by distributing money in proportion to losses sustained
the gauls , having discovered the matter through their scouts , abandon the blockade , and march toward caesar with all their forces ; these were about 60 , 000 armed men .
 in like manner , valinius , who was then governor of brundusium , with a few decked barks , endeavored to entice laelius's fleet , and took one five-banked galley and two smaller vessels that had ventured further than the rest into a narrow part of the harbor : and likewise disposing the horse along the shore , strove to prevent the enemy from procuring fresh water . 
 twelve miles from cremona at a place called the castors he posted some of the bravest of his auxiliaries , concealed in the woods that there overhang the road
 in a word , let the man , wont to act the senator and to screen those who disparage the prince , come among us

 meanwhile the campaign had opened favourably for otho , at whose bidding the armies of dalmatia and pannonia had begun to move
 the senators were summoned , with a special notice that they must consult on a momentous and terrible matter
they requested that they might be allowed to proclaim an assembly of the whole of gaul for a particular day , and to do that with caesar's permission , that they had some things which , with the general consent , they wished to ask of him .
 the estate itself and a large part of her patrimony were plundered
 the origin of the late tumult is to be traced not to rapacity or disaffection , feelings which have driven many armies into civil strife , much less to any shrinking from , or fear of danger
 but as there was a plain six miles in breadth between the two camps , he posted his army before scipio's camp ; while the latter persevered in not quitting his intrenchment . 
 thus , the vigilance of domitius saved cassius , and the expedition of scipio , favonius . 
 in the year of the consulship of cornelius cossus and asinius agrippa , cremutius cordus was arraigned on a new charge , now for the first time heard
 in their funerals there is no pomp

induced by such great advantages , many embrace this profession of their own accord , and are sent to it by their parents and relations .
 this point in his character pleased his adopted father in proportion as it raised the anxious suspicions of others
 chancing to fall in with longinus , the murderer of vocula , they overwhelmed him with a shower of darts , and thus made a beginning towards a future expiation of their guilt

 their repulse and rout was as severe as their onset had been furious thus the enemy's design recoiled on himself , and the cavalry which by the general's order had wheeled round from the van of the contending armies , attacked his rear

caesar on being informed of these movements was of opinion that he ought to make haste , even if he should run some risk in completing the bridges , in order that he might engage before greater forces of the enemy should be collected in that place .
 the arabs made a beginning , and then the rest went to their homes or to the camp of artabanus , till tiridates returned to syria with a few followers and thus relieved all from the disgrace of desertion

 titus vinius and cornelius laco , one the most worthless , the other the most spiritless of mankind , were ruining the weak old emperor , who had to bear the odium of such crimes and the scorn felt for such cowardice
 tiberius indeed and the informers were never weary
they resolved to conduct the war on a very different method from the rest of the gauls ; for as they perceived that the greatest nations who had engaged in war , had been routed and overcome , and as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and morasses , they removed themselves and all their property thither .
 he had raised to the strength of a legion the cilician auxiliaries which the petty kings had sent , by mixing with them some deserters , and the lately intercepted recruits with his own and plancina's slaves
the gauls , having been twice repulsed with great loss , consult what they should do ; they avail themselves of the information of those who were well acquainted with the country ; from them they ascertain the position and fortification of the upper camp .
 recourse is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate which was never resorted to even by daring proposers except when the city was in danger of being set on fire , or when the public safety was despaired of .

 the treveri were panicstricken by this disaster , and the common people threw down their arms , and dispersed themselves through the country
 that same year twelve famous cities of asia fell by an earthquake in the night , so that the destruction was all the more unforeseen and fearful
 philip , one of the tribunes , stopped the appointment of sylla ; the resolutions respecting the other matters passed .

 finally , he addressed the troops in these terms comrades , i am not come that i may move your hearts to love me , or that i may rouse your courage love and courage you have in superfluous abundance i am come to pray you to put some restraint on your valour , some check on your affection for me
 but there , as they lounged in promiscuous crowds in the fields or on the shore , they had to bear day and night alike the patronising smiles and the supercilious insolence of hall-porters , till even this was forbidden them , and those whom sejanus had not deigned to accost or to look on , returned to the capital in alarm , while some felt an evil joy , though there hung over them the dreadful doom of that ill-starred friendship
 receiving answers which were mostly judicious , though in part somewhat incautious , he read out a note written by piso , nearly to the following effect 
 my great-grandfather augustus allowed agrippa and maecenas to enjoy rest after their labours , but he did it at an age carrying with it an authority sufficient to justify any boon , of any sort , he might have bestowed

that practice they seem to me to have adopted for two reasons ; because they neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people , nor those who learn , to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory , relying on writing ; since it generally occurs to most men , that , in their dependence on writing , they relax their diligence in learning thoroughly , and their employment of the memory .

 in fact , it is not a request , but an importunity , as utterly unreasonable as it is unforeseen , for a senator , when the house has met on other matters , to rise from his place and , pleading the number and age of his children , put a pressure on the delicacy of the senate , then transfer the same constraint to myself , and , as it were , break open the exchequer , which , if we exhaust it by improper favouritism , will have to be replenished by crimes
 the throng applauded from various motives , some pointing with indignation to the marks of the lash , others to their grey locks , and most of them to their threadbare garments and naked limbs
 nor did maroboduus abstain from vaunts about himself or from revilings of the foe clasping the hand of inguiomerus , he protested that in the person before them centred all the renown of the cherusci , that to his counsels was due whatever had ended successfully

 the bravest were cut down where they stood
 some indeed assailed him with dark insinuations , implying that from motives of envy and rivalry he was seeking to retard the elevation of his brother
to this he the more easily persuaded them , because the helvetii are confined on every side by the nature of their situation ; on one side by the rhine , a very broad and deep river , which separates the helvetian territory from the germans ; on a second side by the jura , a very high mountain , which is between the sequani and the helvetii ; on a third by the lake of geneva , and by the river rhône , which separates our province from the helvetii .

 the manner of fighting of those soldiers was to run forward with great impetuosity and boldly take a post , and not to keep their ranks strictly , but to fight in small scattered parties : if hard pressed they thought it no disgrace to retire and give up the post , being accustomed to this manner of fighting among the lusitanians and other barbarous nations ; for it commonly happens that soldiers are strongly influenced by the customs of those countries in which they have spent much time . 
one of those next him stepped over him as he lay , and discharged the same office : when the second man was slain in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow , a third succeeded him , and a fourth succeeded the third : nor was this post left vacant by the besieged , until , the fire of the mound having been extinguished , and the enemy repulsed in every direction , an end was put to the fighting .

besides , in their frequent sallies by day and night , they attempted either to set fire to the mound , or attack our soldiers when engaged in the works ; and , moreover , by splicing the upright timbers of their own towers , they equaled the height of ours , as fast as the mound had daily raised them , and countermined our mines , and impeded the working of them by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends , and boiling pitch and stones of very great weight , and prevented them from approaching the walls .

wherefore , since he reflected that almost all the gauls were fond of revolution , and easily and quickly excited to war ; that all men likewise , by nature , love liberty and hate the condition of slavery , he thought he ought to divide and more widely distribute his army , before more states should join the confederation .
 pompeius silvanus was appointed to manage the affair before long , either the necessity ceased or the pretence was dropped after this , on the motion of domitian , the consulships conferred by vitellius were cancelled , and the honours of a censor's funeral were paid to sabinus great lessons both of the mutability of fortune , ever bringing together the highest honours and the lowest humiliations
 in the evening caesar drew his legions within this trench , and rested them under arms the next night the day following he kept his whole army within it , and as it was necessary to bring materials from a considerable distance , he for the present pursued the same plan in his work ; and to each legion , one after the other , he assigned one side of the camp to fortify , and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be cut : he kept the rest of the legions under arms without baggage to oppose the enemy .

 pompey himself , incited by caesar's enemies , because he was unwilling that any person should bear an equal degree of dignity , had wholly alienated himself from caesar's friendship , and procured a reconciliation with their common enemies ; the greatest part of whom he had himself brought upon caesar during his affinity with him . 
 pedius blaesus was also expelled from the senate on the accusation of the people of cyrene , that he had violated the treasury of aesculapius and had tampered with a military levy by bribery and corruption

 but of many who endured punishment or disgrace under tiberius , the descendants yet survive
caesar pitching his camp at that side of the town which was not defended by the river and marsh , and had a very narrow approach , as we have mentioned , began to raise the vineae and erect two towers : for the nature of the place prevented him from drawing a line of circumvallation .

 roscius and lucius caesar , having received this message , went to capua , where they met the consuls and pompey , and declared to them caesar's terms . 
 the legionary soldiers who had the management of the works on the right side , observed , from the frequent sallies of the enemy , that it might prove a great protection to them to build a turret of brick under the wall for a fort and place of refuge , which they at first built low and small , to guard them against sudden attacks .

 violent opinions were expressed ; whoever spoke with the greatest acrimony and cruelty was most highly commended by caesar's enemies . 
to these things caesar replied , that he , in accordance with his custom , rather than owing to their desert , should spare the state , if they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch the wall ; but that there was no condition of surrender , except upon their arms being delivered up ; that he should do to them that which he had done in the case of the nervii , and would command their neighbors not to offer any injury to those who had surrendered to the roman people .

 the people enthusiastically applauded him
cativolcus , king of one half of the eburones , who had entered into the design together with ambiorix , since , being now worn out by age , he was unable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight , having cursed ambiorix with every imprecation , as the person who had been the contriver of that measure , destroyed himself with the juice of the yew-tree , of which there is a great abundance in gaul and germany .
 the germans fought with inconsiderate fury

the helvetii , elated with this battle , because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so large a body of horse , began to face us more boldly , sometimes too from their rear to provoke our men by an attack .
 did a grown up maiden or youth of marked beauty fall in their way , they were torn in pieces by the violent hands of ravishers and in the end the destroyers themselves were provoked into mutual slaughter
it is again told to caesar , that the helvetii intended to march through the country of the sequani and the aedui into the territories of the santones , which are not far distant from those boundaries of the tolosates , which is a state in the province .

 all else was plundered or fired in the onslaught
 for , in point of time , guilt comes before punishment , and correction follows after delinquency and therefore , to meet the new insolence of provincials , let us adopt a measure worthy of roman good faith and resolution , whereby our allies may lose nothing of our protection , while public opinion may cease to say of us , that the estimate of a man's character is to found anywhere rather than in the judgment of our citizens

 and now henceforth the glory and the peril of these illustrious men grew greater
 they show themselves off among the soldiers and have the centurions at their beck
 the squadrons of the treveri charged the enemy incautiously , and found themselves encountered in front by the veteran troops , while on the flanks they were also annoyed by showers of stones from the rustic band , who were skilful throwers , and who , mixed up as they were among the regular soldiers , whether cowardly or brave , were all equally bold in the moment of victory

 two of these tribunes , subrius and cetrius , the soldiers assailed with menaces longinus they seized and disarmed it was not his rank as an officer , but his friendship with galba , that bound him to that prince , and roused a stronger suspicion in the mutineers

the number of the people is countless , and their buildings exceedingly numerous , for the most part very like those of the gauls : the number of cattle is great .
 let me not be aroused by a tumult of morning visitors , or a freedman's panting haste , or , anxious about the future , have to make a will to secure my wealth
 laws , indeed , he said , punish crimes committed
 the gotini , to complete their degradation , actually work iron mines
 while marcellus , with the savage and menacing look he usually wore , spoke these and like words with rising fury in his voice , countenance , and eye , that familiar grief to which a thick succession of perils had habituated the senate gave way to a new and profounder panic , as they saw the soldiers' hands on their weapons
 the doors of the inner shrine were suddenly thrown open , and a voice of more than mortal tone was heard to cry that the gods were departing

the latter had commenced to besiege noviodunum ; and when embassadors came from this town to beg that he would pardon them and spare their lives , in order that he might execute the rest of his designs with the rapidity by which he had accomplished most of them , he orders their arms to be collected , their horses to be brought forth , and hostages to be given .
 nero interposed his veto , allowing them to die without his interference
 his plan too was disconcerted by a succession of alarming tidings , and the desertion of immediate adherents so languid was now the zeal of those who had at first been eager to display their fidelity and courage
 but when the baggage was clogged in the mud and in the fosses , the soldiers around it in disorder , the array of the standards in confusion , every one in selfish haste and all ears deaf to the word of command he ordered the germans to charge , exclaiming again and again , behold a varus and legions once more entangled in varus's fate as he spoke , he cut through the column with some picked men , inflicting wounds chiefly on the horses
ambiorix , when he observed this , orders the command to be issued that they throw their weapons from a distance and do not approach too near , and in whatever direction the romans should make an attack , there give way ; pursue them when betaking themselves to their standards again .
 this usage he had himself revived in labeo's case , but labeo , being pressed by charges of maladministration in his province and other crimes , had screened his guilt by bringing odium on another , and had groundlessly alarmed his wife , who , though criminal , was still free from danger

 while the spirits of the enemy were dismayed at these things , caesar , that he might not be always obliged to send his horse a long circuit round by the bridge , having found a convenient place , began to sink several drains , thirty feet deep , by which he might draw off a part of the river segre , and make a ford over it . 
 the year had now arrived in which the proconsulate of asia or africa was to fall to him by lot , and , as civica had been lately murdered , agricola did not want a warning , or domitian a precedent
 meanwhile agricola , though summer was past and the detachments were scattered throughout the province , though the soldiers' confident anticipation of inaction for that year would be a source of delay and difficulty in beginning a campaign , and most advisers thought it best simply to watch all weak points , resolved to face the peril

having divided the army , he orders t labienus to proceed with three legions toward the ocean into those parts which border on the menapii ; he sends c trebonius with a like number of legions to lay waste that district which lies contiguous to the aduatuci ; he himself determines to go with the remaining three to the river sambre , which flows into the meuse , and to the most remote parts of arduenna , whither he heard that ambiorix had gone with a few horse .
 to accomplish these works , caius trebonius sends for a great quantity of carriages and men from the whole province , and orders hurdles and materials to be furnished .

 let us actually decide that the master was justly slain
 at the same moment he was covered with wounds , and though pierced through the eye , he resolutely faced the enemy and ceased not to fight till he fell deserted by his men
while the gauls were at a distance from the fortification , they did more execution , owing to the immense number of their weapons : after they came nearer , they either unawares empaled themselves on the spurs , or were pierced by the mural darts from the ramparts and towers , and thus perished .
this the belgae on their march began to attack with great vigor .
 crushed by a conspiracy of my foes and the odium excited by a lying charge , since my truth and innocence find no place here , i call the immortal gods to witness that towards you caesar , i have lived loyally , and with like dutiful respect towards your mother
 the vitellianists whose infantry was inferior , but who were strong in cavalry , stationed the mountaineers on the neighbouring heights , and their infantry in close ranks behind the cavalry
 the third legion set the example to the other legions of moesia
 these men are quarrelsome , indolent , and profligate , and their own faults will make war fatal to the one , and success to the other
 it is not , he said , plains only which are good for the fighting of roman soldiers , but woods and forest passes , if science be used
 the first death under the new emperor , that of junius silanus , proconsul of asia , was , without nero's knowledge , planned by the treachery of agrippina not that silanus had provoked destruction by any violence of temper , apathetic as he was , and so utterly despised under former despotisms , that caius caesar used to call him the golden sheep
 the enemy were attacked in their confusion by a sudden and successful sally
 many were thus slain or surprised blaesus then further divided his triple army into several detachments under the command of centurions of tried valour at the end of the summer he did not , as was usual , withdraw his troops and let them rest in winter-quarters in the old province but , forming a chain of forts , as though he were on the threshold of a campaign , he drove tacfarinas by flying columns well acquainted with the desert , from one set of huts to another , till he captured the chief's brother , and then returned , too soon however for the welfare of our allies , as there yet remained those who might renew hostilities tiberius however considered the war as finished , and awarded blaesus the further distinction of being hailed imperator by the legions , an ancient honour conferred on generals who for good service to the state were saluted with cheers of joyful enthusiasm by a victorious army
 even on this occasion the roman fleet was not present at the engagement , though orders had been given to that effect
 in pompey's camp you might see arbors in which tables were laid , a large quantity of plate set out , the floors of the tents covered with fresh sods , the tents of lucius lentulus and others shaded with ivy , and many other things which were proofs of excessive luxury , and a confidence of victory , so that it might readily be inferred that they had no apprehensions of the issue of the day , as they indulged themselves in unnecessary pleasures , and yet upbraided with luxury caesar's army , distressed and suffering troops , who had always been in want of common necessaries . 
 let the principle of my choice be shown not only by my connections which i have set aside for you , but by your own
 the senate , led by its principal members , then framed a form of oath , which was eagerly taken by all the magistrates and by the other senators in the order in which they voted they called the gods to witness , that nothing had been done by their instrumentality to prejudice the safety of any person , and that they had gained no distinction or advantage by the ruin of roman citizens great was the alarm , and various the devices for altering the words of the oath , among those who felt the consciousness of guilt
 at the close of the year , caius lutorius priscus , a roman knight , who , after writing a popular poem bewailing the death of germanicus , had received a reward in money from the emperor , was fastened on by an informer , and charged with having composed another during the illness of drusus , which , in the event of the prince's death , might be published with even greater profit to himself he had in his vanity read it in the house of publius petronius before vitellia , petronius's mother-in-law , and several ladies of rank
alarmed by these tidings and letters , caesar levied two new legions in hither gaul , and , at the beginning of summer , sent quintus pedius , his legate , to conduct them further into gaul .
 thus three days were wasted in disputes and excuses . 
 he felt conscious that all men laughed at his late mock triumph over germany , for which there had been purchased from traders people whose dress and hair might be made to resemble those of captives , whereas now a real and splendid victory , with the destruction of thousands of the enemy , was being celebrated with just applause
 he disposed his soldiers on the works which he had begun , not at certain intervals , as was his practice before , but in one continued range of sentinels and stations , so that they touched each other , and formed a circle round the whole fortification ; he ordered the tribunes and general officers to ride round ; and exhorted them not only to be on their guard against sallies from the town , but also to watch that no single person should get out privately . 
 in one spot were pools of blood and heaps of corpses , and close by prostitutes and men of character as infamous there were all the debaucheries of luxurious peace , all the horrors of a city most cruelly sacked , till one was ready to believe the country to be mad at once with rage and lust it was not indeed the first time that armed troops had fought within the city
to him , when they have determined to engage in battle , they commonly vow those things which they shall take in war .
 though staggered by these apprehensions , he was confirmed in his purpose by others among the legates and among his own friends , and particularly by mucianus , who , after many conversations with him in private , now publicly addressed him in the following terms 
 tiberius then embraced him and congratulated him on foreseeing his dangers and on being quite safe taking what he had said as an oracle , he retained him in the number of his intimate friends
when he had arrived there , he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were marshaled on the other bank of the river ; the bank also was defended by sharp stakes fixed in front , and stakes of the same kind fixed under the water were covered by the river .
 this news was met with favourable comments , but it was heard with disgust that sejanus was to be the father-in-law of the son of claudius
 silana having now a prospect of vengeance , suborned as accusers two of her creatures , iturius and calvisius , not with the old and often-repeated charges about agrippina's mourning the death of britannicus or publishing the wrongs of octavia , but with a hint that it was her purpose to encourage in revolutionary designs rubellius plautus , who his mother's side was as nearly connected as nero with the divine augustus
 when these affairs were dispatched , caesar , sparing the town more out of regard to their renown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to his favor , left two legions in garrison there , sent the rest to italy , and set out himself for rome . 
 that it was through his treachery that they had been slaughtered , no reinforcements coming up
 he had made some impression by the nobleness of his example , when the slave girl recovered and revealed the truth
 he was to be tried on the other charges , a multitude of which were heaped on him , but his timely death cut short the trial
 with a politic prudence he refrained from demanding capital punishment in any case yet , fearing that he might lay himself more open to suspicion by concealment of his feelings , he censured a few persons , well aware that in civil wars the soldiers have more license than the generals
 and that he might not merely avail himself of the memory of a hated name to stir up strife , he had associated with him lucius silanus , a youth of noble birth and reckless spirit , to whom he might point as an instrument of revolution
 the man fixed on as the guilty lover was one by name eucaerus , an alexandrine by birth , skilled in singing to the flute
 the lower was under the charge of aulus caecina
 money was , however , voted from the exchequer , and though the use of the triumphal robe in the circus was prescribed , it was not allowed them to ride in a chariot
 on the morrow , as she was being dragged back on a chair to the same torments for with her limbs all dislocated she could not stand , she tied a band , which she had stript off her bosom , in a sort of noose to the arched back of the chair , put her neck in it , and then straining with the whole weight of her body , wrung out of her frame its little remaining breath all the nobler was the example set by a freedwoman at such a crisis in screening strangers and those whom she hardly knew , when freeborn men , roman knights , and senators , yet unscathed by torture , betrayed , every one , his dearest kinsfolk for even lucanus and senecio and quintianus failed not to reveal their accomplices indiscriminately , and nero was more and more alarmed , though he had fenced his person with a largely augmented guard
 when they perceived that caesar's camp was pitched , and the tents fixed up , and his horse sent out to forage , they suddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day , and , having hopes that we should be delayed by the absence of our horse , they began to march , which caesar perceiving , followed them with the legions that remained . 
 these arguments roused the indolent temper of the man , yet roused him rather to wish than to hope for the throne meanwhile however in upper germany caecina , young and handsome , of commanding stature , and of boundless ambition , had attracted the favour of the soldiery by his skilful oratory and his dignified mien
 occasionally even these hints were withheld , and , after urging them not to disturb the elections by canvassing , he would promise his own help towards the result
 but when we reached the river genusus , the banks being steep , their horse overtook our rear , and detained them by bringing them to action . 
 he therefore began with a panegyric on cluvius rufus , who , though not less rich nor less renowned for eloquence , had never imperilled a single life in the days of nero by this comparison , as well as by direct accusations , he pressed eprius hard , and stirred the indignation of the senators
 that will be enough for victory
and it so happened , that out of so large a number of ships , in so many voyages , neither in this nor in the previous year was any ship missing which conveyed soldiers ; but very few out of those which were sent back to him from the continent empty , as the soldiers of the former convoy had been disembarked , and out of those which labienus had taken care to have built , reached their destination ; almost all the rest were driven back , and when caesar had waited for them for some time in vain , lest he should be debarred from a voyage by the season of the year , inasmuch as the equinox was at hand , he of necessity stowed his soldiers the more closely , and , a very great calm coming on , after he had weighed anchor at the beginning of the second watch , he reached land at break of day and brought in all the ships in safety .
 it happened , too , that the quinquennial games were being celebrated for the second time , and the orators took from this same incident their chief materials for eulogies on the emperor
these things were reported to caesar by several persons .
 when the fortunes of vitellius began to totter , he attached himself to vespasian , and brought a vast accession of strength to his party he was brave in battle , ready of speech , dexterous in bringing odium upon other men , powerful amidst civil strife and rebellion , rapacious , prodigal , the worst of citizens in peace , but in war no contemptible ally
 the praetor was sent to question her at her own house , although the vestal virgins , according to ancient custom , were heard in the courts , before judges , whenever they gave evidence
 by this accident the eagle was preserved , but all the centurions of the first cohorts were killed , except the principal . 
 when does the rumour of the very choicest readings penetrate every part of rome , much less is talked of throughout our numerous provinces
 vitellius made similar overtures their tone was at first pacific and both exhibited a foolish and undignified hypocrisy then they seemed to quarrel , charging each other with debaucheries and the grossest crimes , and both spoke truth
 in the seclusion of rhodes he had habituated himself to shun society and to hide his voluptuous life
 then indeed , when intercepted from every road , he sends word to caesar , that he was ready to deliver up the legion which he commanded . 
 they fell upon our troops , which were scattered on garrison duty , stormed the forts , and burst into the colony itself , the head-quarters , as they thought , of tyranny
 vespasian's government had been infamous and odious the allies formed conjectures accordingly as to the manner in which each would reign , but the result contradicted them
that this might be affected if the aedui would lead their forces into the territories of the bellovaci , and begin to lay waste their country .
 as caecina was in doubt how he could possibly replace bridges which were ruinous from age , and at the same time hold back the enemy , he resolved to encamp on the spot , that some might begin the repair and others the attack
 such are the homes of the young , such the resting place of the old
 they were hidden away in different covered carriages till the orders of pharasmanes were distinctly ascertained
 caecina read the letter confidentially to the eagle and standardbearers , and to all in the camp who were least tainted by disloyalty , and urged them to save the whole army from disgrace , and themselves from destruction
 it was determined to seize the doubtful fortune of the hour , and to offer an emperor to their choice
 vonones was removed to pompeiopolis , a city on the coast of cilicia this was not merely a concession to the request of artabanus , but was meant as an affront to piso , who had a special liking for vonones , because of the many attentions and presents by which he had won plancina's favour
 it was only the charge of poisoning from which he seemed to have cleared himself this indeed the prosecutors did not adequately sustain by merely alleging that at a banquet given by germanicus , his food had been tainted with poison by the hands of piso who sat next above him
 it was in this same year that the cherusci asked rome for a king they had lost all their nobles in their civil wars , and there was left but one scion of the royal house , italicus by name , who lived at rome
 more thought it tiresome some were ready to throw him down and trample him under foot , had he not yielded to the warnings of the more orderly and the threats of others , and ceased to display his ill-timed wisdom
 but the fact is undoubted
 in the year of the consulship of caius vipstanus and caius fonteius , nero deferred no more a long meditated crime length of power had matured his daring , and his passion for poppaea daily grew more ardent as the woman had no hope of marriage for herself or of octavia's divorce while agrippina lived , she would reproach the emperor with incessant vituperation and sometimes call him in jest a mere ward who was under the rule of others , and was so far from having empire that he had not even his liberty
 by what kind of wisdom or maxims of philosophy had seneca within four years of royal favour amassed three hundred million sesterces
 for he reached the place before pompey could have notice of it ; and though the works were strong , yet having made the attack with the left wing which he commanded in person , he obliged the pompeians to quit the rampart in disorder . 
 anteius and ostorius were , he hinted , grasping at empire and prying into the destinies of themselves and of the prince
 now , a young noble of stately beauty , of vigorous intellect , with the near prospect of the consulship , is preparing himself for a loftier ambition
 it was accounted a portent that every order of magistrates had had its number reduced , a quaestor , an aedile , a tribune , a praetor and consul having died within a few months
 many were swept away in the streets , many more were cut off in their shops and chambers
but the enemy , as soon as they saw our horse , the number of which was 5000 , whereas they themselves had not more than 800 horse , because those which had gone over the meuse for the purpose of foraging had not returned , while our men had no apprehensions , because their embassadors had gone away from caesar a little before , and that day had been requested by them as a period of truce , made an onset on our men , and soon threw them into disorder .
 besides , the usual design of a siege is to cut off the enemy's supplies on the contrary , caesar , with an inferior force , was inclosing troops sound and unhurt , and who had abundance of all things . 
 like all novelties , it was variously canvassed there were some who declared that even cnius pompeius was censured by the older men of the day for having set up a fixed and permanent theatre
 that power is now your only refuge
 subsequently , antonius had been lured on by the treaties of tarentum and brundisium , and by his marriage with the sister , and paid by his death the penalty of a treacherous alliance
from these circumstances it resulted , that they could range less widely , and could less easily make war upon their neighbours ; for which reason men fond of war were affected with great regret .
 some roused their immediate neighbourhood
 meanwhile , appalled by the roar of the increasing sedition and by the shouts which reached the city , piso had overtaken galba , who in the interval had quitted the palace , and was approaching the forum
 they choose their kings by birth , their generals for merit
 didius , though he quickly arrived , found matters far from prosperous , for the legion under the command of manlius valens had meanwhile been defeated , and the disaster had been exaggerated by the enemy to alarm the new general , while he again magnified it , that he might win the more glory by quelling the movement or have a fairer excuse if it lasted
 these , with some other nobles whom they admitted to their counsels , as there was not a single arsacid whom they could put on the throne , most of the family having been murdered by artabanus or being under age , demanded that phraates , son of king phraates , should be sent from rome
 still they provide for the increase of their numbers
 often have i been present , senators , in this assembly when new decrees were demanded from us contrary to the customs and laws of our ancestors , and i have refrained from opposition , not because i doubted but that in all matters the arrangements of the past were better and fairer and that all changes were for the worse , but that i might not seem to be exalting my own profession out of an excessive partiality for ancient precedent
 already they had settled themselves in houses , had sown the fields , and were cultivating the soil as if it had been their ancestors' , when dubius avitus , who had succeeded paulinus in the province , by threatening them with a roman attack if they did not retire into their old country or obtain a new territory from the emperor , constrained verritus and malorix to become suppliants
 to him pompey applied to be permitted to take refuge in alexandria , and to be protected in his calamity by his powerful assistance , in consideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between his father and him . 
 in a distant part of the world fortune was now preparing the origin and rise of a new dynasty , whose varied destinies brought happiness or misery on the state , prosperity or destruction on the princes of its line
 to his soldiers he made a recompense in money for those things , a just valuation being made . 
 annius gallus was put at the head of this force , and was sent on with vestricius spurinna to occupy the banks of the padus , the original plan of the campaign having fallen to the ground , now that caecina , who they had hoped might have been kept within the limits of gaul , had crossed the alps
 be not frightened by idle display , by the glitter of gold and of silver , which can neither protect nor wound
 this camp joined a certain wood , and was not above four hundred paces distant from the sea . 
one avows that the camp is already taken , another maintains that , the enemy having destroyed the army and commander-in-chief , are come hither as conquerors ; most form strange superstitious fancies from the spot , and place before their eyes the catastrophe of cotta and titurius , who had fallen in the same fort .
 when nothing more was to be feared from the enemy , domitian came forward to meet the leaders of the party he was universally saluted by the title of caesar , and the troops , in great numbers , armed as they were , conducted him to his father's house
having advanced into the country of the nitiobriges , and gabali , he receives hostages from both nations , and , assembling a numerous force , marches to make a descent on the province in the direction of narbo .
 by this means the hope of curio were seconded by the ardor of the soldiers . 
 next , as several expeditions against tacfarinas had proved the uselessness of following up the enemy's desultory movements with the attack of heavy troops from a single point , he summoned to his aid king ptolemaeus and his people , and equipped four columns , under the command of his lieutenants and tribunes
 fear kept them away , and their crews were dispersed about other military duties
 the rest built their hopes on revolution
 meanwhile civilis had tried to work on the feelings of the besieged by representing that with the romans all was lost , and that victory had declared for his own troops
 without moment's delay , he seized the neighbouring governments , seleucia alone refusing his rule
 what their forefathers originated , posterity maintain
 he was prematurely advanced to the consulship by augustus , so that he might be raised by the honour of this promotion above labeo antistius , a conspicuous member of the same profession
 in their plundering expeditions they roam over the whole extent of forest and mountain between the peucini and fenni
 otho himself was accompanied by some picked men of the body-guard , with whom were the rest of the praetorian cohorts , the veteran troops from the praetorian camp , and a vast number of the levies raised from the fleet
 while caesar was measuring out his camp , he was told of a revolt of the angrivarii in his rear
having been apprised of the arrival of crassus by the scouts at about the third hour , he advances twenty miles that day .
 the report gained the more credit from the genius of titus himself , equal as it was to the most exalted fortune , from the mingled beauty and majesty of his countenance , from the prosperous fortunes of vespasian , from the prophetic responses of oracles , and even from accidental occurrences which , in the general disposition to belief , were accepted as omens
 they quitted the gates and restored to their places the standards which at the beginning of the mutiny they had grouped into one spot
 petreius and afranius divided this task between themselves , and went in person to some distance from their camp for the purpose of seeing it accomplished . 
 as he brought into the city his spanish legion , while that which nero had levied from the fleet still remained , rome was full of strange troops
 he had hastened to the baths to wash off the blood
 away they hurried hither and thither , altered men , and dragged the chief mutineers in chains to caius caetronius commander of the first legion , who tried and punished them one by one in the following fashion
 the soldiers of the 1st and of the 5th were so mutinous , that some of them threw stones at the images of galba
 again there was an outburst of flattery , men voting the honours of deification , of a shrine , a temple , and a priest
 the soldiers of the body-guard dispersed , but the rest of the cohort , who shewed no disrespect to the speaker , displayed their standards , acting , as often happens in a disturbance , on mere impulse and without any settled plan , rather than , as was afterwards believed , with treachery and an intention to deceive
 claudius equipped galleys with three and four banks of oars , and nineteen thousand men he lined the circumference of the lake with rafts , that there might be no means of escape at various points , but he still left full space for the strength of the crews , the skill of the pilots , the impact of the vessels , and the usual operations of a seafight
 while they thus hesitated , all usual and even unusual kinds of food failed them , for they had consumed their horses and beasts of burden and all the other animals , which , though unclean and disgusting , necessity compelled them to use
when the centurions in the town understood from the signal-making of the gauls that they were forming some new design , they drew their swords and seized the gates , and recovered all their men safe .
 after this no one retained any sense of duty , any recollection of his late allegiance , but , as usually happens in mutinies , the side of the majority became the side of all
 meanwhile the legions had an opportunity of retreating into what was called the old camp claudius labeo , prefect of the batavian horse , who had been the rival of civilis in some local contest , was sent away into the country of the frisii
 latin magistrates after plebeian
 letters likewise being sent by pompey through all the provinces and states , with an account of the action at dyrrachium , very much enlarged and exaggerated beyond the real facts , a rumor had been circulated , that caesar had been defeated and forced to flee , and had lost almost all his forces . 
 the resentment of the army had been inflamed against this officer by the belief , that it was he who had invented the charges and planned the treachery which had destroyed capito
 he was punished by quintilius varus then governor of syria , and the nation , with its liberties curtailed , was divided into three provinces under the sons of herod
 he was true to his word and several arrangements were made on the senate's authority
 driven from their purpose by the jealousy with which every one sought the chief honour for his own legion , they turned to other thoughts , and set up in one spot the three eagles , with the ensigns of the cohorts
 it was neither the close nor the distant fighting of a land-battle it was more like a naval contest struggling among the waters , or exerting every limb where they found any firm footing , the wounded and the unhurt , those who could swim and those who could not , were involved in one common destruction
 but when they found that it led to the river , and that nobody opposed them , they immediately climbed over the rampart , and were followed by all our cavalry . 
 but not a man murmured at the fatigue , because they imagined that there would be a period to all their toils , if they could cut off the enemy from the ebro and intercept their convoys . 
he at first strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should be left in gaul ; partly , because , being unaccustomed to sailing , he feared the sea ; partly because he said he was prevented by divine admonitions .
 these silius might enjoy only , he must give back the wife and annul the act of marriage
 by their vote the most turbulent men were elected
 nero , though he approved strabo's decision , wrote word that nevertheless he was for relieving the allies , and that he waived all claim to what had been taken into possession
the matter being reported to their countrymen , they said that they would execute his commands .
 meanwhile , with only three companions , so lonely did she find herself in a moment , she traversed the whole length of the city , and , mounting on a cart used to remove garden refuse , proceeded along the road to ostia not pitied , so overpoweringly hideous were her crimes , by a single person
 cerialis was generally censured for allowing them to unite , when he might have destroyed them in detail
 but when people once transgress prohibitions with impunity , there is no longer any fear or any shame
 if the enemy be rich , they are rapacious if he be poor , they lust for dominion
 the subjection of the mattiaci is of the same character
 he was indeed perpetually under the lash of popular talk , which said that he had destroyed men perfectly innocent out of jealousy or fear
 with this seemingly conciliatory speech he retained the substance of power
the helvetii having followed with all their wagons , collected their baggage into one place : they themselves , after having repulsed our cavalry and formed a phalanx , advanced up to our front line in very close order .
 over otho was built a tomb unpretending and therefore likely to stand
 about the same time the messenger despatched by civilis came up with the cohorts of the batavians and the canninefates , while by the orders of vitellius they were advancing towards rome
 panic-stricken by his disaster , those who ought to have given him support returned in precipitate flight to their respective encampments
 helvidius and paconius were banished from italy
 leave being granted him , he departed . 
 after tarquin's expulsion , the people , to check cabals among the senators , devised many safeguards for freedom and for the establishment of unity decemvirs were appointed everything specially admirable elsewhere was adopted , and the twelve tables drawn up , the last specimen of equitable legislation
 the soldiers of vitellius , dispersed through the municipal towns and colonies , were robbing and plundering and polluting every place with violence and lust
 otho was inclined to risk a decisive battle
 both spoke on the subject , and lepidus begged earnestly to be excused he alleged ill-health , his children's tender age , his having a daughter to marry , and something more of which he said nothing , was well understood , the fact that blaesus was uncle of sejanus and so had very powerful interest
 and now , bleeding from a blow , and feeling destruction certain , he was rescued by the hurried arrival of the throng which had accompanied drusus
 i have often heard this sort of talk from you , when , forgetting the eloquence of yourself and your brother , you argued that nobody in this age is an orator and you did this , i believe , with the more audacity because you were not afraid of a reputation for ill-nature , seeing that the glory which others concede to you , you deny to yourself
 the three first days caesar employed in fortifying his camp with strong works , in bringing in corn from the neighboring free towns , and waiting for the rest of his forces . 
 the armies of the east were so divided that half the auxiliaries and two legions were to remain in the province of syria under its governor , quadratus ummidius while corbulo was to have an equal number of citizen and allied troops , together with the auxiliary infantry and cavalry which were in winter quarters in cappadocia
 and so the cherusci , ever reputed good and just , are now called cowards and fools , while in the case of the victorious chatti success has been identified with prudence
 united as they now are with us by manners , education , and intermarriage , let them bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation
 authority was then given to the senate to decide the case of caecilianus , one of its members , the chief witness against cotta , and it was agreed that the same penalty should be inflicted as on aruseius and sanquinius , the accusers of lucius arruntius
 a host however of debtors and dependents took up arms , and they were on their way to the forest passes known as the arduenna , when they were stopped by legions which visellius and silius had sent from their respective armies , by opposite routes , to meet them
 valens received the tidings of the murder of galba and the accession of otho while he was in the country of the leuci
 my emperor , on the other hand , has undisturbed peace all around him , and this is his only war
 but caesar required that he should be allowed to send commissioners to pompey , who should suffer no personal injury ; and that either they should grant it , or should take his commissioners in charge , and convey them to pompey . 
 he distributed some gratuities , but sparingly , and not like a man who was soon to die
 then he went out into a colonnade , where he was found by the quaestor , joyful rather than otherwise , as he had learnt that helvidius , his son-in-law , was merely excluded from italy
when the action commenced , the enemy were unable to sustain the attack of our men long , and turned their backs ; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength permitted , and slew a great number of them ; then , having destroyed and burned every thing far and wide , they retreated to their camp .
 he lightened the exaction of corn and tribute by an equal distribution of the burden , while he got rid of those contrivances for gain which were more intolerable than the tribute itself
 vibidia he could not repel , when , with a vehemently indignant appeal , she demanded that a wife should not be given up to death without a hearing
 he avoided rivalry with his colleagues , contention with his procurator , thinking such victories no honour and defeat disgrace
 the insult fired the wrath of the legions
 all this was aggravated by the old vanity of caecina , and by the indolence that had of late crept over him presuming on the excessive favour of fortune , he had abandoned himself to luxury perhaps he meditated perfidy , and it was part of his policy to enervate the courage of the army
 the body of galba lay for a long time neglected , and subjected , through the license which the darkness permitted , to a thousand indignities , till argius his steward , who had been one of his slaves , gave it a humble burial in his master's private gardens
 letters were also addressed by fabius valens in the name of the german army to the praetorian and city cohorts , extolling the strength of his party , and offering terms of peace
 africanus dared not confess his guilt , and could not deny it but he himself turned on vibius crispus , who was pressing him with questions , and complicating a charge which he could not rebut , shifted the blame from himself by associating another with his guilt
 i will record the incident with the names , on the authority of vipstanus messalla
 then followed galba's speech in the senate , which was as plain and brief as his speech to the soldiery
 the 7th legion , recently levied by galba , was the hardest pressed
 his father , julius græcinus , a member of the senatorian order , and distinguished for his pursuit of eloquence and philosophy , earned for himself by these very merits the displeasure of caius cæsar
 the eagles supporting the pediment , which were of old timber , caught the flames
 tiberius's bodily powers were now leaving him , but not his skill in dissembling
 quadratus , learning that mithridates had been betrayed and that his kingdom was in the hands of his murderers , summoned a council , and , having informed them of what had occurred , consulted them whether he should take vengeance
 after him , senecio , quintianus , and scaevinus perished , not in the manner expected from the past effeminacy of their life , and then the remaining conspirators , without deed or word deserving record
they do what they were ordered ; and , making a sudden sally from all the gates , leave the enemy the means neither of knowing what was taking place , nor of collecting themselves .
 quintilius , making this a pretext for addressing them , began to go round curio's lines , and to entreat the soldiers not to lose all recollection of the oath which they took first to domitius and to him their quaestor , nor bear arms against those who had shared the same fortune , and endured the same hardships in a siege , nor fight for those by whom they had been opprobriously called deserters . 
 for he had even declared in council a few days before that , before the battalions came to battle , caesar's army would be put to the rout . 
 they turned to verginius , and in threatening language , at one time besought him to accept the imperial dignity , at another , to act as envoy to caecina and valens
 when they were assured of obtaining their demands , they promised that they would immediately remove their standards , and sent centurions of the first rank as deputies to treat with caesar about a peace .

 all this iturius and calvisius divulged to atimetus , a freedman of domitia , nero's aunt exulting in the opportunity , for agrippina and domitia were in bitter rivalry , atimetus urged paris , who was himself also a freedman of domitia , to go at once and put the charge in the most dreadful form
 for so far were they from deriving any assistance from their horse of which they had a large number , that they were obliged to receive them into the center of their army , and themselves protect them , as they were daunted by former battles . 
 antonius threw himself in the way with his sword drawn , protesting that he would die either by the soldiers' hands or by his own
 two legions , the eighth and the fifteenth , were actually drawing swords against each other , the former demanding the death of a centurion , whom they nicknamed sirpicus , while the men of the fifteenth defended him , but the soldiers of the ninth interposed their entreaties , and when these were disregarded , their menaces
 vitellius gave them credit for perfidy , and acquitted them of the crime of loyalty
 piso , after crossing the dalmatian sea and leaving his ships at ancona , went through picenum and along the flaminian road , where he overtook a legion which was marching from pannonia to rome and was then to garrison africa
 hence arose a sharp altercation between helvidius and eprius
and frequently it came to that point , as so large a body of cavalry had been sent abroad in all directions , that the prisoners declared ambiorix had just then been seen by them in flight , and had not even passed out of sight , so that the hope of overtaking him being raised , and unbounded exertions having been resorted to , those who thought they should acquire the highest favor with caesar , nearly overcame nature by their ardor , and continually , a little only seemed wanting to complete success ; but he rescued himself by lurking-places and forests , and , concealed by the night made for other districts and quarters , with no greater guard than that of four horsemen , to whom along he ventured to confide his life .
 all this capito cossutianus would not allow to be forgotten he had a heart eager for the worst wickedness , and he also bore ill-will to thrasea , the weight of whose influence had crushed him , while envoys from cilicia , supported by thrasea's advocacy , were accusing him of extortion
 at an interval of six hundred feet from that there was another rampart turned the contrary way , with the works lower . 
 when these occupy and possess the mind , how little room has it left for worthy attainments ! few indeed are to be found who talk of any other subjects in their homes , and whenever we enter a class-room , what else is the conversation of the youths
 none the less however was the mound piled up , and it was quite breast high when , at last overcome by his persistency , they gave up their purpose
caesar had every thing to do at one time : the standard to be displayed , which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms ; the signal to be given by the trumpet ; the soldiers to be called off from the works ; those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of seeking materials for the rampart , to be summoned ; the order of battle to be formed ; the soldiers to be encouraged ; the watchword to be given .
 tiberius used formerly in the name of augustus to frustrate the wishes of the legions , and the same tricks were now revived by drusus
 that the same thing was seen he was assured by those in the higher forts . 
 as if they were applauding a dictator like caesar , or an emperor like augustus , they vied with each other in their zeal and good wishes
 and that he might also soften the remembrance of the disaster by kindness , he went round to the wounded , applauded the feats of soldier after soldier , examined their wounds , raised the hopes of one , the ambition of another , and the spirits of all by his encouragement and interest , thus strengthening their ardour for himself and for battle
 there was law for the citizens
 nor was suetonius silent at such a crisis
 if freedmen were to be a separate class , the paucity of the freeborn would be conspicuously apparent
 caesar , having effected a junction with antonius's army , and having drawn his legion out of oricum , which he had left there to guard the coast , thought he ought to sound the inclination of the provinces , and march further into the country ; and when embassadors came to him from thessaly and aetolia , to engage that the states in those countries would obey his orders , if he sent a garrison to protect them , he dispatched lucius cassius longinus , with the twenty-seventh , a legion composed of young soldiers , and two hundred horse , to thessaly : and caius calvisius sabinus , with five cohorts , and a small party of horse , into aetolia . 
 fortune and i now know each other
 many were wrecked on distant islands , and the soldiers , finding there no form of human life , perished of hunger , except some who supported existence on carcases of horses washed on the same shores
 to these he added a vast number of boats he put in each three or four hundred men , the usual complement of a liburnian galley
 the rest of the country is broken rock and perfectly dry even if it could be cut through , the labour would be intolerable , and there would be no adequate result
 what if you were to assume that the temples of the present day are weaker , because , instead of being built of rough blocks and ill-shaped tiles , they shine with marble and glitter with gold
 a fourth part of every company might be scattered on furlough , or even loiter about the camp , provided that they paid the fees to the centurions
 tacfarinas accordingly spread rumours that elsewhere also nations were rending the empire of rome and that therefore her soldiers were gradually retiring from africa , and that the rest might be cut off by a strong effort on the part of all who loved freedom more than slavery he thus augmented his force , and having formed a camp , he besieged the town of thubuscum
after making these arrangements , he marches into the aedui , and recovers that state .
 some vascon infantry , levied by galba , which had by this time been sent for , heard the noise of the combatants as they approached the camp , attacked the rear of the preoccupied enemy , and spread a panic more than proportionate to their numbers , some believing that all the troops from novesium , others that all from mogontiacum , had come up
 soldiers went with him to the senate house he sent letters to the different armies , as though supreme power was now his , and showed hesitation only when he spoke in the senate
 i feel no penitence , said messala , for such talk , nor do i believe that secundus or maternus or you yourself , aper , think differently , though now and then you argue for the opposite view
 and accordingly they plundered each other , letting loose bands of robbers , forming ambuscades , and occasionally fighting battles , and carrying the spoil and booty to the two procurators , who at first rejoiced at all this , but , as the mischief grew , they interposed with an armed force , which was cut to pieces
 the soldiers under the protection of the vineae , finish this whole work to the very tower ; and suddenly , before the enemy were aware of it , moved it forward by naval machinery , by putting rollers under it , close up to the enemy's turret , so that it even touched the building . 
 but classicus hopes to wage with your strength his war against rome , and proudly offers to your allegiance an empire of gaul
 and if i had passed my years in arms , your sword and right hand would not have failed me
 they hurried at quick march past the forum and the temples which hang over it , and advanced their line up the opposite hill as far as the outer gates of the capitol
 even calvus , although he has left , i think , one-and-twenty volumes , scarcely satisfies me in one or two short speeches
the following winter , those germans the usipetes , and likewise the tencteri , with a great number of men , crossed the rhine , not far from the place at which that river discharges itself into the sea .
 to make matters worse , the organisation of the service was deranged by unprincipled intrigue and favour
camulogenus , the general of the enemy , was present and encouraged his troops .
 he granted a consul's decorations to nymphidius , on whose origin , as he now appears for the first time , i will briefly touch
 both armies fought with the same weapons the watch-word , continually asked , became known the colours were confused together , as parties of combatants snatched them from the enemy , and hurried them in this or that direction
 caius sulpicius and didius haterius were the next consuls
 meanwhile the operations of vespasian were hastened by the zeal of the army of illyricum , which had come over to his side
when several days had elapsed in winter quarters , and he had ordered corn to be brought in he was suddenly informed by his scouts that all the people had gone off in the night from that part of the town which he had given up to the gauls , and that the mountains which hung over it were occupied by a very large force of the seduni and veragri .
 for hardships may be endured , whereas we are spoiled by success
 these men charged suilius with having driven quintus pomponius by a relentless prosecution into the extremity of civil war , with having forced julia , drusus's daughter , and sabina poppaea to suicide , with having treacherously ruined valerius asiaticus , lusius saturninus and cornelius lupus , in fact , with the wholesale conviction of troops of roman knights , and with all the cruelty of claudius
 it cannot be moved by the wind , and it affords no home either to fish or water-birds
 otho , who was overcome , not indeed by skilful generalship , or by a powerful enemy , but by his own premature despair , this man has made into a great and deservedly regretted emperor , and all the while he is disbanding his legions , disarming his auxiliaries , and sowing every day fresh seeds of civil war
 to these he added the 12th from syria , and some men belonging to the 18th and 3rd , whom he had withdrawn from alexandria
 few had any discrimination or patriotism , many had foolish hopes for themselves , and spread interested reports , in which they named this or that person to whom they might be related as friend or dependant they were also moved by hatred of t vinius , who grew daily more powerful , and in the same proportion more unpopular
 he was dragged off to a place set apart for the execution of slaves , and butchered by the hand of the tribune statius , maintaining a resolute silence , and not reproaching the tribune with complicity in the plot
 lucius volusius on the other hand died with a glorious name there was his long life of ninety-three years , his conspicuous wealth , honourably acquired , and his wise avoidance of the malignity of so many emperors
 the pharos is a tower on an island , of prodigious height , built with amazing works , and takes its name from the island . 
the furthest town of the allobroges , and the nearest to the territories of the helvetii , is geneva .
 the inhabitants of apollonia sent embassadors to caesar , and gave him admission into their town . 
 in two days after this transaction , there happened an unexpected misfortune . 
to the state moreover the occasion of the war was this-that it could not withstand the sudden combination of the gauls ; that he could easily prove this from his own weakness , since he was not so little versed in affairs as to presume that with his forces he could conquer the roman people ; but that it was the common resolution of gaul ; that that day was appointed for the storming of all caesar's winter-quarters , in order that no legion should be able to come to the relief of another legion , that gauls could not easily deny gauls , especially when a measure seemed entered into for recovering their common freedom .
 it was he , they said , who had singled out as victims for nero the brothers scribonius , renowned for their mutual affection and for their wealth
 in the bewilderment of terror and conscious guilt they were penetrated by an apprehension that persons had come at the senate's orders to cancel the concessions they had extorted by mutiny
the following day , having led forth their cavalry from the camp , they fill all that plain , which , we have related , extended three miles in length , and drew out their infantry a little from that place , and post them on the higher ground .
 wherefore they should , by all means , attempt to force their way by day ; for , though a trifling loss might be sustained , yet the post which they desired might be secured with safety to the main body of the army . 
 but they soon quarreled about the command , which circumstance enlarged the presents to the soldiers , for each endeavored by great sacrifices to secure their affection . 
 nor even afterwards had we the same temptations , while our dominion was confined to italy
 but the allobroges , who were in the retinue of aegus and roscillus , and who had deserted to pompey , having met on the road a scouting party of domitius ; either from old acquaintance , because they had served together in gaul , or elated with vain glory , gave them an account of all that had happened , and informed them of caesar's departure , and pompey's arrival . 
they on no account permit wine to be imported to them , because they consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring fatigue , and are rendered effeminate by that commodity .
 one of these , publius celer , prosecuted by the province of asia , the emperor could not acquit , and so he put off the case till the man died of old age
 tiberius had by this time filled the island with twelve country houses , each with a grand name and a vast structure of its own
 accordingly one of the imperial freedmen , polyclitus , was sent to survey the state of britain , nero having great hopes that his influence would be able not only to establish a good understanding between the governor and the pro-curator , but also to pacify the rebellious spirit of the barbarians
 next day , when he was dragged back to torture , he broke loose from his guards and dashed his head against a stone with such violence that he instantly fell dead
 upon news of caesar's approach , the senate of auximum went in a body to attius varus ; and told him that it was not a subject for them to determine upon : yet neither they , nor the rest of the freemen would suffer caius caesar , a general , who had merited so well of the republic , after performing such great achievements , to be excluded from their town and walls ; wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion of posterity , and his own danger . 
 they were called crupellarii , and though they were ill-adapted for inflicting wounds , they were impenetrable to them
our men , attacking in the river the disordered enemy , slew a great part of them by the immense number of their missiles they drove back the rest , who , in a most courageous manner were attempting to pass over their bodies , and surrounded with their cavalry , and cut to pieces those who had first crossed the river .
 manlius valens , legate of the italian legion , though he had served the party well , was held in no honour by vitellius
 the egyptians also claim to have invented the alphabet , which the phoenicians , they say , by means of their superior seamanship , introduced into greece , and of which they appropriated the glory , giving out that they had discovered what they had really been taught
 then came a letter from tiberius against sextus vestilius , an ex-praetor , whom , as a special favourite of his brother drusus , the emperor had admitted into his own select circle
 the end of these harangues was that 5000 sesterces were paid to each soldier
 and shortly afterwards , a foraging party of our men , with some cavalry squadrons sent to their support , was utterly routed
 there he bore patiently the renewal of the accusation , the furious voices of the senators , savage opposition indeed from every quarter , but nothing daunted him so much as to see tiberius , without pity and without anger , resolutely closing himself against any inroad of emotion
 that age indeed produced at one time two brilliant ornaments of peace
 after this otho sent flavius sabinus , consul elect , to take the command of the troops which had been under macer the soldiers were delighted by this change of generals , while the generals were led by these continual outbreaks to regard with disgust so hateful a service
 scaurus by the remark that there was a hope that the senate's prayers would not be fruitless , seeing that he had not used his right as tribune to negative the motion of the consuls
for in what was that war like this ? the cimbri , after laying gaul waste , and inflicting great calamities , at length departed from our country , and sought other lands ; they left us our rights , laws , lands , and liberty .
 fame itself , of which even good men are often weakly fond , he did not seek by an ostentation of virtue or by artifice
 the body of sabinus , pierced and mutilated and with the head severed from it , was dragged to the gemoniae
he left what seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that design ; he himself proceeds into the territories of the treveri with four legions without baggage , and 800 horse , because they neither came to the general diets , nor obeyed his commands , and were moreover , said to be tampering with the germans beyond the rhine .
 while he was celebrating his birthday without a fear , he was hurried before the senate , condemned and instantly put to death his sister sancia was outlawed , on the accusation of quintus pomponius , a restless spirit , who pretended that he employed himself in this and like practices to win favour with the sovereign , and thereby alleviate the perils hanging over his brother pomponius secundus
 julius martialis was the tribune on guard in the camp
 shortly afterwards the enemy retreated
 comrade , replied galba , who gave the order
 in answer to these and like arguments claudius began to speak of the grandeur of rome and the submissive attitude of the parthians he compared himself to the divine augustus , from whom , he reminded them , they had sought a king , but omitted to mention tiberius , though he too had sent them sovereigns
one angle of this side , which is in kent , whither almost all ships from gaul are directed , to the east ; the lower looks to the south .
 there was now no doubt about the feeling of all the troops in the camp so great was their zeal , that , not content with surrounding otho with their persons in close array , they elevated him to the pedestal , on which a short time before had stood the gilt statue of galba , and there , amid the standards , encircled him with their colours
 let it be known to those whose habit it is to admire the disregard of authority , that there may be great men even under bad emperors , and that obedience and submission , when joined to activity and vigour , may attain a glory which most men reach only by a perilous career , utterly useless to the state , and closed by an ostentatious death
 this was the first token of mischief nor was it long delayed silanus was coupled with cassius , no crime being alleged , but that cassius was eminent for his ancestral wealth and dignity of character , silanus for the nobility of his birth and the quiet demeanour of his youth
 in their rage and their triumph , they spared no variety of a barbarian's cruelty
 about the same time news came to vitellius that the procurator albinus had fallen , and that both the provinces of mauritania had declared for him
 i do not find in any historian or in the daily register that antonia , germanicus's mother , rendered any conspicuous honour to the deceased , though besides agrippina , drusus , and claudius , all his other kinsfolk are mentioned by name she may either have been hindered by illness , or with a spirit overpowered by grief she may not have had the heart to endure the sight of so great an affliction
 an act that had been long desired was taken by a flattering construction for more than it was worth , when antonius gave orders that the statues of galba , which had been thrown down during the troubles of the times , should be restored in all the towns it would , he supposed , reflect honour on the cause , if it were thought that they had been friendly to galba's rule , and that his party was again rising into strength
 he alleged against marcellus that he had made some disrespectful remarks about tiberius , a charge not to be evaded , inasmuch as the accuser selected the worst features of the emperor's character and grounded his case on them
 they choose dark nights for battle , and , by the dread and gloomy aspect of their death-like host , strike terror into the foe , who can never confront their strange and almost infernal appearance
 this loss too had been inflicted on us by the silures , and they were scouring the country far and wide , till didius hurried up and dispersed them
 yet the state had been organized under the name neither of a kingdom nor a dictatorship , but under that of a prince
 before the murder of flaccus hordeonius nothing had come out by which any conspiracy could be discovered
 poison at first seemed best , but , were it to be administered at the imperial table , the result could not be referred to chance after the recent circumstances of the death of britannicus
 the soldiers who had been posted on the wall to guard it , were called off by the signal which had been agreed on , and knowing the roads , ran down to the ships . 
 when we plead for a province , is it not one that has been plundered and ill-treated
 but the emperor , clinging all the more obstinately to the harshness with which he had been reproached in regard to accused persons , punished aquilia with exile for the crime of adultery with varius ligur , although lentulus gaetulicus , the consul-elect , had proposed that she should be sentenced under the julian law he next struck off apidius merula from the register of the senate for not having sworn obedience to the legislation of the divine augustus
 some little joy broke this long succession of horrors caius cominius , a roman knight , was spared by the emperor , against whom he was convicted of having written libellous verses , at the intercession of his brother , who was a senator
 everywhere was heard the confused shouting of men who were joining the ranks , or calling to their comrades , and each , as he was prompted by courage or by cowardice , rushed on to the front , or slunk back to the rear
 he recommended them to be especially careful to provide corn , because those regions were nearest to him he ordered cneius domitius calvinus to march into macedonia with two legions , the eleventh and twelfth , and five hundred horse ; from which province , menedemus , the principal man of those regions , on that side which is called the free , having come as embassador , assured him of the most devoted affection of all his subjects . 
when he had received the hostages , he leads back the army to the sea , and finds the ships repaired .
 antonius , as he hurried with the veteran soldiers of the cohorts and part of the cavalry to invade italy , was accompanied by arrius varus , an energetic soldier service under corbulo , and successes in armenia , had gained for him this reputation
 tiberius meanwhile in the name of germanicus gave every one of the city populace three hundred sesterces , and nominated himself his colleague in the consulship
 but before people had laid aside their fears , the flames returned , with no less fury this second time , and especially in the spacious districts of the city
 he advised martialis to depart unobserved through a concealed part of the palace , lest he should be killed by the soldiers , as the negotiator of this abhorred convention
 this island lying over against alexandria , forms a harbor ; but on the upper side it is connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred paces in length , made by piles sunk in the sea , and by a bridge . 
 it was however believed that piso was treacherously murdered by the termestini
 there was not a wound among our soldiers , who cut down a half-asleep , an unarmed , or a straggling foe
 only the other day the rebel turoni had been discomfited by a single cohort , the treveri by one cavalry squadron , the sequani by a few companies of this very army
 verginius secretly departed by a back way from his house , and thus managed to elude them when they burst in
 piso , who was the son of m crassus and scribonia , and thus of noble descent on both sides , was in look and manner a man of the old type rightly judged , he seemed a stern man , morose to those who estimated him less favourably
 and soon the common people , whom he had held under a harsh sway , heaped insults on him with menacing gestures , though some , on the contrary , pitied such a reverse of fortune
 then by one and the same stroke they sundered with a dagger the arteries of their arms seneca , as his aged frame , attenuated by frugal diet , allowed the blood to escape but slowly , severed also the veins of his legs and knees
 at the outposts , on guard , in the duties of day and of night , they were always to be under arms
 iturum ad signa et effigies principis , ubi legionibus coram regnum auspicaretur
 a few to a mean spirit
 at the same time , there were engagements in two other places ; for pompey had attacked several forts at once , in order to divide our forces ; that no relief might be sent from the neighboring posts . 
it is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth , except in council .
 for these reasons , each of them studied dispatch , that he might succor his friends , and not miss an opportunity of surprising his enemies . 
 this enraged the enemy , who were stung with shame at the prospect of falling under the dominion of a woman
he orders him to visit as many states as he could , and persuade them to embrace the protection of the roman people , and apprize them that he would shortly come thither .
volusenus , having viewed the localities as far as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship and trust himself to barbarians , returns to caesar on the fifth day , and reports what he had there observed .
 he explained that a vessel could be constructed , from which a part might by a contrivance be detached , when out at sea , so as to plunge her unawares into the water
 we may , indeed , make allowance for caius julius cæsar , on account of his vast schemes and many occupations , for having achieved less in eloquence than his divine genius demanded from him , and leave him indeed , just as we leave brutus to his philosophy
 but in the senate he maintained that philip had not been so formidable to the athenians , or pyrrhus or antiochus to the roman people , as was maroboduus
the cavalry unanimously shout out , that they ought to bind themselves by a most sacred oath , that he should not be received under a roof , nor have access to his children , parents , or wife , who shall not twice have ridden through the enemy's army .
 and now that this war had proved the zealous loyalty of ptolemaeus , a custom of antiquity was revived , and one of the senators was sent to present him with an ivory sceptre and an embroidered robe , gifts anciently bestowed by the senate , and to confer on him the titles of king , ally , and friend
 many had their rank restored to them , sentences of degradation were cancelled , and marks of disgrace partially removed
 difficult by-roads and distant places were fixed for them , so that states with a winter-camp close to them had to carry corn to remote and inaccessible parts of the country , until what was within the reach of all became a source of profit to the few
 his army being safe on the opposite bank , he drew out his forces and resolved to lead them forward in three battalions : and so great was the ardor of the soldiers that , notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six miles and a considerable delay in fording the river , before the ninth hour of the day they came up with those who had set out at the third watch . 
fabius , the lieutenant , ordering him to lead forth his legion into the territories of the atrebates , to which he knew his march must be made .
 tutor , classicus , and civilis , each at his post , animated the combatants the gauls they urged to fight for freedom , the batavi for glory , the germans for plunder
 they let nothing be kept secret , nothing be closed
 i am ashamed to quote the names of freedmen who parade a greater wealth
 one after another , on the destruction of a brother , a kinsman , or a friend , would return thanks to the gods , deck his house with laurels , prostrate himself at the knees of the emperor , and weary his hand with kisses
the length of this side , as their account states , is 700 miles .
 yet as even bodily disorders of long standing and growth can be checked only by sharp and painful treatment , so the fever of a diseased mind , itself polluted and a pollution to others , can be quenched only by remedies as strong as the passions which inflame it
 then drawing a fortification from one fort to another , as the nature of each position allowed , he began to draw a line of circumvallation round pompey , with these views ; as he had but a small quantity of corn , and pompey was strong in cavalry , that he might furnish his army with corn and other necessaries from all sides with less danger ; secondly , to prevent pompey from foraging , and thereby render his horse ineffectual in the operations of the war ; and thirdly , to lessen his reputation , on which he saw he depended greatly , among foreign nations , when a report should have spread throughout the world that he was blockaded by caesar , and dare not hazard a battle . 
 the cavalry charged , but , received by the orderly array of the enemy , fled to their own lines
whereupon assembling the centurions , he quickly gives orders to the soldiers to discontinue the fight a short time , and only collect the weapons flung , and recruit themselves after their fatigue , and afterward , upon the signal being given , sally forth from the camp , and place in their valor all their hope of safety .
 as for his early speeches , they are not free from the faults of antiquity
 reverence also in other ways is paid to the grove
 fear at home had filled their hearts , and for this they sought relief in sycophancy
the influence of this state is by far the most considerable of any of the countries on the whole sea coast , because the veneti both have a very great number of ships , with which they have been accustomed to sail to britain , and excel the rest in their knowledge and experience of nautical affairs ; and as only a few ports lie scattered along that stormy and open sea , of which they are in possession , they hold as tributaries almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in that sea .
 it was the case of a lofty and aspiring soul craving with more eagerness than caution the beauty and splendour of great and glorious renown
 they had great plenty of it ; loaves made of this , when pompey's men upbraided ours with want , they frequently threw among them to damp their hopes . 
 upon this the tencteri , a tribe separated by the rhine from the colony , sent envoys with orders to make known their instructions to the senate of the agrippinenses
 he had made two bridges over the river segre , at the distance of four miles from each other . 
 we have the river padus on our front , and cities strongly garrisoned and fortified , none of which will surrender to the enemy , as the defence of placentia has proved
 in the mean time , lucius nasidius , being sent by cneius pompey with a fleet of sixteen sail , a few of which had beaks of brass , to the assistance of lucius domitius and the massilians , passed the straits of sicily without the knowledge or expectation of curio , and , putting with his fleet into messana , and making the nobles and senate take flight with the sudden terror , carried off one of their ships out of dock . 
 still , that is not a reason for sending no one into a province
the young men harden themselves with this exercise , and practice themselves in this kind of hunting , and those who have slain the greatest number of them , having produced the horns in public , to serve as evidence , receive great praise .
 at this the emperor's wrath blazed forth , and , breaking through his habitual silence , he exclaimed that in such a case he would himself too give his vote openly on oath , that the rest might be under the same obligation
 every place having been completely destroyed , the army was marching in regular order on aventicum , the capital town , when a deputation was sent to surrender the city
 meanwhile the britons , wandering amidst the mingled wailings of men and women , were dragging off their wounded , calling to the unhurt , deserting their homes , and in their rage actually firing them , choosing places of concealment only instantly to abandon them
 he left two cohorts to guard the camp . 
 their country , though somewhat various in appearance yet generally either bristles with forests or reeks with swamps
as this village was divided into two parts by a river , he granted one part of it to the gauls , and assigned the other , which had been left by them unoccupied , to the cohorts to winter in .
 let us not revolutionise a wisely devised and ever approved system
 from them the fire passed to the colonnades adjoining the temples
when he had done this , the next day , thinking that he had done enough to lower the pride of the gauls , and to encourage the minds of his soldiers , he moved his camp in the direction of the aedui .
 the favour thus infamously acquired made him a centurion of the first rank , yet the ill-gotten prosperity of the moment afterwards turned to his destruction
 for at first that nation zealously supported the cause of rome soon indeed as the germans increased in power , many of the states took up arms against us , moved by the hope of freedom and , could they once shake off the yoke , even by the lust of empire
 caecina , grievously offended , determined to throw everything into confusion , and under the disasters of his country to conceal his private dishonour
 there britannicus was dining , and as what he ate and drank was always tested by the taste of a select attendant , the following device was contrived , that the usage might not be dropped or the crime betrayed by the death of both prince and attendant
 his words were brief and heard without exultation
 therefore , for the present he relinquished all intention of pursuing pompey , and resolved to march to spain , and commanded the magistrates of the free towns to procure him ships , and to have them convoyed to brundusium . 
 as it is , we have been long reduced to a position , in which my age confer no greater boon on the roman people than a good successor , your youth no greater than a good emperor
 while nero was reclining at dinner in his house named sublaqueum on the simbruine lake , the table with the banquet was struck and shattered , and as this happened close to tibur , from which town plautus derived his origin on his father's side , people believed him to be the man marked out by divine providence and he was encouraged by that numerous class , whose eager and often mistaken ambition it is to attach themselves prematurely to some new and hazardous cause
 he , on his part , urged various considerations , the greatness of the empire , his distrust of himself
 thereupon sentius ordered the horns and trumpets to be sounded , the rampart to be assaulted , the scaling ladders to be raised , all the bravest men to mount on them , while others were to discharge from the engines spears , stones , and brands
 when caesar came to brundusium , he made a speech to the soldiers : that since they were now almost arrived at the termination of their toils and dangers , they should patiently submit to leave their slaves and baggage in italy , and to embark without luggage , that a greater number of men might be put on board : that they might expect every thing from victory and his liberality . 
 this they count their strongest bond of union , these their sacred mysteries , these their gods of marriage
to him , in his turn , when surrounded , pullo brings relief ; and both having slain a great number , retreat into the fortifications amid the highest applause .
 he also allowed the ashes of lollia paulina to be brought back and a tomb to be built over them

 it is a fact that , whether suggested by real poverty or by a wish to give the appearance of it , a proposition passed the senate to the effect that a loan of sixty million sesterces from private persons should be accepted
diviciacus , embracing caesar , begins to implore him , with many tears , that he would not pass any very severe sentence upon his brother ; saying , that he knows that those charges are true , and that nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did ; for when he himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and in the rest of gaul , and he very little on account of his youth , the latter had become powerful through his means , which power and strength he used not only to the lessening of his popularity , but almost to his ruin ; that he , however , was influenced both by fraternal affection and by public opinion .

 after the army of britain had joined him , vitellius , who had now a prodigious force and vast resources , determined that there should be two generals and two lines of march for the contemplated war
 while he thus lay wasting his powers in sloth among the woods of aricia , he was startled by the treachery of lucilius bassus and the defection of the fleet at ravenna

 the spectators hailed the act goodnaturedly , as due to the impulsiveness of a primitive people and to an honourable rivalry

the shield of pullo is pierced and a javelin is fastened in his belt .
 the rest he had weakened by indiscriminate furloughs , till it was heard that vologeses was approaching with a powerful force bent on war
 caesar , having marched his legions over , halted before the town and encamped close by the walls . 
 and the soldiers in like manner are either diligent or lax in their duty
 he then penetrated to the remoter parts of the province of asia , visited the thracian cities , perinthus and byzantium next , the narrow strait of the propontis and the entrance of the pontus , from an anxious wish to become acquainted with those ancient and celebrated localities

 they censured the delusion and recklessness of the armies , and with a prudent circumlocution avoided the name of vespasian a man was found , who , while all regarded with great contempt both giver and receiver , wormed himself by flattery into the one day of office which remained to complete the consulate of caecina
 many , on the other hand , endeavoured to make the number of children weigh most in favour of the candidates
the senones , however , which is a state eminently powerful and one of great influence among the gauls , attempting by general design to slay cavarinus , whom caesar had created king among them , when he discovered their plot and fled , pursued him even to the frontiers , and drove him from his kingdom and his home ; and , after having sent embassadors to caesar for the purpose of concluding a peace , when he ordered all their senate to come to him , did not obey that command .
they appoint over their forces vergasillaunus , the arvernian , one of the four generals , and a near relative of vercingetorix .
the gauls had scattered archers and light-armed infantry here and there , among their cavalry , to give relief to their retreating troops , and sustain the impetuosity of our cavalry .

 almost the whole army being daunted at this , because it had occurred contrary to their expectations and custom , caesar encouraged his men and led the ninth legion to their relief , and checked the insolent and eager pursuit of the enemy , and obliged them , in their turn , to show their backs , and retreat to ilerda , and take post under the walls . 
 epicharis accordingly said more , and began the history of all the emperor's crimes
 in this levy valens ventured to do more than his rival on the pretence of his having rescued caecina himself from peril
to this was added , that dumnorix had before said in an assembly of aeduans , that the sovereignty of the state had been made over to him by caesar ; which speech the aedui bore with impatience and yet dared not send embassadors to caesar for the purpose of either rejecting or deprecating .
 vying with each other in an insolence of language proportioned to their cowardice of heart , they assailed with various accusations annius gallus , suetonius paullinus , and marius celsus
caesar , after taking many of their towns , perceiving that so much labor was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be prevented on the capture of their towns , and that injury could not be done them , he determined to wait for his fleet .

they arrange the other measures , and the manner in which they should have them done .
 the roman general accordingly dealt variously with them he was merciful to suppliants , swift in pursuit of fugitives , pitiless towards those who had crept into hiding-places , burning them out after filling up the entrances and exits with brushwood and bushes

 many positively asserted that by nero's order his throat was smeared with some poisonous drug under the pretence of the application of a remedy , and that burrus , who saw through the crime , when the emperor paid him a visit , recoiled with horror from his gaze , and merely replied to his question , i indeed am well
 but he broke the order , and on the arrival of a few cavalry squadrons from the nearest forts , who in their inexperience insisted on fighting , he engaged the enemy and was routed

 the rage first excited against the sequani and aedui extended to other states in proportion to their wealth , and they revelled in imagination on the storm of cities , the plunder of estates , the sack of dwelling-houses but , besides the rapacity and arrogance which are the special faults of superior strength , they were exasperated by the bravadoes of the gallic people , who in a spirit of insult to the army boasted of how they had been relieved by galba from a fourth part of their tribute , and had received grants from the state
 the vitellianists rashly left their position , and seeing celsus gradually give way , followed too far in pursuit , and themselves fell into an ambuscade
 but why should i omit to mention my own diligence and good fortune , and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived ? are you sorry that i transported the army safe and entire , without the loss of a single ship ? that on my arrival , in the very first attack , i routed the enemy's fleet ? that twice in two days i defeated the enemy's horse ? that i carried out of the very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy's victualers , and reduced them to that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or sea ? will you divorce yourselves from this fortune and these generals ; and prefer the disgrace of corfinium , the defeat of italy , the surrender of both spains , and the prestige of the african war ? i , for my part , wished to be called a soldier of caesar's ; you honored me with the title of imperator . 
 a vague rumour thus arose , or was intentionally suggested by the general , that mucianus had arrived , and that the two armies had exchanged salutations

 caecina indeed was not so rapacious as he was fond of popularity
 all the bravest of the batavians , of the infantry at least , fell , but the cavalry escaped with the standards and with the prisoners whom they had secured in the early part of the engagement
 even vitellius himself did not refrain from threatening words and gestures , till at length claudius cossus , one of the helvetian envoys , a man of well-known eloquence , but who then concealed the art of the orator under an assumption of alarm , and was therefore more effective , soothed the rage of the soldiers , who , like all multitudes , were liable to sudden impulses , and were now as inclined to pity as they had been extravagant in fury
 patrols , sentries , and whatever else the needs of the time required , were distributed by the men themselves

 i should say nothing of the adjournment of public business in this year , if it were not worth while to notice the conflicting opinions of cneius piso and asinius gallus on the subject

 this army was continually increased , not yet by any open combination of the neighbouring states , but by zealous individual enthusiasm , as well as by strife between the roman generals , each of whom claimed the war for himself

 many among them he distinguished with prefectures and governments , and several with the honours of senatorial rank
 the bloodshed then had not been less , but now there was an unnatural recklessness , and men's pleasures were not interrupted even for a moment
 the gallic auxiliaries were sent back to their respective states , a vast body of men , which in the very earliest stage of the revolt had been employed to make an idle show of strength
 men and women showed equal resolution , and life seemed more terrible than death , if they were to be forced to leave their country
 civilis , thinking that he must proceed by craft , actually blamed the prefects for having deserted the forts , saying that he would himself , with the cohort under his command , quell the disturbance among the canninefates , and that they had better return to their respective winter quarters
 the rest indeed did not express their opinions , but the name of marcellus , exposed as it was to odium from the hateful recollection of his career as an informer , had roused in caecina , who was an unknown man , and had lately been made a senator , the hope of distinguishing himself by making great enemies
 instantly , with a shout and sudden rush , our men threw themselves on the german rear , with taunts , that here were no woods or swamps , but that they were on equal ground , with equal chances the sound of trumpets , the gleam of arms , which were so unexpected , burst with all the greater effect on the enemy , thinking only , as they were , of the easy destruction of a few half-armed men , and they were struck down , as unprepared for a reverse as they had been elated by success
 only the conquered
 next followed a deliberation about funeral honours
 and do not dread what may present the semblance of flattery
 to these was added a public thanksgiving , and a temple was decreed to the goddess of fecundity , as well as games and contests after the type of the ceremonies commemorative of actium , and golden images of the two fortunes were to be set up on the throne of jupiter of the capitol shows too of the circus were to be exhibited in honour of the claudian and domitian families at antium , like those at bovillae in commemoration of the julii
when the appointed day came , the carnutes , under the command of cotuatus and conetodunus , desperate men , meet together at genabum , and slay the roman citizens who had settled there for the purpose of trading , and plunder their property .
 they did not refrain from abuse or actual violence
 against them curio detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the marrucini , whose first charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand , but , setting spurs to their horses , fled back to their friends : the light-infantry being deserted by those who had come out along with them , were surrounded and cut to pieces by our men . 
 of these the most imposing were thought fitting the procession was to be conducted through the gate of triumph , on the motion of gallus asinius
 the power of the legates grew through their lengthened tenure of office , and , perhaps , because an inferior feels greater interest in such a competition all the more distinguished of the proconsuls cared more for security than for power
 on the right was the 8th legion , drawn up in an open space , and then the 3rd , whose ranks were divided by some thick brushwood
 hordeonius flaccus , the consular legate , was present and witnessed this outrage , but he dared neither check the furious mutineers , nor keep the wavering to their duty , nor encourage the well affected
thereupon the engagement was renewed , and all the enemy turned their backs , nor did they cease to flee until they arrived at the river rhine , about fifty miles from that place .
 he then assumed a show of reconciliation with his father , to whom he returned , telling him all that could be accomplished by treachery was now ready and that he must complete the affair by the sword
 the nobility of his birth and the perils of the times made what was really indolence pass for wisdom
but the intervals which we have mentioned , are closed up in front by large stones .
 many a war , formidable in its first impetuosity , has passed into nothing through the weariness of delay
 natalis was therefore summoned , and they were separately asked what the conversation was , and what was its subject then a suspicion arose because their answers did not agree , and they were both put in irons they could not endure the sight and the threat of torture natalis however , taking the initiative , knowing as he did more of the whole conspiracy , and being also more practised in accusing , first confessed about piso , next added the name of annaeus seneca , either as having been a messenger between him and piso , or to win the favour of nero , who hated seneca and sought every means for his ruin then scaevinus too , when he knew the disclosure of natalis , with like pusillanimity , or under the impression that everything now divulged , and that there could be no advantage in silence , revealed the other conspirators
 at the shout that announced this success , the legions charged in front the germans were routed , and fled towards the rhine
 so , to forestall the danger , let the story be true or false , he hurried by the bays of torone and thermae , then passed on to euboea , an island of the aegaean , to piraeus , on the coast of attica , thence to the shores of corinth and the narrow isthmus , and having arrived by the other sea at nicopolis , a roman colony , he there at last ascertained that the man , when skilfully questioned , had said that he was the son of marcus silanus , and that , after the dispersion of a number of his followers' he had embarked on a vessel , intending , it seemed , to go to italy
 persons actually present attest both facts , even now when nothing is to be gained by falsehood
 caecina ridiculed his colleague as a man of foul and infamous character
 i pass now to the forms and character of procedure in the old courts
the gaul apprehending danger , throws his spear as he has been directed .
 curio had set out at the fourth watch with all his forces , except five cohorts which he left to guard the camp . 
 and now the girl , in her twentieth year , with centurions and soldiers around her , already removed from among the living by the forecast of doom , still could not reconcile herself to death
 such was the state of the war , when petilius cerialis reached mogontiacum
 he had never offered a sacrifice for the safety of the prince or for his heavenly voice
 even rome itself he put , so to say , under custody , garrisoning its walls with companies of soldiers and occupying with troops the coast and the river-banks
 finding his pleasure not so much in the rewards of peril as in peril itself , to assured and long acquired possession he preferred novelty , uncertainty , and risk
 crispus followed both were enraged , but their looks were different marcellus cast furious glances about him , while crispus smiled they were drawn back , however , into the senate by the hasty interference of friends
 germanicus having praised their zeal , took only for the war their arms and horses , and relieved the soldiers out of his own purse
 and so three years passed away , while ptolemy did not cease to urge his zealous solicitations
 tears and lamentations they soon dismiss
 many of the officers of state and a large proportion of the men of consular rank otho ordered to accompany him to the field , not indeed to share or serve in the campaign , but to form a retinue among them was lucius vitellius , whom otho treated as he treated the rest , and not as though he were the brother either of an emperor , or of an enemy
 nations , too , so high-spirited inclined the more slowly to peace , because julius classicanus , who had been sent as successor to catus and was at variance with suetonius , let private animosities interfere with the public interest , and had spread an idea that they ought to wait for a new governor who , having neither the anger of an enemy nor the pride of a conqueror , would deal mercifully with those who had surrendered
 valentinus still opposed , and succeeded in closing the ears of his countrymen to this advice , though he was not so diligent in preparing for war as he was assiduous in haranguing
 then the vitellianist troops , themselves also drawn up in three columns of defence , met the foe
 all else is common between us
 some , however , of the ubii and tungri were present but the treveri and lingones had the greatest weight in the matter
 albinus himself , who was sailing from the province tingitana to mauritania caesariensis , was murdered as he reached the shore
 the consuls went out , and having encouraged the young princes with kind words , brought them in and presented them to the emperor
 germanicus's trireme alone reached the country of the chauci
 they are however to be rather referred to the german race , for they have fixed habitations , carry shields , and delight in strength and fleetness of foot , thus presenting a complete contrast to the sarmatæ , who live in waggons and on horseback
 it is rhetoricians , as they are called , who are in request
 datum et lenitatis experimentum
 his father , julius antonius , was capitally punished for adultery with julia , and the son , when a mere youth , was banished by augustus , whose sister's grandson he was , to the city of massilia , where the name of exile might be masked under that of student
 about the same time he dedicated some temples of the gods , which had perished from age or from fire , and which augustus had begun to restore these were temples to liber , libera , and ceres , near the great circus , which last aulus postumius , when dictator , had vowed a temple to flora in the same place , which had been built by lucius and marcus publicius , aediles , and a temple to janus , which had been erected in the vegetable market by caius duilius , who was the first to make the roman power successful at sea and to win a naval triumph over the carthaginians
 sometimes he thought that he must overlook nothing , sometimes that he need not be afraid of everything , his mind fluctuating between shame and terror
 besides , frequent sallies were made from the town by the albici , and fire was thrown on our mound and turrets . 
 to-day this has come to pass , since an ex-consul has been murdered in his house by the treachery of slaves , which not one hindered or divulged , though the senate's decree , which threatens the entire slave-establishment with execution , has been till now unshaken
these being brought to him on the day which he had ordered , he appoints arbitrators between the states , who should estimate the damages and determine the reparation .
 and then with confused exclamations they spoke bitterly of the prices of exemptions , of their scanty pay , of the severity of their tasks , with special mention of the entrenchment , the fosse , the conveyance of fodder , building-timber , firewood , and whatever else had to be procured from necessity , or as a check on idleness in the camp
 for augustus had had thoughts of putting the roman state under germanicus , his sister's grandson , whom all men esteemed , but yielding to his wife's entreaties he left germanicus to be adopted by tiberius and adopted tiberius himself
when he had advanced some little way from the camp , he saw that his men were overpowered by the enemy and scarcely able to stand their ground , and that , the legion being crowded together , weapons were being cast on them from all sides .
 still at the consular elections he was present in company with the candidates like an ordinary citizen , and by shewing himself as a spectator in the theatre , as a partisan in the circus , he courted every breath of applause from the lowest rabble
 the agrippinenses were begging for help , and were offering to give up the wife and sister of civilis and the daughter of classicus , who had been left with them as pledges for the maintenance of the alliance
 under their auspices give battle , remembering your wives , your parents , and your father-land
marcus mettius , also , was found and brought back to him .
 there had suddenly sprung up a man , who gave out that he was scribonianus camerinus that , dreading the times of nero , he had concealed himself in histria , where the old family of the crassi still had dependants , estates , and a popular name
 so people began to ask , as if nero was already dethroned , who was to be elected
 vitellius thought it enough to have displayed the arms of rome , and he then bade tiridates remember his grandfather phraates , and his foster-father caesar , and all that was glorious in both of them , while the nobles were to show obedience to their king , and respect for us , each maintaining his honour and his loyalty
 even their generals did not act in concert civilis was traversing the pathless wilds of the belgae in attempting to capture claudius labeo , or to drive him out of the country
by this battle the war with the veneti and the whole of the sea coast was finished ; for both all the youth , and all , too , of more advanced age , in whom there was any discretion or rank , had assembled in that battle ; and they had collected in that one place whatever naval forces they had anywhere ; and when these were lost , the survivors had no place to retreat to , nor means of defending their towns .
 they were all harshly rebuked by lentulus , who peremptorily refused to propose calidius's motion . 
this position fortified one side of his camp by the banks of the river , rendered the country which lay in his rear secure from the enemy , and furthermore insured that provisions might without danger be brought to him by the remi and the rest of the states .
 it was rebuilt on the same site , when , after an interval of 415 years , it was burnt to the ground in the consulate of lucius scipio and caius norbanus
 there are your colours and your arms defeat is death , for disgrace you have exhausted
 excellent as he was in other respects , his policy to the conquered was arrogant , and exhibited the cruelty of one who was avenging private wrongs
 therefore , when caesar's men had an opportunity of a close engagement , they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of theirs and throwing in the grappling-irons , and holding both ships fast , they fought on both sides of the deck , and boarded the enemy's ; and having killed numbers of the albici and shepherds , they sank some of their ships , took others with the men on board , and drove the rest into the harbor . 
 i will frankly admit to you that i can hardly keep from laughing at some of the ancients , and from falling asleep at others
 his soldiers were obliged to cross extensive and difficult valleys . 
 there were three generals , and as many armies simon held the outer and larger circuit of walls
 then the price of infamy was raised , and pollio by secret corruption induced the soldiers to demand peace and to threaten that they would abandon the garrison
 when bidden to offer his neck resolutely , i wish , said he , that your stroke may be as resolute the tribune trembled greatly , and having only just severed his head at two blows , vaunted his brutality to nero , saying that he had slain him with a blow and a half
 agrippa was savage , and had been exasperated by insult , and neither from age nor experience in affairs was equal to so great a burden tiberius nero was of mature years , and had established his fame in war , but he had the old arrogance inbred in the claudian family , and many symptoms of a cruel temper , though they were repressed , now and then broke out
 neither of the generals loved delay but a wide extent of plain naturally saturated with water kept them apart
 those who made a stand were cut to pieces , the rest directing their flight to cremona
 he contemns religious rites
 a few of the gladiators resisted , and fell not altogether unavenged
and on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies from the town , and contended with our men in trifling skirmishes ; afterward , when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet , and fifteen miles in circuit , they kept themselves within the town .
 as soon as the work was finished , they sent embassadors to treat about a capitulation . 
 at his command they send the fleet to all parts ; they seize all the merchantmen they could meet with , and carry them into the harbor ; they apply the nails , timber , and rigging , with which they were furnished to rig and refit their other vessels . 
 nor does it follow that our speeches are less successful because they bring pleasure to the ears of those who have to decide
 the standards and colours were carried round the ramparts , and the prisoners also were displayed
 satis adprobatam vim datum et lenitatis experimentum
 the name of liberty was a lying pretext in the mouths of men who , base in private , dangerous in public life , had nothing to hope except from civil discord
 so the senate passed a resolution that their decrees should not be registered in the treasury till nine days had expired , and so much respite was to be given to condemned persons
 no doubt , there was peace after all this , but it was a peace stained with blood
 you too , in whose faces and in whose hearts i perceive a change , if only you restore to the senate their envoys , to the emperor his due allegiance , to myself my wife and son , do you stand aloof from pollution and separate the mutinous from among you
 he held private conferences with a few of his most intimate friends , and determined on the design of fleeing . 
 he had power , he had money , and he indulged the lusts that are the last solace of desperate fortunes
 whatever the fact was , tiberius as he was just entering illyria was summoned home by an urgent letter from his mother , and it has not been thoroughly ascertained whether at the city of nola he found augustus still breathing or quite lifeless
 the men were allowed license and vengeance to their heart's content soon afterwards germanicus entered the camp , and exclaiming with a flood of tears , that this was destruction rather than remedy , ordered the bodies to be burnt
all being greatly disconcerted by this alarm , the belief of the barbarians is strengthened that there is no garrison within , as they had heard from their prisoner .
 that same year , repeated demands on the part of the people , who denounced the excessive greed of the revenue collectors , made nero doubt whether he should not order the repeal of all indirect taxes , and so confer a most splendid boon on the human race
 still agrippina did not yet dare to attempt her greatest scheme , unless lusius geta and rufius crispinus were removed from the command of the praetorian cohorts for she thought that they cherished messalina's memory and were devoted to her children
 thus the terror raised by the generals , the cruelty of the punishments , the new obligation of an oath , removed all hopes of surrender for the present , changed the soldiers' minds , and reduced matters to the former state of war . 
 nero , never a disparager of himself , was wont to say that but one snake , at most , had been seen in his chamber
 thus otho ended his life in the 37th year of his age
 fabius valens was ordered to win over , if possible , or , if they refused his overtures , to ravage the provinces of gaul and to invade italy by way of the cottian alps caecina to take the nearer route , and to march down from the penine range
 and therefore this is my prayer to our allies , our citizens , and to heaven itself to the last , that , to my life's close , it grant me a tranquil mind , which can discern alike human and divine claims to the first , that , when i die , they honour my career and the reputation of my name with praise and kindly remembrance
 for as the worst emperors love an unlimited despotism , so the noblest like some check on liberty
that , besides , neither dare he go without an army into those parts of gaul which caesar had possession of , nor could he , without great expense and trouble , draw his army together to one place ; that to him , moreover , it appeared strange , what business either caesar or the roman people at all had in his own gaul , which he had conquered in war .
and it was impossible to persuade the latter to stay any longer , or to deter them from conveying succor to their own people .
 he required the senators to furnish a prescribed number of slaves and a certain weight of silver
 the swords of the britons are not pointed , and do not allow them to close with the foe , or to fight in the open field
to this was added , that they were indignant that their children were torn from them under the title of hostages , and they were persuaded that the romans designed to seize upon the summits of the alps , and unite those parts to the neighboring province , not only to secure the passes , but also a constant possession .
 as the girl rose to depart , she exclaimed , do you too forsake me
 even the average citizen , and not only the learned and critical hearer , perceives it , and forthwith showers his praises in the acknowledgment that the man has been a genuine student , has gone through every branch of eloquence , and is , in short , an orator
 see how i , the prefect of a single cohort , with the batavians and the canninefates , a mere fraction of gaul , have destroyed their vast but useless camps , or are pressing them with the close blockade of famine and the sword
 however , the good wife deserves the greater praise , just as the bad incurs a heavier censure
 but the keenest competition was between lollia paulina , the daughter of marcus lollius , an ex-consul , and julia agrippina , the daughter of germanicus
 the soldiers were so entirely devoted to him , that as he dictated the oath of allegiance and prayed for all prosperity to vitellius , they listened to him in silence
 in short , but for his avarice , he was equal to the generals of old mucianus , on the contrary , was eminent for his magnificence , for his wealth , and for a greatness that transcended in all respects the condition of a subject
 about the same time granius marcianus , a senator , who was accused of treason by caius gracchus , laid hands on himself tarius gratianus too , an ex-praetor , was condemned under the same law to capital punishment
 always very daring at first and excessively elated by success , they now in their eagerness for plunder bore up against reverse
on observing which , publius crassus , a young man , who commanded the cavalry—as he was more disengaged than those who were employed in the fight-sent the third line as a relief to our men who were in distress .
 on vitellius enquiring the cause of his emotion it is not , he replied , from any private apprehension , or because i am anxious for myself
 a double peril thus alarmed the britons , while the courage of the romans revived
 no honour was left for the gods , when augustus chose to be himself worshipped with temples and statues , like those of the deities , and with flamens and priests
 his father was of consular , his grandfather of praetorian rank
 among ignorant persons the very failure of the stream was regarded as a prodigy , as if the very rivers , the old defences of the empire , were deserting us
 for the britons , indeed , in no way cowed by the result of the late engagement , had made up their minds to be either avenged or enslaved , and convinced at length that a common danger must be averted by union , had , by embassies and treaties , summoned forth the whole strength of all their states
 such was the enthusiasm which followed the general's address , and so promptly did the veteran soldiery , with their long experience of battles , prepare for the hurling of the javelins , that it was with confidence in the result that suetonius gave the signal of battle
 neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them
 remember only their greed , their cruelty , their pride
 next he handed over the horses , beginning with his own , of the officers and tribunes , to the bravest fighters in the army , quite impartially , that these first , and then the infantry , might charge the enemy
 at the same time in rome , marcus caelius rufus , one of the praetors , having undertaken the cause of the debtors , on entering into his office , fixed his tribunal near the bench of caius trebonius , the city praetor , and promised if any person appealed to him in regard to the valuation and payment of debts made by arbitration , as appointed by caesar when in rome , that he would relieve them . 
therefore he selects workmen from the legions , and orders others to be sent for from the continent ; he writes to labienus to build as many ships as he could with those legions which were with him .
 having been listened to with great approval , he bound the whole assembly with barbarous rites and the national forms of oath
 stript of equality , all looked up to the commands of a sovereign without the least apprehension for the present , while augustus in the vigour of life , could maintain his own position , that of his house , and the general tranquillity
 these men made their way among the patrols , sentries and guards of the camp-gates , suggesting hope or holding out threats
 or have you taken up the book to revise it more carefully , and , after striking out whatever has given a handle for a bad interpretation , will you publish , if not a better , at least a safer , cato
 artabanus meanwhile , hearing of the treacherous arrangement , was one moment perplexed by apprehension , the next fired with a longing for revenge
 i say nothing about the learners' first rudiments
 of the slain on that day the greater number belonged to our army , but to its less effective part
 the inhabitants of metropolis , at first influenced by the same rumors , followed the same measures , shut the gates and manned their walls . 
 how small a part of a civil war is a single soldier ! with these words he raised the body , opened a grave , and discharged the last duties for his father
 it is certain that the treveri and lingones were injured in the eyes of the gallic nations by their having sided with verginius in the movement of vindex
 the army then proceeded by slow marches through the territory of the allobroges and vocontii , the very length of each day's march and the changes of encampment being made a matter of traffic by the general , who concluded disgraceful bargains to the injury of the holders of land and the magistrates of the different states , and used such menaces , that at lucus , a municipal town of the vocontii , he was on the point of setting fire to the place , when a present of money soothed his rage
 lately a woman had presided at the drill of the cohorts and the evolutions of the legions
 but now that we have in our households nations with different customs to our own , with a foreign worship or none at all , it is only by terror you can hold in such a motley rabble
 italy on both seas was guarded by fleets , at misenum and at ravenna , and the contiguous coast of gaul by ships of war captured in the victory of actium , and sent by augustus powerfully manned to the town of forojulium
 at capua , however , the third legion was stationed to pass the winter , and the noble families suffered severely
 aponius , however , agitated by the unexpected occurrence , had not written all the particulars , and flattering friends softened down its import
 there she endured a twenty years' exile , in which she was supported by relief from augusta , who having overthrown the prosperity of her step-children by secret machinations , made open display of her compassion to the fallen family
 some of the states were given to king cogidumnus , who lived down to our day a most faithful ally so was maintained the ancient and long-recognised practice of the roman people , which seeks to secure among the instruments of dominion even kings themselves
 at capua they first began to take courage and to rally , and determined to raise levies in the colonies , which had been sent thither by the julian law : and lentulus brought into the public market place the gladiators which caesar maintained there for the entertainment of the people , and confirmed them in their liberty , and gave them horses and ordered them to attend him ; but afterward , being warned by his friends that this action was censured by the judgment of all , he distributed them among the slaves of the district of campania , to keep guard there . 
 pompey , as soon as our men had forced the trenches , mounting his horse , and stripping off his general's habit , went hastily out of the back gate of the camp , and galloped with all speed to larissa . 
 born at vulsinii , the son of seius strabo , a roman knight , he attached himself in his early youth to caius caesar , grandson of the divine augustus , and the story went that he had sold his person to apicius , a rich debauchee soon afterwards he won the heart of tiberius so effectually by various artifices that the emperor , ever dark and mysterious towards others , was with sejanus alone careless and freespoken it was not through his craft , for it was by this very weapon that he was overthrown it was rather from heaven's wrath against rome , to whose welfare his elevation and his fall were alike disastrous
at the same time lucius fabius the centurion , and those who had scaled the wall with him , being surrounded and slain , were cast from the wall .
 and so they raised a din with brazen instruments and the combined notes of trumpets and horns , with joy or sorrow , as she brightened or grew dark
 which was he to prefer , without the fear that those whom he slighted would be infuriated by the affront
 but the deities are described in roman language as castor and pollux
 the divine julius once quelled an army's mutiny with a single word by calling those who were renouncing their military obedience 'citizens
 is it that , bound as they are by the chain of flattery , they are never thought servile enough by those who rule , or free enough by us
 others with osiris , the deity of the highest antiquity among these nations not a few with jupiter , as being supreme ruler of all things but most people with pluto , arguing from the emblems which may be seen on his statues , or from conjectures of their own
 sixteen praetorian and four city cohorts were being raised , each to consist of a thousand men
 nero , while he listened to this and like talk , was not indeed inspired with any guilty ambition , but still occasionally there would break from him wilful and thoughtless expressions which spies about his person caught up and reported with exaggeration , and this he had no opportunity of rebutting
 for the state in its public policy was strongly opposed to all such attempts
 meanwhile one of the enemy , acquainted with the roman tongue , spurred his horse up to the entrenchments , and in a loud voice promised in the name of arminius to all deserters wives and lands with daily pay of a hundred sesterces as long as war lasted
these , having too eagerly pursued the enemy's rear , come to a battle with the cavalry of the helvetii in a disadvantageous place , and a few of our men fall .
 and i maintain that the only orator is , and ever has been , one who , like a soldier equipped at all points going to the battle-field , enters the forum armed with every learned accomplishment
 afranius , perceiving that his rear was galled by our cavalry , and seeing the enemy before him , having come to a hill , made a halt on it . 
 the eagles of four legions were borne in front , and an equal number of colours from other legions on either side , then came the standards of twelve auxiliary squadrons , and the cavalry behind the ranks of the infantry
 in peace , he said , the merits of a man's case are carefully weighed when war bursts on us , innocent and guilty alike perish
 and when men shall hear of your adoption i shall no longer be thought old , and this is the only objection which is now made against me
 the renown of the name attracted the ignorant , and the greek mind eagerly fastens on what is new and marvellous
 even had they done so , they had not strength to repulse it
 but the successes and reverses of the old roman people have been recorded by famous historians
 for , in fact , augustus , a few years before , when he was a second time asking from the senate the tribunitian power for tiberius , though his speech was complimentary , had thrown out certain hints as to his manners , style , and habits of life , which he meant as reproaches , while he seemed to excuse
 i am not speaking of a quiet and peaceful accomplishment , which delights in what is virtuous and well regulated no the great and famous eloquence of old is the nursling of the licence which fools called freedom it is the companion of sedition , the stimulant of an unruly people , a stranger to obedience and subjection , a defiant , reckless , presumptuous thing which does not show itself in a well-governed state
 but those who criminated him fatally were rather believed , and on the motion of haterius agrippa , the consul-elect , the last penalty was invoked on the accused
 the battle had anything but the appearance of a cavalry action , for men and horses were carried along in confusion together , while chariots , destitute of guidance , and terrified horses without drivers , dashed as panic urged them , sideways , or in direct collision against the ranks
 the romans then began to prepare for an assault
 in the hearing of both armies afranius spoke thus : that caesar ought not to be displeased either with him or his soldiers , for wishing to preserve their attachment to their general , cneius pompey . 
in opposition to those things , titurius exclaimed , that they would do this too late , when greater forces of the enemy , after a junction with the germans , should have assembled ; or when some disaster had been received in the neighboring winter-quarters ; that the opportunity for deliberating was short ; that he believed that caesar had set forth into italy , as the carnutes would not otherwise have taken the measure of slaying tasgetius , nor would the eburones , if he had been present , have come to the camp with so great defiance of us ; that he did not regard the enemy , but the fact , as the authority ; that the rhine was near ; that the death of ariovistus and our previous victories were subjects of great indignation to the germans ; that gaul was inflamed , that after having received so many defeats she was reduced under the sway of the roman people , her pristine glory in military matters being extinguished .
 he disembarked the troops , which were to be marched to the country on the right , and thus several days were wasted in the construction of bridges
 penalties are distinguished ac-cording to the offence
 what force of every kind was to be with corbulo , he did not prescribe , provided they came in peaceful fashion , without breastplates and helmets
 the rest of caesar's fleet , after his flight , retired to adrumetum . 
 a further enrolment of veterans in tarentum and antium did but little for those thinly peopled places for most scattered themselves in the provinces where they had completed their military service
 some by their private embarrassments and so , good and bad , from different motives , but with equal zeal , were all eager for war
when he saw that he was put off too long , and that the day was close at hand on which he ought to serve out the corn to his soldiers ; —having called together their chiefs , of whom he had a great number in his camp , among them diviciacus and liscus who was invested with the chief magistracy , he severely reprimands them , because he is not assisted by them on so urgent an occasion , when the enemy were so close at hand , and when could neither be bought nor taken from the fields , particularly as , in a great measure urged by their prayers , he had undertaken the war ; much more bitterly , therefore does he complain of his being forsaken .
 it was a known fact that several knights , in struggling through the narrow approaches and the pressure of the crowd , were trampled to death , and that others while keeping their seats day and night were seized with some fatal malady
 while certainly it is arrogance to the state and an insult to the emperor to boast that he had the imperial power in his hands , and made a present of it to vespasian
 tiridates meanwhile , with the consent of the parthians , received the submission of nicephorium , anthemusias and the other cities , which having been founded by macedonians , claim greek names , also of the parthian towns halus and artemita there was a rivalry of joy among the inhabitants who detested artabanus , bred as he had been among the scythians , for his cruelty , and hoped to find in tiridates a kindly spirit from his roman training
 such indeed were the precautions of human wisdom
 when they faced the auxiliaries , they were felled by the swords and javelins of our legionaries if they wheeled round , they were again met by the sabres and spears of the auxiliaries
 as lepidus himself , out of modesty , declined to appoint , valerius naso , one of the ex-praetors , was chosen by lot and sent out
 but his mother's rage no lavish bounty could allay she would clasp octavia to her arms , and have many a secret interview with her friends with more than her natural rapacity , she clutched at money everywhere , seemingly for a reserve , and courteously received tribunes and centurions she honoured the names and virtues of the nobles who still were left , seeking apparently a party and a leader
 his spirits raised , titus rejoined his father , and was received as a mighty pledge of success by the wavering minds of the provincials and the troops
he leaves caius fabius , his lieutenant , with two legions to guard the camp .
 vitellius afterwards found more than 120 memorials from persons who claimed a reward for some notable service on that day all these persons he ordered to be sought out and slain , not to honour galba , but to comply with the traditional policy of rulers , who thus provide protection for the present and vengeance for the future
 but indeed of floggings and wounds , of hard winters , wearisome summers , of terrible war , or barren peace , there is no end
these benefits , says vercingetorix , you receive from me , whom you accuse of treason-me , by whose exertions you see so powerful and victorious an army almost destroyed by famine , without shedding one drop of your blood ; and i have taken precautions that no state shall admit within its territories this army in its ignominious flight from this place .
on that day little less than seven hundred of the soldiers were missing .
 helvidius priscus was a native of the town of carecina in italy , and was the son of one cluvius , who had been a centurion of the first rank in early youth he devoted his distinguished talents to the loftiest pursuits , not wishing , as do many , to cloak under an imposing name a life of indolence , but to be able to enter upon public life with a spirit fortified against the chances of fortune
 the pontificate was likewise conferred on nero , and on the day on which he first entered the forum , a gratuity was given to the city-populace , who greatly rejoiced at seeing a son of germanicus now grown to manhood
 these matters being settled , when the signal for marching was given , and the tents struck , it was observed that shortly before , contrary to his daily practice , pompey's army had advanced further than usual from his intrenchments , so that it appeared possible to come to an action on equal ground . 
 let not this monstrous news go forth to the whole world , that with you in their train civilis and classicus are about to invade italy
 there was also to be read what tributes were imposed on these nations , the weight of silver and gold , the tale of arms and horses , the gifts of ivory and of perfumes to the temples , with the amount of grain and supplies furnished by each people , a revenue as magnificent as is now exacted by the might of parthia or the power of rome
 and so after a brief pause the company resumed its mirth one and the same night witnessed britannicus's death and funeral , preparations having been already made for his obsequies , which were on a humble scale he was however buried in the campus martius , amid storms so violent , that in the popular belief they portended the wrath of heaven against a crime which many were even inclined to forgive when they remembered the immemorial feuds of brothers and the impossibility of a divided throne
 all around were slaughter and devastation
 the rest made a rush for the ships , where everything was involved in a general panic , the troops being mingled with country people , whom the vitellianists slaughtered indiscriminately
 but i return to my work
 it was determined that the capitol should be restored
 but when it became notorious that otho and vitellius , opposed in impious strife , were ready to make a spoil of the empire , the thought that others would engross the rewards of power , while they would have nothing left for themselves but a compulsory submission , made the soldiers murmur and take a survey of their own strength
 so the mutiny began to abate , and at the close of the day the men dispersed to their tents the same night flavianus set out , and being met by letters from vespasian , was relieved from his perilous position
 cato was in sicily , repairing the old ships of war , and demanding new ones from the states , and these things he performed with great zeal . 
 the soldiers given into his hands
 some expenses , though very serious , were generally kept secret by a concealment of the real prices
 the auxiliary infantry and cavalry , with some picked troops from the legions , appeared sufficient for a war that was all but finished
 i must not pass over a prognostication of tiberius respecting servius galba , then consul
 his will , full of loathsome flatteries of nero , was a concession to his love of his wife , a base woman , with only a beautiful person to recommend her , whom he had taken away from her husband , one of his friends
the soldiers called these cippi .
 there were some orators at rhodes and a host of them at athens , but there the people , there any ignorant fellow , anybody , in short , could do anything
 when the report of the capture of the legions became generally known , all who but a short time before trembled at the name of rome rushed forth from the fields and houses , and spread themselves everywhere to enjoy with extravagant delight the strange spectacle
 i have often heard him say that a single legion with a few auxiliaries could conquer and occupy ireland , and that it would have a salutary effect on britain for the roman arms to be seen everywhere , and for freedom , so to speak , to be banished from its sight
these the cavalry pursued over the very open plains , and after leaving scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50 , 000 , which it was certain had assembled out of aquitania and from the cantabri , returned late at night to the camp .
 egypt and the eastern provinces were also governed in his name
besides that , the towns ought to be burned which were not secured against every danger by their fortifications or natural advantages ; that there should not be places of retreat for their own countrymen for declining military service , nor be exposed to the romans as inducements to carry off abundance of provisions and plunder .
 drusus stood there , and with a gesture of his hand demanded silence
 many , who had struggled on to the walls , they stabbed with their short swords
in the middle of this voyage , is an island , which is called mona : many smaller islands besides are supposed to lie , of which islands some have written that at the time of the winter solstice it is night there for thirty consecutive days .
 cneius magius , from cremona , engineer-general to pompey , was taken prisoner on the road and brought to caesar , but sent back by him to pompey with this message : as hitherto he had not been allowed an interview , and was now on his march to him at brundusium , that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and general safety that he should have an interview with pompey ; and that the same advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the proposals were conveyed to them by others , as if terms were argued by them both in person . 
 while they were seeking a suitable time and place , and for that which in such an affair is the great difficulty , the first man to speak , while hope , fear , the chances of success or of disaster , were present to their minds , one day , on vespasian quitting his chamber , a few soldiers who stood near , in the usual form in which they would salute their legate , suddenly saluted him as emperor
 they were instantly slain , and their names have consequently been lost
he directs labienus and trebonius to return by the same day , if they can do so agreeably to the interests of the republic ; so that their measures having been mutually imparted , and the plans of the enemy having been discovered , they might be able to commence a different line of operations .
 they fought in a narrow defile without any decided result , till the germans swam across and attacked labeo's rear
 while legate of a legion , he first supported , then slandered , verginius
 augustus had shown indulgence to the entertainment by way of humouring maecenas's extravagant passion for bathyllus , nor did he himself dislike such amusements , and he thought it citizenlike to mingle in the pleasures of the populace
 never were the people more keenly interested never did they indulge themselves more freely in secret whispers against the emperor or in the silence of suspicion
 the office of praetor was taken away from tettius julianus , as having deserted his legion when it passed over to the party of vespasian , with a view to its being transferred to plotius griphus
 everything , however , was faithfully reported to asprenas , and at his bidding the ship was boarded and taken , and the man , whoever he was , killed
these having advanced a little way , when already the rear was in sight , some horse came to caesar from quintus atrius , to report that the preceding night , a very great storm having arisen , almost all the ships were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore , because neither the anchors and cables could resist , nor could the sailors and pilots sustain the violence of the storm ; and thus great damage was received by that collision of the ships .
 he then summoned those at whose suggestion a king had been sought from rome , and having encamped at zeugma where the river was most easily fordable and awaited the arrival of the chief men of parthia and of acbarus , king of the arabs , he reminded meherdates that the impulsive enthusiasm of barbarians soon flags from delay or even changes into treachery , and that therefore he should urge on his enterprise
although he now saw distinctly the treachery of the aedui in many things , and was of opinion that the revolt of the entire state would be hastened by their departure ; yet he thought that they should not be detained , lest he should appear either to offer an insult , or betray some suspicion of fear .
 this caused indignation , and the ringleaders of the concerted rebellion prevailed upon the people to refuse the conscription
caesar thought that these things tended to the self-same point ; that , in consequence of a delay of three days intervening , their horse , which were at a distance , might return ; however , he said , that he would not that day advance further than four miles for the purpose of procuring water ; he ordered that they should assemble at that place in as large a number as possible , the following day , that he might inquire into their demands .
 having assembled the senate , he reminded them of the injustice of his enemies ; and told them , that he aimed at no extraordinary honor , but had waited for the time appointed by law , for standing candidate for the consulate , being contented with what was allowed to every citizen . 
 and the owners , as with their wives and children they came forth to meet the army , found themselves surrounded , in the midst of the security of peace , with all the horrors of war
 messalina with flowing hair shook the thyrsus , and silius at her side , crowned with ivy and wearing the buskin , moved his head to some lascivious chorus
 it was when the whole legion from the fleet had taken the oath to him , that feeling confidence in his strength , and thinking that the men , on whose individual feeling he had been working , should be roused by a general appeal , he stood before the rampart of the camp , and spoke as follows 
 but marcellus said that he would not allow this motion for the present . 
 they had , however , destroyed the barrow lately raised in memory of varus's legions , and the old altar of drusus
 and vespasian , they said , is not so arrogant as to tolerate such a subject as vitellius
 meanwhile , a stepmother's treacherous schemes were convulsing the whole imperial house , with far greater disgrace than would have resulted from his concealment of the profligacy of the emperor's former wife
 meanwhile the 21st legion , by way of vindonissa , and sextilius felix with the auxiliary infantry , by way of rhaetia , penetrated into the province
 the conflict was terminated by the flight of the vanquished , who carried off what boats were left
 the answer was that he had no right to invoke the aid of roman arms against the cherusci , when he had rendered no assistance to the romans in their conflict with the same enemy
 he could speak greek with considerable grace , and in all that he did and said he had the art of displaying himself to advantage nothing excited the provincials and the army so much as the assertion of mucianus that vitellius had determined to remove the legions of germany to syria , to an easy and lucrative service , while the armies of syria were to have given them in exchange the encampments of germany with their inclement climate and their harassing toils
 it began in sport , but the number of those who fell aggravated the horrors of the war
 was sacrovir too , they asked , to be charged with treason before the senate
 in their alarm they doubted whether this was a casual outbreak of the soldiers , or an act of treachery in the emperor , and whether to remain and be arrested was a more perilous alternative than to disperse and fly at one time making a show of courage , at another betrayed by their terror , they still watched the countenance of otho
 vibius crispus , whose wealth , power , and ability , made him rank among men of distinction , rather than among men of worth , demanded that annius faustus , of the equestrian order , who in the days of nero had practised the trade of the informer , should be brought to trial before the senate
 as to the rest , they were wholly in the dark , seeing that he lived to extreme old age in the country or on the coast near rome and often close to the very walls of the city
 so we entered the study of maternus , and found him seated with the very book which he had read the day before , in his hands secundus began has the talk of ill-natured people no effect in deterring you , maternus , from clinging to your cato with its provocations
at length the germans , on the right wing , having gained the top of the hill , dislodge the enemy from their position and pursue them even as far as the river at which vercingetorix with the infantry was stationed , and slay several of them .
 pregnant as she was , she endured , somehow or other , out of fear of the enemy and love of her husband , the first part of the flight , but after a while , when she felt herself shaken by its continuous speed , she implored to be rescued by an honourable death from the shame of captivity
 hortalus said nothing , either from alarm or because even in his reduced fortunes he clung to his hereditary nobility
being prevailed upon by their entreaties he moves his camp from the country of the bituriges in the direction of the arverni .
 through these defences the roman general , though he had with him only the allied troops , without the strength of the legions , attempted to break , and having assigned their positions to his cohorts , he equipped even his cavalry for the work of infantry
 but reverses and successes seemed equally to kindle in the troops the one desire of murdering their officers
 and had it not quickly been known that no corpse was found , that the slaves , when tortures were applied , denied the murder , and that the man never had a brother , they would have been on the point of destroying the general
 fortune seemed to smile on his efforts through his fleets , which commanded the sea , he held the greater part of italy , even as far as where the chain of the maritime alps begins the task of attempting the passage of this chain , and of advancing into the provincia narbonensis , he had entrusted to three generals , suedius clemens , antonius novellus , and aemilius pacensis
 those floods continued several days . 
 it is found by experience , senators , that admirable laws and right precedents among the good have their origin in the misdeeds of others
 it happened that king ptolemy , a minor , was there with a considerable army , engaged in war with his sister cleopatra , whom a few months before , by the assistance of his relations and friends , he had expelled from the kingdom ; and her camp lay at a small distance from his . 
 this procured him pity , which was the more conspicuous , as night with its merriment had stript off all disguise
 they carry a spear framea is their name for it , with a narrow and short head , but so sharp and easy to wield that the same weapon serves , according to circumstances , for close or distant conflict
 of these , lucanus , quintianus , and senecio long persisted in denial after a time , when bribed by the promise of impunity , anxious to excuse their reluctance , lucanus named his mother atilla , quintianus and senecio , their chief friends , respectively , glitius gallus and annius pollio
 strangers have reigned over us
 at the same moment the infantry charged , and the cavalry which had been sent on in advance dashed on the rear and the flanks
 the infuriated soldiers , remembering their hardships and how often the longed-for conflict had been eluded , sated themselves to a man with vengeance and bloodshed
that as much as he admired the greatness of their courage , since neither the fortifications of the camp , nor the height of the mountain , nor the wall of the town could retard them ; in the same degree he censured their licentiousness and arrogance , because they thought that they knew more than their general concerning victory , and the issue of actions : and that he required in his soldiers forbearance and self-command , not less than valor and magnanimity .
 when the padus was in sight and night began to fall they judged it expedient to entrench a camp
on the other side he sends the gabali and the nearest cantons of the arverni against the helvii ; he likewise sends the ruteni and cadurci to lay waste the territories of the volcae arecomici .
 to be chosen successor to vitellius would be more of an insult than a compliment it is not against the vigorous intellect of the divine augustus , it is not against the profound subtlety of the aged tiberius , it is not even against the house of caius , claudius , or nero , established by a long possession of the empire , that we are rising in revolt
 others were seeking them
 now that the family of the julii and the claudii has come to an end , adoption will discover the worthiest successor
 he seemed to see quintilius varus , covered with blood , rising out of the swamps , and to hear him , as it were , calling to him , but he did not , as he imagined , obey the call he even repelled his hand , as he stretched it over him at daybreak the legions , posted on the wings , from panic or perversity , deserted their position and hastily occupied a plain beyond the morass
 many too believed that some of the soldiers of vitellius had come to the capital to learn the feelings of the different parties
 but the reverse was the result , so much so that his kingdom was plundered by centurions , his house by slaves , as if they were the spoils of war
 accordingly , leaving two auxiliary cohorts in the garrison at ilerda , they crossed the segre with their whole force , and formed one camp with the two legions which they had led across a few days before . 
 the temple where the soldiers had assembled , was stormed after a two days' siege
 up to this time everything had been quiet in germany , from the temper of the generals , who , now that triumphal decorations had been vulgarised , hoped for greater glory by the maintenance of peace
the army of the romans is distributed along their extensive lines , and with difficulty meets the enemy in every quarter .
 the massilians , however , began to make the necessary preparations for the defense of their city with unwearied energy . 
 afranius's five legions were drawn up in two lines , the auxiliary cohorts formed the third line , and acted as reserves caesar had three lines , four cohorts out of each of the five legions formed the first line . 
 this was passed over as too atrocious to be true
 to what did all these things tend , unless to his ruin ? but , nevertheless , he was ready to condescend to any terms , and to endure every thing for the sake of the republic . 
 the nonmilitary population were sold by auction
the helvetii , disappointed in this hope , tried , if they could , to force a passage , but being kept at bay by the strength of our works , and by the concourse of the soldiers , and by the missiles , they desisted from this attempt .
 he carved , painted , sang , or practised the management of horses , occasionally composing verses which showed that he had the rudiments of learning
 with him was associated licinius proculus , otho's intimate friend , and consequently suspected of having encouraged his schemes
the latter quickly took up arms and drove them back again to their forests ; and having killed a great many , lost a few of their own men while pursuing them too far through those intricate places .
 this , indeed , has a finish about the phrases and the periods , and suits the ear of the critic , whence you may infer that even calvus understood what a better style is , but that he lacked genius and power rather than the will to speak with more dignity and grace
 think not , pompey , says he , that this is the army which conquered gaul and germany ; i was present at all those battles , and do not speak at random on a subject to which i am a stranger : a very small part of that army now remains , great numbers lost their lives , as must necessarily happen in so many battles , many fell victims to the autumnal pestilence in italy , many returned home , and many were left behind on the continent . 
 next come the reudigni , the aviones , the anglii , the varini , the eudoses , the suardones , and nuithones who are fenced in by rivers or forests
 as for thrace , since the division of the kingdom between rhoemetalces and the children of cotys , who because of their tender age were under the guardianship of trebellienus rufus , it was divided against itself , from not being used to our rule , and blamed rhoemetalces no less than trebellienus for allowing the wrongs of his countrymen to go unpunished
 it was thought best to go to the camp this would be a compliment to the soldiery , and their favour , base as it was to purchase it by bribery or intrigue , was not to be despised if it could be obtained by honourable means
 the legions of moesia are coming
 following ancient precedent , he heard his wife's cause in the presence of kinsfolk , involving , as it did , her legal status and character , and he reported that she was innocent
 this made him hasten his advance to alexandria , for , now that the army of vitellius was shattered , he sought to apply the pressure of famine to the capital , which is always dependent on foreign supplies
 on the next day of the senate's meeting much was said against the luxury of the country by quintus haterius , an ex-consul , and by octavius fronto , an ex-praetor
 at the same time it was thought that in wresting from vitellius a colony so rich in resources there would be both profit and glory
but those who were left as a guard opposite the camp of labienus , when they heard that the battle was commenced , marched to aid their countrymen and take possession of a hill , but were unable to withstand the attack of the victorious soldiers .
 for my own part , i agree with those who think that the tribes of germany are free from all taint of intermarriages with foreign nations , and that they appear as a distinct , unmixed race , like none but themselves
 trebellienus perished by his own hand paconianus was strangled in prison for having there written some lampoons on the emperor
 and he protested that he , though caesar's legate , was kept out of the province which caesar had given him , not by the legions for he had come at their invitation but by sentius , who was veiling private animosity under lying charges
 here it might be seen what security men derive from a resolute spirit for the recruits , frightened at the number of vessels , and fatigued with the rolling of the sea , and with sea-sickness , surrendered to otacilius , after having first received his oath , that the enemy would not injure them ; but as soon as they were brought before him , contrary to the obligation of his oath , they were inhumanly put to death in his presence . 
 even great generals grow insolent in prosperity
 the rest crowded round the general's tribunal in a dense mass
 i am said to have praised brutus and cassius , whose careers many have described and no one mentioned without eulogy
 the young were divided between tarsa and turesis , both of whom had resolved to fall together with their freedom
 a fleet being thus furnished with every necessary , he advanced with great confidence against our ships , commanded by decimus brutus . 
 at first they carried their point , and the trial was postponed for a few days , but before long faustus was condemned , but by no means with that unanimity on the part of the people which his detestable character had deserved
 the more secret , known only to the advocate himself , are yet greater
 we are not afraid of vespasian
 he was slain by publius ventidius , and the parthians were driven back over the euphrates
 an earthquake too demolished a large part of pompeii , a populous town in campania
 many perished in the crush and by their own weapons the victorious army , who avoided the colonia agrippinensis , did not venture on any other hostile act during the remainder of their march , and excused the conflict at bonna , alleging that they had asked for peace , and that when it was refused they had but looked to their own safety
 why should he not speak for or against peace and war , or on the taxes and laws and other matters involving roman interests
 beneath these many of the assailants were buried , and many , as the slaughter increased with the confusion , and the attack from the walls became fiercer , retreated wounded , fainting , and mangled , with serious damage to the prestige of the party
 in the mean time the oscenses and the calagurritani , who were under the government of the oscenses , send embassadors to caesar , and offer to submit to his orders . 
 near the proconsul's chamber they chanced to meet a slave , and asked him who he was , and where piso was to be found
 domitian , seeing that his youth was despised by the older officers , gave up even the less important functions of government which he had before exercised under a semblance of simple and modest tastes , he wrapped himself in a profound reserve , and affected a devotion to literature and a love of poetry , thus seeking to throw a veil over his character , and to withdraw himself from the jealousy of his brother , of whose milder temper , so unlike his own , he judged most falsely
 the oppian laws were formerly adopted to meet the political necessities of the time , and subsequently there was some remission and mitigation of them on grounds of expediency
all the forces of the enemy being thus routed , and stripped of their arms , betake themselves to their camp and fortifications .
 everything , lawful or unlawful , they were ready to seize or to sell , sparing nothing , sacred or profane
but not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed .
 not only , they said , were there the usual harvests , and the gold of the mine with its alloy , but the earth now teemed with a new abundance , and wealth was thrust on them by the bounty of the gods these and other servile flatteries they invented , with consummate eloquence and equal sycophancy , confidently counting on the facility of his belief
 he bore indeed the same or even more burdens than the common soldier subsequently , they reached lands under cultivation , and reaped the crops , and of two fortresses in which the armenians had fled for refuge , one was taken by storm
 piso expired by having the veins in his arms severed
 the legion under the command of caesius nasica fought with a similar result
 his mother was a daughter of catumerus , chief of the chatti
wondering what was the reason of this conduct , he inquired of themselves .
 in the fifth consulship of tiberius claudius with sextius cornelius orfitus for his colleague , nero was prematurely invested with the dress of manhood , that he might be thought qualified for political life
 sometimes , as in a cavalry-action , there would be alternate advances and retreats , then , again , close fighting , in which , breast to breast , with the clash of arms , they repulsed the foe or were themselves repulsed
 and now was seen the assembling of troops and the gleam of arms , as the boldest warriors stepped to the fro , as the line was forming , agricola , who , though his troop were in high spirits and could scarcely be kept within the entrenchments , still thought it right to encourage them , spoke as follows 
 he told them that in destroying for ever their treacherous , cowardly , and beaten foe , they had to execute a punishment , rather than to fight a battle
it is proclaimed that they will march at day-break ; the remainder of the night is spent without sleep , since every soldier was inspecting his property , what he could carry with him , and what , out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters , he would be compelled to leave ; every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay without danger , and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the soldiers and their want of sleep .
 her name was atria galla
 the effect of this disaster on the vitellianists was not so much to drive them to fear as to draw them to obedience
 new adherents soon declared themselves in valerius asiaticus , legate of the province of belgica , whom vitellius soon after made his son-in-law , and junius blaesus , governor of gallia lugdunensis , who brought with him the italian legion and the taurine horse , which was stationed at lugdunum
 octavius attended by one freedman entered with a dagger concealed under his dress
 a distinction had been made in the assessments of senators and knights , not because they differed naturally , but that the superiority of the one class in places in the theatre , in rank and in honour , might be also maintained in everything else which insured mental repose and bodily recreation , unless indeed men in the highest position were to undergo more anxieties and more dangers , and to be at the same time deprived of all solace under those anxieties and dangers
 the chiefs have a more elaborate style
 meantime the parthians , he thought , indulgent as they are to an absent prince , though restless under his presence , might turn to a better mind
p sextius baculus , who had led a principal century under caesar , had been left an invalid in the garrison , and had now been five days without food .
 receiving an answer that the way was open and the sea propitious , he then , after sacrificing a number of victims , asked some questions in ambiguous phrase concerning himself
they accordingly surrendered themselves and all their possessions to caesar , on whom caesar thought that punishment should be inflicted the more severely , in order that for the future the rights of embassadors might be more carefully respected by barbarians ; having , therefore , put to death all their senate , he sold the rest for slaves .
they order every one to carry forth from home for himself provisions for three months , ready ground they persuade the rauraci , and the tulingi , and the latobrigi , their neighbors , to adopt the same plan , and after burning down their towns and villages , to set out with them : and they admit to their party and unite to themselves as confederates the boii , who had dwelt on the other side of the rhine , and had crossed over into the norican territory , and assaulted noreia .
cicero , who during all the foregoing days had kept his soldiers in camp with the greatest exactness , and agreeable to the injunctions of caesar , had not permitted even any of the camp-followers to go beyond the fortification , distrusting on the seventh day that caesar would keep his promise as to the number of days , because he heard that he had proceeded further , and no report as to his return was brought to him , and being urged at the same time by the expressions of those who called his tolerance almost a siege , if , forsooth , it was not permitted them to go out of the camp , since he might expect no disaster , whereby he could be injured , within three miles of the camp , while nine legions and all the cavalry were under arms , and the enemy scattered and almost annihilated , sent five cohorts into the neighboring corn-lands , between which and the camp only one hill intervened , for the purpose of foraging .
 the common soldiers were undoubtedly loyal to vitellius , but all the most distinguished men were in favour of vespasian
 anxious to distinguish himself by noble pursuits , and the reputation of an orator , he advocated the cause of the people of ilium , and having eloquently recounted how rome was the offspring of troy , and aeneas the founder of the julian line , with other old traditions akin to myths , he gained for his clients exemption from all public burdens
 when they did this without refusal , and with outstretched arms , prostrating themselves on the ground , with tears , implored his mercy : he comforted them and bade them rise , and having spoken a few words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears , he pardoned them all , and gave orders to his soldiers , that no injury should be done to them , and nothing taken from them . 
 the ocean and remote rivers were the boundaries of the empire
 whenever they saw a man tall and young they cut him down , making no distinction between soldiers and civilians
 never , when i have addressed you , have i felt more anxious for your welfare , never more indifferent about my own
 they instantly rushed forward and charged pompey's horse with such fury , that not a man of them stood ; but all wheeling about , not only quitted their post , but galloped forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountains . 
 this flattery is not paid to their kings , nor this honour to our emperors
for these reasons he appointed titus labienus , his legate , to the command of the fortification which he had made he himself proceeds to italy by forced marches , and there levies two legions , and leads out from winter-quarters three which were wintering around aquileia , and with these five legions marches rapidly by the nearest route across the alps into further gaul .
 neither commander nor tribune was present to control them
 some , however , thought that its old arrangement had been more conducive to health , inasmuch as the narrow streets with the elevation of the roofs were not equally penetrated by the sun's heat , while now the open space , unsheltered by any shade , was scorched by a fiercer glow
 quitting the sea-coast on the pretence of a hunting expedition , he struck into trackless forests , and was soon borne by his swift steed to the river pyramus , the bridges over which had been broken down by the natives as soon as they heard of the king's escape
 soon they felt shame at parthians having become degenerate , at their having sought a king from another world , one too infected with the training of the enemy , at the throne of the arsacids now being possessed and given away among the provinces of rome
 driven out soon afterwards by the overwhelming strength of the hermundusi led by vibilius , he was received and sent to forum julii , a colony of narbonensian gaul
 dread of germanicus had made that prince faithful to the romans and just to his people , but he subsequently changed this behaviour for insolence towards us and tyranny to his subjects he was elated by the wars which he had successfully waged against the surrounding nations , while he disdained the aged and , as he thought , unwarlike tiberius , eagerly coveting armenia , over which , on the death of artaxias , he placed arsaces , his eldest son he further added insult , and sent envoys to reclaim the treasures left by vonones in syria and cilicia
 as for ollius , before he attained promotion , the friendship of sejanus was his ruin
orgetorix is chosen to complete these arrangements .
 then he turned to the envoys and bestowed high praise on the young foster-son of rome , as one whose self-control had hitherto been exemplary
he shares the bribe with them , and exhorts them to remember that they were free and born for empire ; that the state of the aedui was the only one which retarded the most certain victory of the gauls ; that the rest were held in check by its authority ; and , if it was brought over , the romans would not have room to stand on in gaul ; that he had received some kindness from caesar , only so far , however , as gaining a most just cause by his decision ; but that he assigned more weight to the general freedom ; for , why should the aedui go to caesar to decide concerning their rights and laws , rather than the romans come to the aedui ? the young men being easily won over by the speech of the magistrate and the bribe , when they declared that they would even be leaders in the plot , a plan for accomplishing it was considered , because they were confident their state could not be induced to undertake the war on slight grounds .
 unused to insult , the spirit of the soldiers resented the jest
 it would have been a rare combination of princely qualities , if , with their respective faults removed , their virtues only could have been united in one man mucianus was governor of syria , vespasian of judaea in the administration of these neighbouring provinces jealousy had produced discord between them , but on nero's fall they had dropped their animosities and associated their counsels at first they communicated through friends , till titus , who was the great bond of union between them , by representing their common interests had terminated their mischievous feud
 but if , says he , we were convinced of the truth of the reports of the disaffection of the army which i indeed am confident are either altogether groundless , or at least less than they are supposed to be , how much better to conceal and hide our suspicions of it , than by our conduct confirm it ? ought not the defects of an army to be as carefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies , lest we should increase the enemy's hopes ? but they moreover advise us to set out at midnight , in order , i suppose , that those who attempt to do wrong may have a fairer opportunity ; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by shame or fear , to the display of which the night is most averse . 
 they must , it seemed , be subject to a female and to two striplings besides , who for a while would burden , and some day rend asunder the state
 they resolve when error is impossible
 with a dry season and comparatively shallow streams , a rare circumstance in that climate , he had accomplished , without obstruction , rapid march , and he feared for his return heavy rains and swollen rivers
 his head , which the sutlers and camp-followers had fixed on a pole and mangled , was found only the next day in front of the tomb of patrobius , a freedman of nero's , whom galba had executed
 several men bore the title at the same time , without pre-eminence above their fellows
 both executions , however , were unfavourably regarded indeed , when a ruler once becomes unpopular , all his acts , be they good or bad , tell against him
therefore encouraging each other , under the conduct of caius trebonius , a roman knight , who had been appointed over them , they break through the midst of the enemy , and arrive in the camp safe to a man .
 following these examples , lepidus , though possessed of a moderate fortune , now revived the glory of his ancestors
 needy , obscure , and restless , he wormed himself by stealthy informations into the confidence of a vindictive prince , and soon imperilled all the most distinguished citizens and having thus gained influence with one , hatred from all besides , he left an example in following which beggars became wealthy , the insignificant , formidable , and brought ruin first on others , finally on themselves
these the germans take with much pains in pits and kill them .
 not by treachery , not against pregnant women , but openly against armed men do i wage war
 the praetorian cohorts carried his body with praises and tears , covering his wound and his hands with kisses
 yielding at length to the importunity of the army , which had taken up its position at mevania , and accompanied by a numerous train of senators , into which many were brought by ambition and more by fear , he entered the camp , undecided in purpose and at the mercy of faithless counsels
 a plausible profession this in words , but really unmeaning and delusive , and the greater the disguise of freedom which marked it , the more cruel the enslavement into which it was soon to plunge us
 it was in the capital and the forum that we first essayed civil wars then rose c marius , sprung from the very dregs of the populace , and l
 as to the king's visit and the respect shown to himself , it was graceful and modest
 it shows the same spirit not to believe in poppaea's divinity as to refuse to swear obedience to the acts of the divine augustus and the divine julius
 the two divisions of mauritania , rhaetia , noricum and thrace and the other provinces governed by procurators , as they were near this or that army , were driven by the presence of such powerful neighbours into friendship or hostility
 there is no doubt that the province and the troops entertained feelings of hostility to vespasian , and some of the vitellianists , who had escaped from the capital , incessantly represented to piso that gaul was hesitating and germany ready to revolt , that his own position was perilous , and that for one who in peace must be suspected , war was the safer course
 the more insincere their demonstrations , the more they multiplied them
 the veteran soldiers hesitated
they with difficulty sustain the attack till night ; despairing of safety , they all to a man destroy themselves in the night .
 then too he insisted on the ancient boundaries of persia and macedonia , and intimated , with a vainglorious threat , that he meant to seize on the country possessed by cyrus and afterwards by alexander
 this speech of scipio's , as the senate was convened in the city , and pompey was near at hand , seemed to have fallen from the lips of pompey himself . 
 nay , more the childless , the rich , and the powerful often go to one who is both young and poor , in order to intrust him with difficulties affecting themselves or their friends
 trebellius , who had escaped the soldiers' fury by flying and hiding himself , governed henceforth on sufferance , a disgraced and humbled man
 that night is my witness would that it had been my last
 putting in motion a force of marines , he broke up the seditious combination in its very first beginnings
the other order is that of the knights .
 all the relations between us were those of hatred and hostility , first made so by him , and afterwards embittered by me
 on the left the bructeri and the tencteri one division marching over the hills , another passing between the highroad and the river mosella , made the attack with such suddenness , that cerialis , who had not slept in the camp , was in his chamber and even in his bed , when he heard at the same moment that the battle had begun , and that his men were being worsted
 but if they were doomed to slavery as a conquered people , they had swords and young warriors and a spirit bent on freedom or resigned to death
 in their turn they rushed to the attack , and there was a furious conflict within the narrow passages of the gates till the enemy were routed both armies did their utmost , the one for the honour of having given aid , the other for that of not having needed support
 thus it happened that two soldiers , one of whom belonged to the 5th legion , while the other was one of the gallic auxiliaries , challenged each other in sport to a wrestling match the legionary was thrown , and the gaul taunted him the soldiers who had assembled to witness the contest took different sides , till the legionaries made a sudden and murderous attack on the auxiliary troops , and destroyed two cohorts
 still the senate had not liberty to alter their purpose , and lapse of time never softened tiberius
 am i to call you soldiers , you who have beset with entrenchments and arms your general's son , or citizens , when you have trampled under foot the authority of the senate
 when this affair was made , afranius drew out his forces , and posted them on the middle of a hill , near his camp . 
they do not live much on corn , but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh , and are much in hunting ; which circumstance must , by the nature of their food , and by their daily exercise and the freedom of their life , both promote their strength and render them men of vast stature of body .
and i do not know whether that ought much to be wondered at , as well for several other reasons , as particularly because they who ranked above all nations for prowess in war , most keenly regretted that they had lost so much of that reputation as to submit to commands from the roman people .
what , therefore , is my design ? to do as our ancestors did in the war against the cimbri and teutones , which was by no means equally momentous who , when driven into their towns , and oppressed by similar privations , supported life by the corpses of those who appeared useless for war on account of their age , and did not surrender to the enemy : and even if we had not a precedent for such cruel conduct , still i should consider it most glorious that one should be established , and delivered to posterity .
 as soon as the accuser appeared , all but vitellia were frightened into giving evidence she alone swore that she had heard not a word
 if you ask me , i think they all said what was true
but those who had come forth from alesia returned into the town dejected and almost despairing of success .
caesar concludes the council and imposes a levy of cavalry on the states .
 at length vitellius , appalled by the irruption of the enemy and by the menacing intelligence from every quarter , ordered caecina and valens to take the field
the sigambri , who are nearest to the rhine , by whom , we have mentioned above , the tenchtheri and usipetes were received after their retreat , collect 2 , 000 horse ; they cross the rhine in ships and barks thirty miles below that place where the bridge was entire and the garrison left by caesar ; they arrive at the frontiers of the eburones , surprise many who were scattered in flight , and get possession of a large amount of cattle , of which barbarians are extremely covetous .
 after his death , messengers passed to and fro between civilis and classicus , commander of the cavalry of the treveri
 these mutinous proceedings , so ruinous to discipline , antonius soon turned to his own profit , regardless of the near approach of mucianus , a neglect more fatal than any contempt for vespasian
 finally , he hemmed in a roman cohort near the river pagyda
 the celestial spirit has not transferred itself to the mute statue
 there were missing that day about two hundred bow-men , a few horse , and an inconsiderable number of servants and baggage . 
 his property was divided among his accusers , and praetorships out of the usual order were conferred on those who were of senators' rank
 for suevia is divided and cut in half by a continuous mountain-range , beyond which live a multitude of tribes
and to wait until the enemy's forces were augmented and their cavalry had returned , he concluded , would be the greatest madness ; and knowing the fickleness of the gauls , he felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired among them by this one skirmish .
 at last he entrusted the affair to sallustius crispus , who chose two of his dependants some say they were soldiers and urged them to go to him as pretended accomplices , offering money and promising faithful companionship in danger
 accordingly he begged a few days' respite , and at last abandoned his defence , after venturing on a memorial to the emperor , in which he mingled reproach and entreaty
 with respect to the two legates , herennius and numisius , it was thought enough to put them in chains
 corbulo then encamped on the spot , and considered whether he should push on his legions without their baggage to artaxata and blockade the city , on which , he supposed , tiridates had fallen back
 fabius valens , captive as he was , and reserved against the chance of disaster , was yet too formidable to them and certainly primus , fuscus , and mucianus , who exhibits the temper of his party , will not be allowed power over vitellius except to put him to death
 even the general did not struggle against his reverses he had indeed wholly abandoned all the duties of a soldier , and had again sent an entreaty to corbulo , that he would come with speed to save the standards and eagles , and the name yet left to the unfortunate army
 and the rest are a mere crowd of spiritless cowards
 lupercus in great haste threw across the rhine such legionaries as were on the spot , some ubian troops who were close at hand , and some cavalry of the treveri , who were stationed at no great distance these were accompanied by some batavian horse , who , though they had been long disaffected , yet still simulated loyalty in order that by betraying the romans in the moment of actual conflict they might receive a higher price for their desertion
arpineius and junius relate to the legates what they had heard .
 in a moment agrippina's doors were deserted
 with this force titus entered the enemy's territory , preserving strict order on his march , reconnoitring every spot , and always ready to give battle
 germanicus and drusus for they were still at rome supported haterius agrippa , a relative of germanicus
 it was only lately indeed that quintilius varus was slain , and slavery driven out of germany
 what with disloyal subjects and oppressive rulers , the towns are ill-affected and rife with discord
 the loss however was less than might have been expected from the confusion , for the germans , not venturing to leave the morass , returned to their camp
 in the same year war broke out between the armenians and iberians , and was the cause of very serious disturbances between parthia and rome
 though three years had elapsed since the destruction of sejanus , neither time , intreaties , nor sated gratification , all which have a soothing effect on others , softened tiberius , or kept him from punishing doubtful or forgotten offenses as most flagrant and recent crimes
when departing , he promises that he will return before the end of the seventh day , on which day he was aware corn was due to that legion which was being left in garrison .
 they also wear the skins of wild beasts the tribes on the rhine and danube in a careless fashion , those of the interior with more elegance , as not obtaining other clothing by commerce
 the force , which had to attack the tenth legion , thinking it a hard matter to storm a legionary encampment , surprised some troops , who had gone out , and were busy felling timber , killed the prefect of the camp , five centurions of the first rank , and a few soldiers
 other particulars were given with much exaggeration about the splendour of the banquet and the unrestrained gaiety of the guests
 t
 both men he had hated of old , thrasea on additional grounds , because he had walked out of the senate when agrippina's case was under discussion , as i have already related , and had not given the juvenile games any conspicuous encouragement
 about the same time octavius sagitta , a tribune of the people , who was enamoured to frenzy of pontia , a married woman , bribed her by most costly presents into an intrigue and then into abandoning her husband
convictolitanis increases the evil state of affairs , and goads on the people to fury , that by the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return to propriety .
 verax escaped in the same way
 they secured vicetia by simply passing through it
 they gave it as their opinion , that time ought to be allowed , that the charges ought to be specified , that , odious and guilty as the man might be , he yet ought to be heard , as precedent required
 his wife threw herself in the way of the murderers and was killed with him vitellius made no inquiries into what was going on
 when on her condemnation a reward was being voted to her prosecutor , junius otho , tribune of the people , interposed his veto
and having fought several successful battles and slain all the nobility of the aedui , they had so far surpassed them in power , that they brought over , from the aedui to themselves , a large portion of their dependents and received from them the sons of their leading men as hostages , and compelled them to swear in their public character that they would enter into no design against them ; and held a portion of the neighboring land , seized on by force , and possessed the sovereignty of the whole of gaul .
 the terror occasioned by former battles was very great ; and therefore , they openly talked of surrendering , and argued with attius that he should not suffer the fortune of them all to be ruined by his obstinacy . 
 but now we court foreigners and flatter them , and just as there is a vote of thanks at any one's pleasure , so even more eagerly is a prosecution decided on
 in the course of the night of the 1st of january , the standard-bearer of the 4th legion , coming to the colonia agrippinensis , announced to vitellius , who was then at dinner , the news that the 4th and 18th legions had thrown down the images of galba , and had sworn allegiance to the senate and people of rome
 it is for you and me to take care , that he be not regretted also by the good
 he then turned to individual soldiers , asking them whether they had brought with them their axes and spades and whatever else is used when towns are to be stormed
 there he was received by a pitiless emperor , and soon afterwards was arraigned before the senate in his anguish and in the weariness of old age , and from being unused , as a king , to equality , much less to degradation , not , certainly , from fear of the charges fabricated against him , he ended his life , by his own act or by a natural death
 otho and vitellius it hated equally , vitellius it also feared
 both failed in their object those of vitellius escaped without injury , unnoticed in the vast multitude , knowing none , and themselves unknown
 nothing , however , was so vexatious as the raising of money mucianus , with the perpetual assertion that money was the sinews of war , looked in all questions , not to right or truth , but only to the extent of a man's fortune
 tradition says that armies already wavering and giving way have been rallied by women who , with earnest entreaties and bosoms laid bare , have vividly represented the horrors of captivity , which the germans fear with such extreme dread on behalf of their women , that the strongest tie by which a state can be bound is the being required to give , among the number of hostages , maidens of noble birth
 they are not even kept under arms or within camps
 very noble birth or great services rendered by the father secure for lads the rank of a chief
 the open plain and the light of day revealed their disgrace
the legions , as soon as they reached the plain , halted and faced the enemy .
 for the cohorts on caesar's right wing , through ignorance of the place , followed the direction of that rampart which ran along from the camp to the river , while they were in search of a gate , and imagined that it belonged to the camp . 
 accordingly , having weighed their plans one against each other , they decided that a letter should be written in the prince's name , to the effect that full discharge was granted to those who had served in twenty campaigns that there was a conditional release for those who had served sixteen , and that they were to be retained under a standard with immunity from everything except actually keeping off the enemy
 these extreme and possibly false stories at least had their origin in the general's real severity
he himself , advancing with the legion a little from that place where he had taken his post , awaited the issue of the battle .
 let otho therefore protract the war
 there they were kept in disgrace , and were released only on the intercession of the whole army
 all of us who had no part in his last design , i mean to defend at the peril of myself alone
on his arrival , the bituriges send embassadors to the aedui , under whose protection they were , to solicit aid in order that they might more easily resist the forces of the enemy .
 for otho's had been a neglected boyhood and a riotous youth , and he had made himself agreeable to nero by emulating his profligacy
there was a severe struggle in that place .
volcatius tullus , a young man ; he himself , when the corn began to ripen , having set forth for the war with ambiorix , he sends forward l minucius basilus with all the cavalry , to try if he might gain any advantage by rapid marches and the advantage of time , he warns him to forbid fires being made in the camp , lest any indication of his approach be given at a distance : he tells him that he will follow immediately .
 proceedings were then taken against calpurnius piso , a high-spirited nobleman
 to this he added a few words by way of encouragement , what they might expect from his own liberality , if they should follow him and attius . 
 still the eloquence of the gracchi was not an equivalent to rome for having to endure their legislation , and cicero's fame as an orator was a poor compensation for the death he died
he leaves the five cohorts , which he considered to be the most steady in action , to guard the camp ; he orders the five remaining cohorts of the same legion to proceed a little after midnight up the river with all their baggage , in a great tumult .
when these things were done labienus , left on the continent with three legions and 2 , 000 horse , to defend the harbors and provide corn , and discover what was going on in gaul , and take measures according to the occasion and according to the circumstance ; he himself , with five legions and a number of horse , equal to that which he was leaving on the continent , set sail at sun-set , and borne forward by a gentle south-west wind , he did not maintain his course , in consequence of the wind dying away about midnight , and being carried on too far by the tide , when the sun rose , espied britain passed on his left .
 what will happen , if it flourish and be strong
 this resolution of caesar was not generally approved of ; but the soldiers openly declared to each other that since such an opportunity of victory was let pass , they would not come to an engagement , even when caesar should wish it . 
raising a shout suddenly , that by this intimation those who were beseiged in the town might learn their arrival , they began to cast down hurdles and dislodge our men from the rampart by slings , arrows , and stones , and executed the other movements which are requisite in storming .
 caesar , being uneasy about the retreat of his soldiers , ordered hurdles to be carried to the further side of the hill , and to be placed opposite to the enemy , and behind them a trench of a moderate breadth to be sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles ; and the ground to be made as difficult as possible . 
 calling , as he did , a vice so habitual among men and women by the awful name of sacrilege and treason , he went far beyond the indulgent spirit of our ancestors , beyond indeed his own legislation
 those , on the other hand , who thought that he ought to wait at home , though their opinion of him was the same , hinted that mockeries and insults were in store for him
 thus the reward of a tyrannicide , or the choice of an outraged maiden , or a remedy for a pestilence , or a mother's incest , anything , in short , daily discussed in our schools , never , or but very rarely in the courts , is dwelt on in grand language
 yet the houses were filled with lifeless forms and the streets with funerals
 one of their number , lucius pituanius , was hurled from the rock another , publius marcius , was executed , according to ancient custom , by the consuls outside the esquiline gate , after the trumpets had been bidden to sound
 at the same moment he rose to leave the senate house
 this was political schism , and , should many dare to do the like , it was actual war
 some were gathering round their standards
having met with favorable weather , he set sail a little after midnight , and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent , except two of the ships of burden which could not make the same port which the other ships did , and were carried a little lower down .
 this emboldened the roxolani , a sarmatian tribe , who had destroyed two cohorts in the previous winter , to invade moesia with great hopes of success they had 9000 cavalry , flushed with victory and intent on plunder rather than on fighting
 his funeral was hastily performed
 what checked them in their course of victory was a mischievous struggle among themselves to secure plunder while they forgot the enemy
 your age is such as to be now free from the passions of youth , and such your life that in the past you have nothing to excuse
 the rock terminated in a precipice the towers were raised to a height of sixty feet , where the hill lent its aid to the fortifications , where the ground fell , to a height of one hundred and twenty
 accordingly at daybreak milichus went to the servilian gardens , and , finding the doors shut against him , said again and again that he was the bearer of important and alarming news upon this he was conducted by the gatekeepers to one of nero's freedmen , epaphroditus , and by him to nero , whom he informed of the urgent danger , of the formidable conspiracy , and of all else which he had heard or inferred
 meanwhile paetus threw a bridge over the river arsanias , which flowed by the camp , apparently with the view of facilitating his march it was the parthians , however , who had required this , as an evidence of their victory
therefore , after staying a short time before the town , and laying waste the country of the remi , when all the villages and buildings which they could approach had been burned , they hastened with all their forces to the camp of caesar , and encamped within less than two miles ; and their camp , as was indicated by the smoke and fires , extended more than eight miles in breadth .
the next day , early in the morning , he sent both foot-soldiers and horse in three divisions on an expedition to pursue those who had fled .
 they have , in fact , had recourse to a fleet and to a trackless ocean , that their coming might be unopposed , their flight unpursued
 flattery there was none , for all knew that tiberius could scarcely dissemble his joy at the death of germanicus
 the heads were fixed upon poles and carried about among the standards of the cohorts , close to the eagle of the legion , while those who had struck the blow , those who had been present , those who whether truly or falsely boasted of the act , as of some great and memorable achievement , vied in displaying their bloodstained hands
 reckless adventurers from gaul , emboldened by want , occupied this land of questionable ownership
 their hopes , their rewards , were all uncertain
 whatever we loved , whatever we admired in agricola , survives , and will survive in the hearts of men , in the succession of the ages , in the fame that waits on noble deeds
 soon afterwards one of his own slaves murdered the city-prefect , pedanius secundus , either because he had been refused his freedom , for which he had made a bargain , or in the jealousy of a love in which he could not brook his master's rivalry
 whatever the humour of the day with tiberius , he would assume the like , and his language differed as little
 there having received a blow of a stone thrown from the wall of the town which was commanded by quintus pedius with one legion , he died of it ; and caelius having set out , as he pretended for caesar , went to thurii , where he was put to death as he was tampering with some of the freemen of the town , and was offering money to caesar's gallic and spanish horse , which he had sent there to strengthen the garrison . 
 as the army entered novesium the sixteenth legion joined it
 the senate's favourable bias was an incitement to tiberius to offer prompt opposition , which he did in nearly these words 
 the cretans too demanded a like privilege for a statue of the divine augustus
 again , look at the respectable citizens who escort the pleader to and from the court look at his appearance in public , and the respect shown him before the judges what a delight it must be to rise and stand amid the hushed crowd , with every eye on him alone , the people assembling and gathering round him in a circle , and taking from the orator any emotion he has himself assumed
 but he too , changing his design for reasons not necessary to be mentioned , abandoned the place . 
 in the consulship of aulus vitellius and lucius vipstanus the question of filling up the senate was discussed , and the chief men of gallia comata , as it was called , who had long possessed the rights of allies and of roman citizens , sought the privilege of obtaining public offices at rome
he proves to them that to accomplish their attempts was a thing very easy to be done , because he himself would obtain the government of his own state ; that there was no doubt that the helvetii were the most powerful of the whole of gaul ; he assures them that he will , with his own forces and his own army , acquire the sovereignty for them .
 it is the custom of the states to bestow by voluntary and individual contribution on the chiefs a present of cattle or of grain , which , while accepted as a compliment , supplies their wants
 but the blockade and works round the town prevented his escape . 
 here pompey commanded in person . 
 the suggestion was coldly received , not because the lady loved her husband , but from a fear that silius , after attaining his highest hopes , would spurn an adulteress , and soon estimate at its true value the crime which in the midst of peril he had approved
these things being achieved , while caesar had every reason to suppose that gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity , the belgae being overcome , the germans expelled , the seduni among the alps defeated , and when he had , therefore , in the beginning of winter , set out for illyricum , as he wished to visit those nations , and acquire a knowledge of their countries , a sudden war sprang up in gaul .
 the egyptian priests give this account while ptolemy , the first macedonian king who consolidated the power of egypt , was setting up in the newly-built city of alexandria fortifications , temples , and rites of worship , there appeared to him in his sleep a youth of singular beauty and more than human stature , who counselled the monarch to send his most trusty friends to pontus , and fetch his effigy from that country
 to his freedmen and friends he shewed a forbearance , which , when he had fallen into worthy hands , could not be blamed
having collected together , and provided about eighty transport ships , as many as he thought necessary for conveying over two legions , he assigned such of war as he had besides to the quaestor , his legates , and officers of cavalry .
 caecina , ashamed of the assault on which he had so rashly ventured , and unwilling , ridiculed and baffled as he was , to remain in the same position , again crossed the padus , and resolved on marching to cremona
 hence , the bribing of our allies by alluring promises and the cheating them by tribunes vetoes
 when the enemy first burst in , domitian concealed himself in the house of a servant of the temple at the ingenious suggestion of a freedman , he assumed a linen vestment , and passing unnoticed among a crowd of acolytes , found a refuge with cornelius primus , one of his father's dependants , in a house near the velabrum
 he dwelt on all that was dear to them at home , all that testified to their honour in the camp , without any allusion to disaster
these matters being arranged , finding the weather favorable for his voyage , he set sail about the third watch , and ordered the horse to march forward to the further port , and there embark and follow him .
 marcus lepidus spoke against the sentence as follows 
 the emperor listened , for his affection for his daughter inclined him the more to admit suspicions against his son-in-law
but marcus antonius , and caius trebonius , the lieutenants , to whom the defense of these parts had been allotted , draughted troops from the redoubts which were more remote , and sent them to aid our troops , in whatever direction they understood that they were hard pressed .
 if he did but repel sixty soldiers this was the number on the way , while tidings were being carried back to nero , while another force was on its march , many events would follow which would ripen into war
 but at divodurum , a town of the mediomatrici , though they had been received with the most courteous hospitality , a sudden panic mastered them in a moment they took up arms to massacre an innocent people , not for the sake of plunder , or fired by the lust of spoil , but in a wild frenzy arising from causes so vague that it was very difficult to apply a remedy soothed at length by the entreaties of their general , they refrained from utterly destroying the town
 the guilt of others had been the result of presents or of large promises
 they applied to their tribunes and centurions , and entreated them to inform caesar that he need not spare their labor or consider their danger ; that they were ready and able , and would venture to ford the river where the horse had crossed . 
 in fact , audacity at the moment , and rashness itself , have quite a peculiar sweetness
the shape of these , and the varied color of their skins , is much like roes , but in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns , and have legs without joints and ligatures ; nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest , nor , if they have been thrown down by any accident , can they raise or lift themselves up .
 and , as it happened , so ready were all to suspect , otho felt as much alarm as he inspired
 there she spent a few days to compose her mind , for she was wild with grief and knew not how to endure
 the other lieutenants took the same oath , and the tribunes and centurions followed their example : and the whole army swore in like manner . 
 this severity of yours , replied maternus , would be quite a blow to us , had not our controversy from its frequency and familiarity become by this time almost a regular practice
while he is tarrying a few days at vesontio , on account of corn and provisions ; from the inquiries of our men and the reports of the gauls and traders —so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army , as to discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree .
 though i would allow that there were some few who in their secret wishes prayed for peace in the stead of disorder , for a worthy and blameless emperor in the room of men utterly worthless and wicked , yet i cannot suppose that paullinus , wise as he was , could have hoped in an age thoroughly depraved to find such moderation in the common herd , as that men , who in their passion for war had trampled peace under foot , should now in their affection for peace renounce the charms of war nor can i think that armies differing in language and in character , could have united in such an agreement or that lieutenants and generals , who were for the most part burdened by the consciousness of profligacy , of poverty , and of crime , could have endured any emperor who was not himself stained by vice , as well as bound by obligation to themselves
these things being achieved , all gaul being subdued , so high an opinion of this war was spread among the barbarians , that embassadors were sent to caesar by those nations who dwelt beyond the rhine , to promise that they would give hostages and execute his commands .
 about cerialis , with the object of procuring his murder
 they had been slow to revolt from nero , and verginius had not immediately declared for galba
 part of the cavalry was ordered to make for the rhine along the sea-coast
 harmless measures were for the innocent crime once exposed had no refuge but in audacity
in the whole of this method of fighting since the engagement took place under the eyes of all and before the camp , it was perceived that our men , on account of the weight of their arms , inasmuch as they could neither pursue retreating , nor dare quit their standards , were little suited to this kind of enemy ; that the horse also fought with great danger , because they generally retreated even designedly , and , when they had drawn off our men a short distance from the legions , leaped from their chariots and fought on foot in unequal battle .
 on the following day , as the feeling of otho's army was evident , and those who had been most furious were inclined to repent , envoys were sent , nor did the generals of vitellius hesitate to grant conditions of peace
 these men accordingly talked sedition before small gatherings and popular assemblies about the perpetual tributes , the oppressive usury , the cruelty and arrogance of their governors , hinting too that there was disaffection among our soldiers , since they had heard of the murder of germanicus
 the streets were choked with carnage , the squares and temples reeked with blood , for men were massacred everywhere as chance threw them in the way
and as a great many of the surrounding belgae and other gauls , following caesar , marched with him ; some of these , as was afterwards learned from the prisoners , having accurately observed , during those days , the army's method of marching , went by night to the nervii , and informed them that a great number of baggage-trains passed between the several legions , and that there would be no difficulty , when the first legion had come into the camp , and the other legions were at a great distance , to attack that legion while under baggage , which being routed , and the baggage-train seized , it would come to pass that the other legions would not dare to stand their ground .
 however , the emperor received formal thanks , and still more elaborate flattery was paid to domitius
 nor is this a difficult matter , as we far outnumber them in cavalry . 
 as soon as the proclamation was made , in an instant they all weighed anchor and left utica , and repaired to the place commanded them . 
 both these tribes , as far as the ocean , are skirted by the rhine , and their territory also embraces vast lakes which roman fleets have navigated
 new honours were devised and decreed , as men were inspired by affection for him or by genius
 besides , it is wrong that because of the imbecility of one or two men , all husbands should be cut off from their partners in prosperity and adversity
having repaired the bridge , which the enemy had broken down during the preceding days , he led over his army , and began to march along the banks of the river to lutetia .
 pompey , either frightened at caesar's works or determined from the beginning to quit italy , began to prepare for his departure on the arrival of the ships ; and the more effectually to retard caesar's attack , lest his soldiers should force their way into the town at the moment of his departure , he stopped up the gates , built walls across the streets and avenues , sunk trenches across the ways , and in them fixed palisadoes and sharp stakes , which he made level with the ground by means of hurdles and clay . 
 at lugdunum the generals of the two parties , the conquerors and the conquered , were waiting for him
 the early and severe winter of mount haemus saved the rest of the population from being reduced by assault or blockade
 but on the contrary , vitellius retraced his steps to the palace , the very stronghold of empire
 birds of evil omen perched on the capitol houses were thrown down by frequent shocks of earthquake , and as the panic spread , all the weak were trodden down in the hurry and confusion of the crowd
 that an emperor can be created by the army , vitellius is himself a proof , who , though he had seen no service and had no military reputation , was raised to the throne by the unpopularity of galba
therefore , after having called up to him the merchants from all parts , he could learn neither what was the size of the island , nor what or how numerous were the nations which inhabited it , nor what system of war they followed , nor what customs they used , nor what harbors were convenient for a great number of large ships .
the remi succeeded to their place , and , as it was perceived that they equaled the aedui in favor with caesar , those , who on account of their old animosities could by no means coalesce with the aedui , consigned themselves in clientship to the remi .
there were in all two routes , by which they could go forth from their country one through the sequani narrow and difficult , between mount jura and the river rhone , the other , through our province , much easier and freer from obstacles , because the rhône flows between the boundaries of the helvetii and those of the allobroges , who had lately been subdued , and is in some places crossed by a ford .
the former are engaged in things sacred , conduct the public and the private sacrifices , and interpret all matters of religion .
two days after , ariovistus sends embassadors to caesar , to state that he wished to treat with him about those things which had been begun to be treated of between them , but had not been concluded ; that he would either again appoint a day for a conference ; or , if he were not willing to do that , that he would send one of his as an embassador to him .
in cavalry actions they frequently leap from their horses and fight on foot ; and train their horses to stand still in the very spot on which they leave them , to which they retreat with great activity when there is occasion ; nor , according to their practice , is any thing regarded as more unseemly , or more unmanly , than to use housings .
 being kindly addressed by them , and deluded by an acquaintance with septimius , because in the war with the pirates the latter had commanded a company under him , he embarked in a small boat with a few attendants , and was there murdered by achillas and septimius . 
 vengeance must come from you , if you loved the man more than his fortune
 it was given to drusus by lygdus , a eunuch , as was ascertained eight years later
 while nero was lingering in the towns of campania , doubting how he should enter rome , whether he would find the senate submissive and the populace enthusiastic , all the vilest courtiers , and of these never had a court a more abundant crop , argued against his hesitation by assuring him that agrippina's name was hated and that her death had heightened his popularity
thus , at the same time , the tide began to fill the ships of war which caesar had provided to convey over his army , and which he had drawn up on the strand ; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden which were riding at anchor against each other ; nor was any means afforded our men of either managing them or of rendering any service .
 every one , as he returned from some far-distant region , told of wonders , of violent hurricanes , and unknown birds , of monsters of the sea , of forms half-human , half beast-like , things they had really seen or in their terror believed
 the raised causeway was occupied by three praetorian cohorts , ranged in deep columns
 wherefore , they should have pity on themselves , and the republic : for , from their own misfortunes , they had sufficient experience of what fortune can effect in war . 
 the horse engaged ; but the numidians were not able to stand our first charge ; but a hundred and twenty being killed , the rest retreated into their camp near the town . 
in these matters he employed about ten days , the labor of the soldiers being unremitting even during the hours of night .
 yet he did not fling away life with precipitate haste , but having made an incision in his veins and then , according to his humour , bound them up , he again opened them , while he conversed with his friends , not in a serious strain or on topics that might win for him the glory of courage
 even homicide is expiated by the payment of a certain number of cattle and of sheep , and the satisfaction is accepted by the entire family , greatly to the advantage of the state , since feuds are dangerous in proportion to a people's freedom
 he received hostages from them , and then ordered the commander of the fleet to sail round britain
thus , was the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful success .
 the prince restored the altar , and himself with his legions celebrated funeral games in his father's honour
 caesar had no resource , but to annoy and cut down their rear ; since with his cavalry to go by the bridge , required him to take a long circuit ; so that they would arrive at the ebro by a much shorter route . 
caesar leads off his forces to the next hill : draws them up in battle-order .
 they were driven into civil war by the same wrath from heaven , the same madness among men , the same incentives to crime
 cotta messalinus then proposed that libo's bust should not be carried in the funeral procession of any of his descendants and cneius lentulus , that no scribonius should assume the surname of drusus
these , when there is occasion and any war occurs , are all engaged in war and those of them most distinguished by birth and resources , have the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them .
 old and infirm as he was , it was with anything but eagerness that he listened to these suggestions
 nero was driven from power by evil tidings and rumours rather than by the sword
 for , says he , all the municipal towns afterward imitated you and your conduct ; nor was it without reason that caesar judged so favorably , and the enemy so harshly of you . 
 meanwhile two suggestions were keeping galba in doubt
all these differ from each other in language , customs and laws .
 but afterwards , as the feelings of galba were doubtful , and many senators interceded , priscus dropped the charge , amidst comments varying with the tempers of men , some praising his moderation , and others deploring a lack of courage
 fortune preserved the due order the oldest died first , then the others according to priority of age
 the soldiers obeyed reluctantly
 as for your crispus and marcellus , whom you hold up to me as examples , what is there in their lot to be coveted
 there they fought at close quarters
 when business was done with , he wore no longer the official character
 when they had heard the emperor's letter , the aediles were excused from so anxious a task , and that luxury of the table which from the close of the war ended at actium to the armed revolution in which servius galba rose to empire , had been practised with profuse expenditure , gradually went out of fashion
the same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill six miles from caesar's camp .
from him they received information of the imminent danger of cicero and the legion .
 this even the accused did not refuse , fearing , as he did , the bias of the people and of the senate
 with these were the captured vessels , in which , picturesquely enough , plaids of various colours were used for sails
 the charge of this business was committed to lieutenant fufius kalenus , with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions . 
 what remained for them but to strip themselves naked , put on the boxing-glove , and practise such battles instead of the arms of legitimate warfare
 they must have seen this , those men before unknown to me , both as to the name they bear and the arts they practise
 you did not secure by this piece of barbarity either your rank or your life
 two of the victorious legions , the 6th and 8th , the 21st , which belonged to the vitellianist army , the 2nd , which consisted of new levies , were marched into gaul , some over the penine and cottian , some over the graian alps
 those who were crushed to death in the first moment of the accident had at least under such dreadful circumstances the advantage of escaping torture
 tiberius meantime , while securing to himself the substance of imperial power , allowed the senate some shadow of its old constitution by referring to its investigation certain demands of the provinces
for these successes , a thanksgiving of twenty days was decreed by the senate upon receiving caesar's letter .
 for my own part i shall not scruple to mention men by name , that , with examples before us , we may the more easily perceive the successive steps of the ruin and decay of eloquence
 a very strict discipline and very strict laws prevailed , tradition says , in both those states
when caesar arrived at that place , he demanded hostages , their arms , and the slaves who had deserted to them .
 similar intelligence was received from spain , and cluvius rufus was commended in an edict
 they had lately contended with a superior force , and yet the germans , the strength of the hostile army , had been routed
 having learnt from you what they knew , with which we are unacquainted , i wish also to be told the process of training by which , when mere lads , and when about to enter the forum , they used to strengthen and nourish their intellects
 when the macedonians became supreme , king antiochus strove to destroy the national superstition , and to introduce greek civilization , but was prevented by his war with the parthians from at all improving this vilest of nations
 immediately they ran in crowds to the general's pavilion , when he required them all to take an oath that they would not desert nor betray the army nor the generals , nor form any design distinct from the general interest . 
 accordingly , they slew several , and forced the rest to retreat into the town without effecting their design . 
 the others thanked him
there were in addition to these eighteen ships of burden which were prevented , eight miles from that place , by winds , from being able to reach the same port .
 while courteously receiving valens , he deterred him by his advice from rashly invading gallia narbonensis
 entrenchments had to be thrown up , materials sought for earthworks , while the army had lost to a great extent their implements for digging earth and cutting turf
 i have already spoken of the illustrious rank of domitius
 then , a slave-girl raised above the mistress poppaea married only to insure a wife's ruin , and , to end all , an accusation more horrible than any death
 in the consulship of caius suetonius and lucius telesinus , antistius sosianus , who , as i have stated , had been punished with exile for repeated satires on nero , having heard that there was such honour for informers and that the emperor was so partial to bloodshed , being himself too of a restless temper and quick to seize opportunities , made a friend of a man in like condition with himself , one pammenes , an exile in the same place , noted for his skill as an astrologer , and consequently bound to many in close intimacy
these are a little below the elephant in size , and of the appearance , color , and shape of a bull .
 not long after his freedman onomastus informed him that the architect and the contractors were waiting for him it had been arranged thus to indicate that the soldiers were assembling , and that the preparations of the conspiracy were complete
 husbands have often been corrupted by the vices of their wives
there in like manner , vercingetorix the son of celtillus the arvernian , a young man of the highest power , summoned together his dependents , and easily excited them .
 piso without further delay weighed anchor , slackening his course that he might not have a long way to return should germanicus' death leave syria open to him
 there were forty thousand , one fifth armed like our legionaries the rest had spears and knives and other weapons used in the chase
 it was observed that when all the senate rushed out to antium to honour the recent birth , thrasea was forbidden to go , and received with fearless spirit an affront which foreboded his doom
 since then everything has been favourable to us , and against the foe all precautions , which the skill of a general should take , have been taken
 first came angry words , then a brawl between the batavi and the legionaries , which as the partialities of the soldiers espoused one or another of the parties was almost kindled into a battle , and would have been so , had not valens by punishing a few , reminded batavi of the authority which they had now forgotten
 tiridates meantime who , besides his own dependencies , had the powerful aid of his brother vologeses , ravaged armenia , not in stealthy raids as before , but in open war , plundering all whom he thought loyal to rome , while he eluded an action with any force which was brought against him , and thus flying hither and thither , he spread panic more widely by rumour than by arms
 these matters being settled , reinforcements of horse and foot were demanded from lusitania , by petreius ; from the celtiberi , cantabri , and all the barbarous nations which border on the ocean , by afranius . 
 though his road to preferment was easy , he chose to emulate maecenas , and without rising to a senator's rank , he surpassed in power many who had won triumphs and consulships he was a contrast to the manners of antiquity in his elegance and refinement , and in the sumptuousness of his wealth he was almost a voluptuary
 again , is there an accomplishment , the fame and glory of which are to be compared with the distinction of the orator , who is an illustrious man at rome , not only with the busy class , intent on public affairs , but even with people of leisure , and with the young , those at least who have a right disposition and a worthy confidence in themselves
 thus they were assailed by promises as well as by threats , were told that they were not strong enough for war , but would lose nothing by peace
 as the healing art is of very little use and makes very little progress in nations which enjoy particularly robust constitutions and vigorous frames , so the orator gets an inferior and less splendid renown where a sound morality and willing obedience to authority prevail
he writes in the letter , that he having set out with his legions , will quickly be there : he entreats him to maintain his ancient valor .
 and so as the decisive crisis drew near , that he ought thoroughly to sound the temper of his soldiers , he considered with himself how this was to be accomplished with a genuine result
 his youth , his spirits , his former good fortune and confidence of success , contributed much to confirm this resolution . 
 but this espionage became too searching , and rome and italy and roman citizens everywhere fell into its clutches many men's fortunes were ruined , and over all there hung a terror till tiberius , to provide a remedy , selected by lot five ex-consuls , five ex-praetors , and five senators , by whom most of the legal knots were disentangled and some light temporary relief afforded
those states which are considered to conduct their commonwealth more judiciously , have it ordained by their laws , that , if any person shall have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any thing concerning the commonwealth , he shall convey it to the magistrate , and not impart it to any other ; because it has been discovered that inconsiderate and inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports , and driven to some rash act , or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance .
 hence ensued a great mortality in the ranks the tiber was close at hand , and their extreme eagerness for the water and their impatience of the heat weakened the constitutions of the germans and gauls , always liable to disease
 again asia , it was said , from its partiality for the young man , had taken up arms , and the soldiers sent to do the crime , not being sufficient in number or decided in purpose , and , finding themselves unable to execute their orders , had gone over to the new cause
 it was stationed at an island opposite to massilia . 
 its air in winter is soft , as it is screened by a mountain which is a protection against cutting winds
 no one cared about the amount of the tax , or the way in which it was raised
 pulchra's name is a mere blind the only reason for her destruction is that she has , in utter folly , selected agrippina for her admiration , forgetting that sosia was thereby ruined
there was , as we have above observed , no regular army , nor a town , nor a garrison which could defend itself by arms ; but the people were scattered in all directions .
 this increased caesar's alarm
 that these priests in former days were prohibited by the pontiff from going into the provinces , was the result of private feuds
 she was then tightly bound with cords , and the veins of every limb were opened
 the men were quite ready and prepared to form in line of battle according to their marching order
 and he wished to know all his saying and doings , though it was in his power to stop them , till one junius , who had been tampered with by libo for the purpose of evoking by incantations spirits of the dead , gave information to fulcinius trio
 but so great a store of every thing necessary for a war had been a long time before laid up in the town , and so great a number of engines , that no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force . 
 no parents to taunt them with flight
besides that the interests of private property must be neglected for the sake of the general safety ; that the villages and houses ought to be fired , over such an extent of country in every direction from boia , as the romans appeared capable of scouring in their search for forage .
 advance , he said , and hasten to turn your guilt into glory
 he would go about without soldiers , with sandalled feet , and apparelled after the greek fashion , in imitation of publius scipio , who , it is said , habitually did the same in sicily , even when the war with carthage was still raging
dumnorix , by his popularity and liberality , had great influence among the sequani , and was friendly to the helvetii , because out of that state he had married the daughter of orgetorix ; and , incited by lust of sovereignty , was anxious for a revolution , and wished to have as many states as possible attached to him by his kindness toward them .
 there were indeed in the territory of the lingones eight batavian cohorts , which formed the auxiliary force of the 14th legion , but which had , among the many dissensions of the time , withdrawn from it a body of troops which , to whatever side they might incline , would , whether as allies or enemies , throw a vast weight into the scale
 where the strong hand decides , moderation and justice are terms applied only to the more powerful
 having crossed the danube where it flows by the province of noricum , he wrote to tiberius , not like a fugitive or a suppliant , but as one who remembered his past greatness
 among the vitellianists treason went unpunished all loyalty was subverted by the rewards of desertion , and nothing was left but emulation in perfidy
 herennius gallus , its legate , was associated with vocula in the responsibilities of command
 we have now taught them to accept money also
 in ptolemy's army were several of pompey's soldiers , of whom gabinius had received the command in syria , and had brought them over to alexandria , and at the conclusion of the war had left with ptolemy the father of the young king . 
 tiberius too thoroughly understood the art of balancing words , and was sometimes forcible in the expression of his thoughts , or else intentionally obscure
 nothing , he said , allowed of accidents so much as the sea , and should she be overtaken by shipwreck , who would be so unfair as to impute to crime an offence committed by the winds and waves
 meanwhile , in britain , publius ostorius , the propraetor , found himself confronted by disturbance the enemy had burst into the territories of our allies with all the more fury , as they imagined that a new general would not march against them with winter beginning and with an army of which he knew nothing
after launching these , because he had a large number of prisoners , and some of the ships had been lost in the storm , he determines to convey back his army at two embarkations .
 thereupon lucius pomponius , who was in command , directed the vangiones and nemetes , with the allied cavalry , to anticipate the raid , and suddenly to fall upon them from every quarter while they were dispersed
 and both these officers were wavering in their allegiance
 when most people expressed their surprise at it , i know , says he , that i promise a thing almost incredible ; but hear the plan on which i proceed , that you may march to battle with more confidence and resolution . 
 it rests with you to determine what will be the result to my family and to the state it is not that i dread on my own account the gloomier issue for i have known adversity , and i am learning at this very moment that prosperity is fully as dangerous
 is there really , they said , no native of this country to fill the place of king without raising the son of the spy flavus above all his fellows
 all the best men acquiesced in the order , while the ill-affected were struck with terror
 on the rights of ambassadors , on the dreadful and undeserved peril of plancus , and also on the disgrace into which the legion had brought itself , he dwelt with the eloquence of pity , and while the throng was confounded rather than appeased , he dismissed the envoys with an escort of auxiliary cavalry
 civilis collected at one of the sacred groves , ostensibly for a banquet , the chiefs of the nation and the boldest spirits of the lower class when he saw them warmed with the festivities of the night , he began by speaking of the renown and glory of their race , and then counted the wrongs and the oppressions which they endured , and all the other evils of slavery
gaul being tranquil , caesar , as he had determined , sets out for italy to hold the provincial assizes .
 the light cohorts will be enough for me
having seized upon about fifty ships and quickly joined them together , and having placed soldiers in them , he intimidated by his unexpected arrival the inhabitants , of whom a great number had been called out to the war , and obtains possession of the town without a contest .
 should there be no issue , the next in succession to the property are his brothers and his uncles on either side
 before long , however , they returned , and the camp was thrown open
when neither army began to pass the marsh , caesar , upon the skirmishes of the horse favorable to our men , led back his forces into the camp .
 but nero , impatient at such slow progress in crime , threatened the tribune and ordered the poisoner to execution for prolonging his anxiety while they were thinking of the popular talk and planning their own defence
 at the same time he looked back to caesar , and said , general , i will act in such a manner to-day , that you will feel grateful to me living or dead . 
although caesar anticipated that the same thing which had happened on former occasions would then occur-that , if the enemy were routed , they would escape from danger by their speed ; still , having got about thirty horse , which commius the atrebatian , of whom mention has been made , had brought over with him , he drew up the legions in order of battle before the camp .
a supplication of twenty-days is decreed by the senate at rome , on learning these successes from caesar's dispatches .
 for all were bewildered , and those too , who were in the plot , were hindered by the unconscious majority
 corbulo meanwhile having demolished artaxata thought that he ought to avail himself of the recent panic by possessing himself of tigranocerta , and either , by destroying it , increase the enemy's terror , or , by sparing it , win a name for mercy thither he marched his army , with no hostile demonstrations , lest might cut off all hope of quarter , but still without relaxing his vigilance , knowing , as he did , the fickle temper of the people , who are as treacherous , when they have an opportunity , as they are slow to meet danger
our men , not anticipating it , are perplexed by the sudden affair , and the cohort on the outpost scarcely sustains the first attack .
 rage against the place , which indeed had also revolted from his father , rather than considerations of policy , made him embarrass himself with the siege of a strong city , which the defence of a river flowing by it , with fortifications and supplies , had thoroughly secured
 classicus also gained a victory over some cavalry , who had been sent on to novesium by cerialis
 but they refuse to give any , or to shut their gates against the consul , or to take upon them to judge contrary to what all italy and the roman people had judged . 
this work , with respect to appearance and variety , is not unsightly , owing to the alternate rows of beams and stones , which preserve their order in right lines ; and , besides , it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defense of cities ; for the stone protects it from fire , and the wood from the battering ram , since it being mortised in the inside with rows of beams , generally forty feet each in length , can neither be broken through nor torn asunder .
 how again the dagger and its work were to be kept secret , no one could suggest , and it was feared too that whoever might be chosen to execute such a crime would spurn the order
in the mean time the whole body of the suessiones , after their flight , came the next night into the town .
 caesar having possessed himself of pompey's camp , urged his soldiers not to be too intent on plunder , and lose the opportunity of completing their conquest . 
 all nations and cities are ruled by the people , the nobility , or by one man
 the number of slaves of every nationality
 nay , they actually think it tame and stupid to acquire by the sweat of toil what they might win by their blood
 the standards were then to be advanced , so that thus at least the cohorts might be distinguished
 they transact no public or private business without being armed
 during nero's second consulship with lucius piso for his colleague , little occurred deserving mention , unless one were to take pleasure in filling volumes with the praise of the foundations and timber work on which the emperor piled the immense amphitheatre in the field of mars but we have learnt that it suits the dignity of the roman people to reserve history for great achievements , and to leave such details to the city's daily register
 could augustus , with the feebleness of age on him , so often visit germany , and is tiberius , in the vigour of life , to sit in the senate and criticise its members' words
but caesar , although he had not as yet discovered their measures , yet , both from what had occurred to his ships , and from the circumstance that they had neglected to give the promised hostages , suspected that the thing would come to pass which really did happen .
 they call those profane who make representations of god in human shape out of perishable materials they believe that being to be supreme and eternal , neither capable of representation , nor of decay they therefore do not allow any images to stand in their cities , much less in their temples
 for he is said to have had by no means a dull understanding and this is either a fact , or perhaps his perils won him sympathy , and so he possessed the credit of it , without actual evidence
 rome at the beginning was ruled by kings
 something greater and loftier is expected of a prince , and while everybody takes to himself the credit of right policy , one alone has to bear the odium of every person's failures
 in my position it is perhaps less to my advantage to acknowledge than to deny the charge
 we do not disparage the guards of the capital
it had happened for several reasons that the gauls suddenly formed the design of renewing the war and cutting off that legion first , because they despised a single legion , on account of its small number , and that not quite full ; then , likewise , because they thought that on account of the disadvantageous character of the situation , even their first attack could not be sustained when they would rush from the mountains into the valley , and discharge their weapons upon us .
 he was a man naturally tardy in action , and one who preferred a cautious and scientific plan of operations to any success which was the result of accident he ordered the trenches to be filled up , the plain to be cleared , and the line to be extended , holding that it would be time enough to begin his victory when he had provided against being vanquished
 at this part of the river , they ordered a bridge to be made of boats fastened together , and transported two legions over the river segre , and fortified their camp with a rampart , twelve feet high . 
 after this action , the roman citizens , who resided at lissus , a town which caesar had before assigned them , and had carefully fortified , received antony into their town , and gave him every assistance . 
 there were borne in procession spoils , prisoners , representations of the mountains , the rivers and battles
 after uttering these words he charged first on the right wing , and about one hundred and twenty chosen volunteers of the same century followed . 
 a cypress tree of remarkable height on his estate had suddenly fallen , and rising again the following day on the very same spot , had flourished with majestic beauty and even broader shade
 he then tried the knife with his aged hand , but again bound up his veins , opening them once more however on having begged for pardon by letter and received a pitiless answer after him a host of persons were charged with treason , annius pollio , appius silanus , scaurus mamercus , sabinus calvisius , vinicianus too , coupled with pollio , his father , men all of illustrious descent , some too of the highest political distinction
this proposal receiving general approbation , and all being forced to take the oath , on the next day the cavalry were divided into three parts , and two of these divisions made a demonstration on our two flanks ; while one in front began to obstruct our march .
 this beginning of popularity and the ill-concealed ambition of their mother agrippina , hastened its downfall
 but those who profess inviolable truthfulness must speak of all without partiality and without hatred
 that these were the sentiments of low , weak minds : that for his part , as he had made it his study to surpass others in glory , so he was desirous of excelling them in justice and equity . 
 peace and quiet are known and welcomed only at these times , till the goddess , weary of human intercourse , is at length restored by the same priest to her temple
 at the same time , domitius arrived in macedonia : and when numerous embassies had begun to wait on him from many of the states , news was brought that scipio was approaching with his legions , which occasioned various opinions and reports ; for in strange events , rumor generally goes before . 
 though they were fatigued by the intense heat , for the battle had continued till mid-day , yet , being prepared to undergo any labor , they cheerfully obeyed his command . 
caesar , having given the necessary orders , hastened to and fro into whatever quarter fortune carried him , to animate the troops , and came to the tenth legion .
 why , it was asked , was no one else chosen to put his tongue at the service of that savage harlot
 meanwhile the mother's influence was gradually weakened , as nero fell in love with a freedwoman , acte by name , and took into his confidence otho and claudius senecio , two young men of fashion , the first of whom was descended from a family of consular rank , while senecio's father was one of the emperor's freedmen
 those built of stone are despised as mere tombs , if the judgment of posterity passes into hatred
 caesar thought this a great honour to himself , and loaded vonones with wealth
 the germans , besides inflicting great loss on our men , carried off the vessel
 meantime , from the continued inaction of our armies , a rumour prevailed that the commanders had been deprived of the right of leading them against the enemy
 soon afterwards news came that the numidians had fixed their tents and encamped near a half-demolished fortress , by name auzea , to which they had themselves formerly set fire , and on the position of which they relied , as it was inclosed by vast forests
 he has not ordered his mother's murder
 although i have followed most historians in attributing the cause of his retirement to the arts of sejanus , still , as he passed six consecutive years in the same solitude after that minister's destruction , i am often in doubt whether it is not to be more truly ascribed to himself , and his wish to hide by the place of his retreat the cruelty and licentiousness which he betrayed by his actions some thought that in his old age he was ashamed of his personal appearance
thus fortune tended much both toward his encountering and his escaping danger .
 his origin , i grant , was more illustrious than ours
there are also which are called elks .
 free from the usual burdens and contributions , and set apart for fighting purposes , like a magazine of arms , we reserve them for our wars
 under pretence of helping the emperor's efforts to vomit , this man , it is supposed , introduced into his throat a feather smeared with some rapid poison for he knew that the greatest crimes are perilous in their inception , but well rewarded after their consummation
 you often ask me , justus fabius , how it is that while the genius and the fame of so many distinguished orators have shed a lustre on the past , our age is so forlorn and so destitute of the glory of eloquence that it scarce retains the very name of orator
 you , whose fortune never suffered a reverse , may keep back the legions
 and when they wished to retire they were again attacked by the enemy from the rising ground . 
embassies are sent by them in all directions : as far as they can prevail by influence , authority , or money , they strive to excite the state .
caesar , having stationed his army on both sides of the fortifications , in order that , if occasion should arise , each should hold and know his own post , orders the cavalry to issue forth from the camp and commence action .
 the next night two marsian centurions with twenty-two men belonging to the companies , deserted from curio's camp to attius varus . 
 the vats were overflowing women girt with skins were dancing , as bacchanals dance in their worship or their frenzy
divitiacus urged by this necessity , had proceeded to rome to the senate , for the purpose of entreating assistance , and had returned without accomplishing his object .
 to persist in inaction , and to leave the state to degradation and ruin , would look like indolence and cowardice , even supposing that servitude were as safe for you as it would be infamous
 after the capture of caractacus , venutius of the brigantes , as i have already mentioned , was pre-eminent in military skill he had long been loyal to rome and had been defended by our arms while he was united in marriage to the queen cartismandua
 afterwards , on his own accession to the imperial power , he consecrated a vast temple to jupiter the guardian , with an effigy of himself in the arms of the god
 the troops indeed complained in unmistakable language that their general had despatched the batavian cohorts from mogontiacum , had feigned ignorance of the plans of civilis , and was inviting the german tribes to join the league
 though surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes , they are safe , not by submitting , but by daring the perils of war
 these fortifications he increased during the succeeding days , that he might have them before him as a rampart , and not be obliged to fight against his will . 
 the occurrence of the fair filled the colony , rich as it always was , with an appearance of still greater wealth
 caius considius longus , with a garrison of one legion , guarded this town . 
 the alarm was heightened by the knowledge that the enemy was aware of the roman mutiny , and would certainly attack if the rhine bank were undefended
at length , each thigh of t balventius , who the year before had been chief centurion , a brave man and one of great authority , is pierced with a javelin ; q lucanius , of the same rank , fighting most valiantly , is slain while he assists his son when surrounded by the enemy ; l .
 the soldiers of the 14th legion were peculiarly furious
 their missiles were discharged without effect in the darkness , but to the romans the ranks of the barbarians were plainly discernible , and they singled out with deliberate aim anyone whose boldness or whose decorations made him conspicuous
 two parts of this were occupied by the armies , and one third left for the soldiers to charge and make their attack . 
 this , he added , was also the request of torquata , silanus's sister , a vestal of primitive purity
 it is to your valour that they look , in you these better counsels find all their support , without you , noble as they may be , they are powerless
the germans differ much from these usages , for they have neither druids to preside over sacred offices , nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices .
 for retreat was prevented by the multitude of the fugitives in that battle , when the eagle-bearer was dangerously wounded , and began to grow weak , having got sight of our horse , he said to them , this eagle have i defended with the greatest care for many years , at the hazard of my life , and now in my last moments restore it to caesar with the same fidelity . 
indutiomarus disappointed in this expectation , nevertheless began to raise troops , and discipline them , and procure horses from the neighboring people , and allure to him by great rewards the outlaws and convicts throughout gaul .
 the third legion , as it had passed over from syria to moesia , vespasian counted upon as devoted to himself , and it was hoped that the other legions of illyricum would follow its example
the gauls , after the interval of a day and after making , during that time , an immense number of hurdles , scaling-ladders , and iron hooks , silently went forth from the camp at midnight and approached the fortifications in the plain .
 but when he marched away towards the coast and , hampered with booty , fixed himself in a regular camp , caesianus was despatched by his father apronius with some cavalry and auxiliary infantry , reinforced by the most active of the legionaries , and , after a successful battle with the numidians , drove them into the desert
 it was to mirth rather than to profligacy that a few nights every five years were devoted , and in these amid such a blaze of illumination no lawless conduct could be concealed
 you should not yield the glory of the war to antonius and varus
 that he might have no hindrance in throwing a bridge over it from the enemy's cavalry , which was already scouring the adjoining plains with a formidable display , he launched on the river some vessels of remarkable size , linked together by beams , with towers rising from their decks , and with catapults and balistas he drove off the barbarians
 martialis had hardly returned to the capitol , when the infuriated soldiery arrived , without any leader , every man acting on his own impulse
 our men , alarmed at such an unexpected turn of fortune , lay hold on such arms as they could find . 
 the troops there were even more enraged against hordeonius , and laid on him the blame of the late disaster
 though the fortune of war was against them , they penetrated the vitellianist lines
then caesar , making a sally from all the gates , and sending out the cavalry , soon puts the enemy to flight , so that no one at all stood his ground with the intention of fighting ; and he slew a great number of them , and deprived all of their arms .
 at this same time , vannius , whom drusus caesar had made king of the suevi , was driven from his kingdom in the commencement of his reign he was renowned and popular with his countrymen but subsequently , with long possession , he became a tyrant , and the enmity of neighbours , joined to intestine strife , was his ruin
 their horses are remarkable neither for beauty nor for fleetness
 coming upon them at dawn , they killed many before they could arm
 finally , helvidius may rival the catos and the bruti of old in constancy and courage
 from earliest infancy , perilous vicissitudes were his lot
 as it was , they thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect they plundered the baggage of the fugitives , and they killed a centurion , lucilius , to whom , with soldiers' humour , they had given the name bring another , because when he had broken one vine-stick on a man's back , he would call in a loud voice for another and another
 others describe them as an assyrian horde who , not having sufficient territory , took possession of part of egypt , and founded cities of their own in what is called the hebrew country , lying on the borders of syria
 it would well become sabinus to keep the empire for his brother , and vespasian equally well , to count his other adherents inferior to sabinus
 scaurus , as befitted the old house of the aemilii , forestalled the fatal sentence at the persuasion of his wife sextia , who urged him to die and shared his death
moreover , ariovistus , for his part , had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance , that he was felt to be quite insufferable .
 yet as proconsul of gallia narbonensis he administered the government with strict integrity
 to these were added dardanians and bessians , some of them mercenaries ; others procured by power and influence : also , macedonians , thessalians , and troops from other nations and states , which completed the number which we mentioned before . 
 hence , too , the same physical peculiarities throughout so vast a population
when almost all the state had assembled there , and he was informed that one brother had been declared magistrate by the other , when only a few persons were privately summoned for the purpose , at a different time and place from what he ought , whereas the laws not only forbade two belonging to one family to be elected magistrates while each was alive , but even deterred them from being in the senate , he compelled cotus to resign his office ; he ordered convictolitanis , who had been elected by the priests , according to the usage of the state , in the presence of the magistrates , to hold the supreme authority .
 they were determined to endure every hardship , and their greatest distress was the want of corn . 
 or if any of our officials give promise of such energy and strictness as can stem the corruption , i praise the man , and i confess that i am relieved of a portion of my burdens
 a bridge of boats having been constructed and the army having crossed , the first to enter the camp was ornospades , with several thousand cavalry formerly an exile , he had rendered conspicuous aid to tiberius in the completion of the dalmatic war , and had for this been rewarded with roman citizenship subsequently , he had again sought the friendship of his king , by whom he had been raised to high honour , and appointed governor of the plains , which , being surrounded by the waters of those famous rivers , the euphrates and tigris , have received the name of mesopotamia
 his image in ivory was to head the procession in the games of the circus no flamen or augur , except from the julian family , was to be chosen in the room of germanicus
 they had themselves no skill in handling them , but the prisoners and deserters taught them to pile up timber in the shape of a bridge , under which they put wheels , and so propelled it , some standing on the top , and fighting as they would from an earth-work , others concealing themselves within and undermining the walls
 cerialis then convoked an assembly of the treveri and lingones , and thus addressed them 
 they bade him be of good cheer , telling him that he had still fresh forces , and that they would themselves endure and dare to the last
 the man always walked in front of the person whose science tiberius had determined to test , through an unfrequented and precipitous path for the house stood on rocks , and then , if any suspicion had arisen of imposture or of trickery , he hurled the astrologer , as he returned , into the sea beneath , that no one might live to betray the secret
 the legionary soldiers had a tolerable supply of corn , because they had beef ordered to bring from ilerda sufficient to last twenty-two days ; the spanish and auxiliary forces had none , for they had but few opportunities of procuring any , and their bodies were not accustomed to bear burdens ; and therefore a great number of them came over to caesar every day . 
 for my part , i sorrow for my son and shall always sorrow for him
when he perceived that our men were not inferior , as the place before the camp was naturally convenient and suitable for marshaling an army ; on either side of that hill he drew a cross trench of about four hundred paces , and at the extremities of that trench built forts , and placed there his military engines , lest , after he had marshaled his army , the enemy , since they were so powerful in point of number , should be able to surround his men in the flank , while fighting .
 soldiers , who bore auspicious names , entered the precincts with sacred boughs
 two hundred were sent from syria by comagenus antiochus , whom pompey rewarded amply . 
 on approaching the woods , they rallied , and its they knew the ground , they were able to pounce on the foremost and least cautious of the pursuers
 for example , the people of smyrna quoted an oracle of apollo , which had commanded them to dedicate a temple to venus stratonicis and the islanders of tenos , an utterance from the same deity , bidding them consecrate a statue and a fane to neptune
 the facilities for selling were followed by a fall of prices , and the deeper a man was in debt , the more reluctantly did he part with his property , and many were utterly ruined
the enemy being thus vanquished in battle , as soon as they recovered after their flight , instantly sent embassadors to caesar to negotiate about peace .
 the admiration of the beholders was heightened by the striking comeliness of the general and the chariot which bore his five children
 my soul shudders at the imagination of so horrible a crime will you mount guard for tutor , the trever shall a batavian give the signal for battle will you serve as recruits in the german battalions what will be the issue of your wickedness when the roman legions are marshalled against you will you be a second time deserters , a second time traitors , and brave the anger of heaven while you waver between your old and your new allegiance
 it was almost eleven o'clock , when a horseman arrived at full speed with the news , that the enemy were approaching , that a small body was moving in front , but that the stir and noise could be heard far and wide
others have figures of vast size , the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men , which being set on fire , the men perish enveloped in the flames .
 it was a kind of bargain the soldiers had their licence , the general had his life and so the mutiny cost no bloodshed
 vitellius wrote to titianus , otho's brother , threatening him and his son with death , unless the lives of his mother and his children were spared both families remained uninjured
 he then addressed the senate in a speech of studied grandiloquence , and was extolled by the senators with elaborate adulation
 dragged out of his tent , his garments torn , and his person severely beaten , he was commanded to declare for what bribe and with what accomplices he had betrayed the army
 at the funeral the mutinous spirit of the soldiers was kindled afresh by their sorrow and regret , and there was no one to check them
 one could not distinguish between aliens and kinsfolk , between friends and strangers , or say what was quite recent , or what half-forgotten from lapse of time
 deeds only were liable to accusation
and that broken by such engagements and calamities , although they had formerly been very powerful in gaul , both from their own valor and from the roman people's hospitality and friendship , they were now compelled to give the chief nobles of their state , as hostages to the sequani , and to bind their state by an oath , that they would neither demand hostages in return , nor supplicate aid from the roman people , nor refuse to be forever under their sway and empire .
 soon , as their license increased , they began to search for and drag forth hidden foes
 what is to be the end of our strifes
 the moderation of wiser men put an end to the dispute
 tiberius perceived it , and having paused a while , said that he had given hortalus his answer , but that if the senators thought it right , he would bestow two hundred thousand sesterces on each of his children of the male sex
 he ordered publius sabinus , prefect of the praetorian guard , to be thrown into prison , because of his friendship with caecina , and substituted in his place alfenius varus
 a space was enclosed in the vatican valley where he might manage his horses , without the spectacle being public
therefore , having stayed about twenty-five days in that place , because the north wind , which usually blows a great part of every season , prevented the voyage , he exerted himself to keep dumnorix in his allegiance nevertheless learn all his measures : having at length met with favorable weather , he orders the foot soldiers and the horse to embark in the ships .
 it is a small matter not to be ill
 levies were made throughout italy , arms demanded , and money exacted from the municipal towns , and violently taken from the temples . 
 but he was more than ever on dangerous ground after his marriage with julia , whether he tolerated or escaped from his wife's profligacy
 to raise a new barrow was not thought necessary
 and when the fire began to spread wider by the violence of the wind , the soldiers of the veteran legions , who had been left to guard the fleet , being considered as invalids , could not endure the disgrace , but of themselves went on board the ships and weighed anchor , and having attacked cassius's fleet , captured two five-banked galleys , in one of which was cassius himself ; but he made his escape by taking to a boat . 
 then they promised that death should be as sudden as if it were the hurried work of the dagger , and a rapid poison of previously tested ingredients was prepared close to the emperor's chamber
 beyond question the law was beaten , but not at once , and only by a few votes , in the same way as laws were defeated even when they were in force
 on the 14th of march , after commending the state to the care of the senate , he presented to those who had been recalled from exile what was left of the neronian confiscations , or had not yet been paid into the imperial treasury , a most equitable and apparently most splendid piece of liberality , but practically worthless , as the property had been hastily realized long before
 vibullius , being informed by him of the transactions in picenum , takes his soldiers from him and dismisses him . 
 nearly at the time when the greatest part of the work was completed , all the messengers sent to pompey returned . 
 they say that hercules , too , once visited them and when going into battle , they sing of him first of all heroes
 there was in the senate one junius rusticus , who having been appointed by the emperor to register its debates was therefore supposed to have an insight into his secret purposes
 at the same time the passes of the alps were occupied with troops , for it was suspected that germany was arming itself to support vitellius
 with these attendants he hastened his flight into the remote country on the borders of scythia , in the hope of aid , as he was connected by marriage alliances with the hyrcanians and carmanians
he sends quintus titurius sabinus his legate , with three legions , among the venelli , the coriosolitae , and the lexovii , to take care that their forces should be kept separate from the rest .
 in our day the judge anticipates the speaker , and unless he is charmed and imposed on by the train of arguments , or the brilliancy of the thoughts , or the grace and elegance of the descriptive sketches , he is deaf to his eloquence
 his family on the mother's side was of less distinction , but yet respectable what his boyhood and his youth had been , we have already shewn
 against it nero has taken no precaution
 the legions , which had been removed , as i have before related , from novesium and bonna to the territory of the treveri , voluntarily swore allegiance to vespasian
 vibillius , king of the hermunduri , and vangio and sido , sons of a sister of vannius , led the movement
 a great part of judaea consists of scattered villages
 he directed that the territories of the ubii and the treveri should be ravaged by the several tribes on which they bordered , and that another detachment should cross the river mosa , to threaten the menapii and the morini and the frontiers of gaul
 by this selection on the part of the senate the emperor will , so to speak , be advised whom he should mark with approval , and from whom he should shrink
 the act was thought cruel at the moment , but subsequently it redounded to his honour when suillius returned from exile
 next , with thorough insight into the feelings of his province , and taught also , by the experience of others , that little is gained by conquest if followed by oppression , he determined to root out the causes of war
 it is hard to say whether the envoys from helvetia found the emperor or his army less merciful exterminate the race , was the cry of the soldiers as they brandished their weapons , or shook their fists in the faces of the envoys
 when upon this the tencteri stood aloof , the bructeri were cowed by a like terror
 afterwards this kind of death became a common practice among all ranks at bedriacum , at placentia , and in the other camps
 upon which intelligence cassius departed with his fleet from that coast . 
 and indeed your gifts to me will , as long as life holds out , be lasting possessions
 the soldiers having obtained by their absence a free opportunity of conversing with each other , came out in great numbers , and inquired each for whatever acquaintance or fellow-citizen he had in our camp , and invited him to him . 
 it is indeed the peculiarity of a cavalry force quickly to win and as quickly to yield a victory
 for , though to survive until the dawn of this most happy age and to see a trajan on the throne was what he would speculate upon in previsions and wishes confided to my ears , yet he had this mighty compensation for his premature death , that he was spared those later years during which domitian , leaving now no interval or breathing space of time , but , as it were , with one continuous blow , drained the life-blood of the commonwealth
they were descended from the cimbri and teutones , who , when they were marching into our province and italy , having deposited on this side the river rhine such of their baggage-trains as they could not drive or convey with them , left 6 , 000 of their men as a guard and defense for them .
 the legion and the auxiliaries stationed in africa to guard the frontiers of the empire were under the proconsul's authority during the reigns of the divine augustus and tiberius
having , therefore , cut down the trunks of trees or very thick branches , and having stripped their tops of the bark , and sharpened them into a point , he drew a continued trench every where five feet deep .
 but julius frontinus was equal to the burden , a great man as far as greatness was then possible , who subdued by his arms the powerful and warlike tribe of the silures , surmounting the difficulties of the country as well as the valour of the enemy
 but the ferocity , which in the first impulse of hatred could be gratified only by blood , soon passed into the greed of gain
 even with the husband's personal vigilance the marriage tie is scarcely preserved inviolate
by all these circumstances the cavalry of the treviri were much alarmed , , and , when they saw our camp filled with a large number of the enemy , the legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded , the camp-retainers , horsemen , slingers , and numidians fleeing on all sides divided and scattered , they , despairing of our affairs , hastened home , and related to their state that the romans were routed and conquered , that the enemy were in possession of their camp and baggage-train .
 how few , when they visit the capital from spain or asia , to say nothing of our gallic neighbours , ask after saleius bassus ! and indeed , if any one does ask after him , having once seen him , he passes on , and is satisfied , as if he had seen a picture or a statue
 similar arguments were used by the inhabitants of interamna
 they advanced in front of the standards , and hurried on the standard-bearers
 as they spoke , they pointed to fortresses amid rocks whither they had conveyed their parents and their wives , and threatened us with a difficult , dangerous and sanguinary war
 pompey had taken the short road to macedonia , through candavia to this was added another unexpected disadvantage , that domitius , who for several days had been encamped opposite scipio , had quitted that post for the sake of provisions , and had marched to heraclea sentica , a city subject to candavia ; so that fortune herself seemed to throw him in pompey's way . 
 there they perished from the inclemency of the season and the severity of their wounds when this success was known , marcus aponius , governor of moesia , was rewarded with a triumphal statue , while fulvius aurelius , julianus titius , and numisius lupus , the legates of the legions , received the ensigns of consular rank otho was delighted , and claimed the glory for himself , as if it were he that commanded success in war , and that had aggrandised the state by his generals and his armies
 at one time the tribunes were factious , at another the consuls had unconstitutional power
 the emperor in his letter on the first of january , after offering the usual prayers for the new year , referred to sabinus , whom he reproached with having corrupted some of his freedmen and having attempted his life , and he claimed vengeance in no obscure language
 would that i had yielded to my young son rather than he to his aged father ! and therefore i pray the more earnestly that the innocent may not pay the penalty of my wickedness
 and the man , whom we dare not offend when he holds only quaestor's rank , are we to see him rise to the dignities of praetor and consul
 tiberius has not incurred such odium blindly this is a studied device to make us believe that there is no reason why the new magistrates should not open the dungeons as well as the temple and the altars
 i should not reckon among the german tribes the cultivators of the tithe-lands , although they are settled on the further side of the rhine and danube
 both were famous soldiers , and by degrees the nearest portions of britain were brought into the condition of a province , and a colony of veterans was also introduced
 i am entering on the history of a period rich in disasters , frightful in its wars , torn by civil strife , and even in peace full of horrors
 but the soldiers of the ninth legion , being over zealous to repair the dishonor which had been sustained , having rashly pursued the fleeing enemy , advanced into disadvantageous ground and went up to the foot of the mountain on which the town ilerda was built . 
to these words caesar thus replied : —that on that very account he felt less hesitation , because he kept in remembrance those circumstances which the helvetian embassadors had mentioned , and that he felt the more indignant at them , in proportion as they had happened undeservedly to the roman people : for if they had been conscious of having done any wrong , it would not have been difficult to be on their guard , but for that very reason had they been deceived , because neither were they aware that any offense had been given by them , on account of which they should be afraid , nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without cause .
vercingetorix led back his men from the part of the hill within the fortifications .
 nay , some virtues are actually hated inflexible strictness , for example , and a temper proof against partiality
 every master should carefully consider the merits of each case , and be slow to grant what once given could not be taken away
 corn being provided , and his soldiers refreshed , and a sufficient time having elapsed since the engagement at dyrrachium , when caesar thought he had sufficiently sounded the disposition of his troops , he thought that he ought to try whether pompey had any intention or inclination to come to a battle . 
 the enemy , urged by their eagerness to capture them , pursued them unguardedly : for instantly the boats of antonius , on a certain signal , rowed with great violence from all parts against the enemy ; and at the first charge took one of the four-banked galleys , with the seamen and marines , and forced the rest to flee disgracefully . 
 as domitius's countenance did not agree with his words , and he did every thing with more confusion and fear than he had shown on the preceding days , and as he had several private meetings with his friends , contrary to his usual practice , in order to take their advice , and as he avoided all public councils and assemblies of the people , the truth could be no longer hid nor dissembled ; for pompey had written back in answer , that he would not put matters to the last hazard ; that domitius had retreated into the town of corfinium without either his advice or consent . 
 but the eagle was saved by atilius verus , the centurion of the first company , who , after making a great slaughter among the enemy , at last fell
at the same time that this message was delivered to caesar , embassadors came from the aedui and the treviri ; from the aedui to complain that the harudes , who had lately been brought over into gaul , were ravaging their territories ; that they had not been able to purchase peace from ariovistus , even by giving hostages : and from the treviri , that a hundred cantons of the suevi had encamped on the banks of the rhine , and were attempting to cross it ; that the brothers , nasuas and cimberius , headed them .
when they could not obtain this , they begged him to send on a dispatch to those who had marched in advance of the main army , and forbid them to engage ; and grant them permission to send embassadors to the ubii , and if the princes and senate of the latter would give them security by oath , they assured caesar that they would accept such conditions as might be proposed by him ; and requested that he would give them the space of three days for negotiating these affairs .
 it is with a vain hope we are aiming to touch nero with shame for his abominations , and we have far more cause to fear that he will vent his fury on your wife , your household , on all others dear to you
 it was built in the consulship of tiberius sempronius and cornelius scipio , when hannibal was threatening italy , as a protection against the gauls from beyond the padus , or against any other sudden invader from the alps
 it is not in the extremity of despair , but while my army yet cries for battle , that i have sacrificed to the state my last chance
 petreius , after accomplishing this , went round every maniple , calling the soldiers by their names , and entreating with tears that they would not give up him and their absent general pompey , as a sacrifice to the vengeance of their enemies . 
 three cohorts with some british cavalry arrived , a force too numerous to elude observation , too small to force its way
 the place selected was an expanse of water , not unlike the sea , where the mouth of the mosa serves to discharge the rhine into the ocean
 on either side they can find troops , horses , tribute
 the degraded populace , frequenters of the arena and the theatre , the most worthless of the slaves , and those who having wasted their property were supported by the infamous excesses of nero , caught eagerly in their dejection at every rumour
 what wonder if i parted with them reluctantly
 to those who could guess the temper of soldiers with some penetration , the strongest symptom of a wide-spread and intractable commotion , was the fact that , instead of being divided or instigated by a few persons , they were unanimous in their fury and equally unanimous in their composure , with so uniform a consistency that one would have thought them to be under command
 as we have mentioned above , vespasian himself had three legions inured to war
 sejanus hung over the emperor , and with knee , face , and hand encountered the falling stones and was found in this attitude by the soldiers who came to their rescue
after giving these instructions he silently dismisses the cavalry in the second watch , where our works were not completed ; he orders all the corn to be brought to himself ; he ordains capital punishment to such as should not obey ; he distributes among them , man by man , the cattle , great quantities of which had been driven there by the mandubii ; he began to measure out the corn sparingly , and by little and little ; he receives into the town all the forces which he had posted in front of it .
 the senators , when they found themselves opposed , relinquished the liberty which they had begun to exercise
 slaves perform the rite , who are instantly swallowed up by its waters
 so blinded and perverted was his mind by incessant flattery , that he did not know that it was only a bad emperor whom a good father would make his heir
 they aim chiefly at a harsh note and a confused roar , putting their shields to their mouth , so that , by reverberation , it may swell into a fuller and deeper sound
 at the same time he highly extolled sejanus on the ground that it was through his exertions and vigilance that such fury of the flames had been confined to the destruction of a single building
 part of the army was on its way to germany
 but the emperor , who perceived the political aims of her request , but did not wish to show displeasure or apprehension , left her , notwithstanding her urgency , without an answer
 cneius pompeius was the first of our countrymen to subdue the jews
 overcome by these arguments , the emperor preferred domitius to his own son , though he was but two years older , and made a speech in the senate , the same in substance as the representations of his freedman
 subsequently they were driven back by missiles and arrows , and having in vain attempted for peace , some took refuge with germanicus , while the rest leaving their cantons and villages dispersed themselves in their forests
after fighting from noon almost to sunset , without victory inclining in favor of either , the germans , on one side , made a charge against the enemy in a compact body , and drove them back ; and , when they were put to flight , the archers were surrounded and cut to pieces .
 she declared , in answer , that she too had decided to die , and claimed for herself the blow of the executioner
 the same night brought with it a cheering dream to germanicus he saw himself engaged in sacrifice , and his robe being sprinkled with the sacred blood , another more beautiful was given him by the hands of his grandmother augusta
 the war would have been finished that day , if the fleet had hastened to come up
 but some wives have abandoned themselves to scheming and rapacity
 the following year inflicted a terrible blow on his affections and his fortunes otho's fleet , while cruising idly about , cruelly ravaged intemelii , a district of liguria
 and so now i have resolved to throw off the yoke of my labours at the bar , and for trains of followers on my way to and from the court and for crowded receptions i crave no more than for the bronzes and busts which have invaded my house even against my will
 to this accordingly he gave his mind , and sent publius vitellius and caius antius to collect the taxes of gaul
 this made a deep impression on the mind of tiberius
 i shall be added to the number of the numisii and herennii , so that all your commanders will have fallen by the hands of their soldiers or of the enemy
 it is , he said , the stubbornness of inferiors which lessens the clemency of our ruler
 i shall have that of my darling tiberius
the island is triangular in its form , and one of its sides is opposite to gaul .
 many were left behind half dead , some even unwounded , in the hurry of victory
 kalenus , having put the legions and cavalry on board at brundusium , as caesar had directed him , as far as the number of his ships allowed , weighed anchor : and having sailed a little distance from port , received a letter from caesar , in which he was informed , that all the ports and the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet : on receiving this information he returned into the harbor , and recalled all the vessels . 
but when they saw that it was being moved , and was approaching their walls , startled by the new and unaccustomed sight , they sent embassadors to caesar about peace ; who spoke in the following manner : that they did not believe the romans waged war without divine aid , since they were able to move forward machines of such a height with so great speed , and thus fight from close quarters ; that they resigned themselves and all their possessions to disposal : that they begged and earnestly entreated one thing , viz .
 it concerns the interests of the commonwealth , it concerns the honour due to vespasian , that he should be met by those whom the senate counts to be peculiarly blameless , and who may fill the emperor's ear with honourable counsels
 the bridge which had been broken down by the storm was almost repaired , and he ordered it to be finished in the night . 
 one of otho's freedmen , on being questioned as to the cause of his departure , replied that he was entrusted with his master's last commands otho was still alive , he said , when he left him , but his only thoughts were for posterity , and he had torn himself from all the fascinations of life they were struck with admiration , and were ashamed to put any more questions , and then the hearts of all turned to vitellius
 matters , he said , have not yet gone so far as to require the extremity of war
 at the same time the other legions , influenced by the contagion of example , and by their dislike of the german troops , were meditating war
 he , they declared , was the instigator of the crime , gallus his tool at last , utterly terrified by their threats of instant death , the legate himself charged hordeonius with treachery
 on the shore stood the opposing army with its dense array of armed warriors , while between the ranks dashed women , in black attire like the furies , with hair dishevelled , waving brands
 still better is the condition of those states in which only maidens are given in marriage , and where the hopes and expectations of a bride are then finally terminated
by these very men , , are our plans and whatever is done in the camp , disclosed to the enemy ; that they could not be restrained by him : nay more , he was well aware , that though compelled by necessity , he had disclosed the matter to caesar , at how great a risk he had done it ; and for that reason , he had been silent as long as he could .
 if cerialis wishes for the empire of gaul , we can be content with the boundaries of our own states
 they live scattered and apart , just as a spring , a meadow , or a wood has attracted them
 they , therefore , sent deputies to caesar , and begged a supply from him ; all other inconveniences they bore by their own resources , as well as they could : and after a long interval , when the length of the siege had made octavius's troops more remiss than usual , having got an opportunity at noon , when the enemy were dispersed , they disposed their wives and children on the walls , to keep up the appearance of their usual attention ; and forming themselves into one body , with the slaves whom they had lately enfranchised , they made an attack on octavius's nearest camp , and having forced that , attacked the second with the same fury ; and then the third and the fourth , and then the other , and beat them from them all : and having killed a great number , obliged the rest and octavius himself to fly for refuge to their ships . 
 some said that dutiful feeling towards a father , and the necessities of the state in which laws had then no place , drove him into civil war , which can neither be planned nor conducted on any right principles
besides , by secret messages and embassies , he tampers with the allobroges , whose minds , he hopes , had not yet settled down after the excitement of the late war .
 of these senecio , one of those who was specially intimate with nero , still kept up a show of friendship , and had consequently to struggle with all the more dangers
 titus ampius flavianus was the governor of pannonia , poppaeus silvanus of dalmatia
the helvii , voluntarily engaging in battle with their neighbors , are defeated , and caius valerius donotaurus , the son of caburus , the principal man of the state , and several others , being slain , they are forced to retire within their towns and fortifications .
 from adrumetum , where he had stayed to watch the result , festus went to the legion , and gave orders that cetronius pisanus , prefect of the camp , should be put in irons he did this out of private pique , but he called the man an accomplice of piso some few centurions and soldiers he punished , others he rewarded , neither the one nor the other deservedly , but he wished men to believe that he had extinguished a war
 if they attempted anything more , on their side would be the wrong and the guilt , with the romans the vengeance of heaven
 ten ases a day is the value set on life and limb
 the senators , however , whose only fear was lest they might seem to understand him , burst into complaints , tears , and prayers
 the state was the standard of everything when it was poor , the homes of the citizens were humble
 neither wife nor son are dearer to me than my father and the state but he will surely have the protection of his own majesty , the empire of rome that of our other armies
 such enthusiasm confounded the roman general
 her first marriage , by which she had children , was with tiberius nero , who , an exile during the perusian war , returned to rome when peace had been concluded between sextus pompeius and the triumvirs
 the britons with equal steadiness and skill used their huge swords and small shields to avoid or to parry the missiles of our soldiers , while they themselves poured on us a dense shower of darts , till agricola encouraged three batavian and two tungrian cohorts to bring matters to the decision of close fighting with swords
 when servilius , the consul , and the other magistrates opposed him , and he himself effected less than he expected , in order to raise the passions of the people , he dropped it , and promulgated two others ; one , by which he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the tenants , the other , an act of insolvency : upon which the mob made an assault on caius trebonius , and having wounded several persons , drove him from his tribunal . 
 at their prayer , blaesus and lucius apronius , a roman knight on drusus's staff , with justus catonius , a first-rank centurion , were again sent to tiberius
in other parts , likewise , our men pursued to the camp the retreating enemy , and did not give them an opportunity of rallying .
 they have , besides , the balsam-tree and the palm
 then , indeed , the open plain presented an awful and hideous spectacle
 the example of not contending more than once shall belong to me
on hearing these things , because they were of opinion that the legions were passing in three different places , and that the entire army , being terrified by the revolt of the aedui , were preparing for flight , they divided their forces also into three divisions .
caesar orders the horse to give way purposely , and retreat to the camp : at the same time he orders the camp to be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions , the gates to be barricaded , and in executing these things as much confusion to be shown as possible , and to perform them under the pretense of fear .
 caesar conducted matters as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not yet to be given up . 
 the britons , however , exhibit more spirit , as being a people whom a long peace has not yet enervated
 the youth himself was of distinguished beauty , a skilful horseman and swordsman both after our fashion and that of his country
 about 10 , 000 of the enemy were slain
 there is seldom safety for the unfortunate , and caractacus , seeking the protection of cartismandua , queen of the brigantes , was put in chains and delivered up to the conquerors , nine years after the beginning of the war in britain
 cneius pompeius was then for the third time elected consul to reform public morals , but in applying remedies more terrible than the evils and repealing the legislation of which he had himself been the author , he lost by arms what by arms he had been maintaining
 but the first opportunity of unmasking his savage wrath was furnished by fortunatus , a freedman , who having embezzled his patron's property , deserted him to become his accuser he had as his accomplice claudius demianus , whom vetus , when proconsul of asia , had imprisoned for his gross misdeeds , and whom nero now released as a recompense for the accusation
 all who were present were terrified at their death , and , with the ignorant populace , which ever blindly shares in the fears of others , took the oath of allegiance to vitellius
 timotheus , questioning persons who had found their way to pontus , learnt that there was there a city sinope , and near it a temple , which , according to an old tradition of the neighbourhood , was sacred to the infernal jupiter , for there also stood close at hand a female figure , to which many gave the name of proserpine
 caesar , meanwhile , after dedicating the temples in campania , warned the public by an edict not to disturb his retirement and posted soldiers here and there to keep off the throngs of townsfolk but he so loathed the towns and colonies and , in short , every place on the mainland , that he buried himself in the island of capreae which is separated by three miles of strait from the extreme point of the promontory of sorrentum
in the mean time , whilst these things are going on , the forces of the enemy from the arverni , and the cavalry which had been demanded from all gaul , meet together .
 without pausing in her winter voyage agrippina arrived at the island of corcyra , facing the shores of calabria
 for now the legions in battle array were advancing , and the rabble of townsfolk who knew nothing of war had their faculties of sight and hearing quite paralysed
 upon this the emperor , after repeating his invectives against his grandson and his daughter-in-law and reprimanding the populace in an edict complained to the senate that by the trick of one senator the imperial dignity had been publicly flouted , and he insisted that , after all , the whole matter should be left to his exclusive decision
 nothing was left but to adopt the last resource , namely , to possess himself of as many hills as he could , and cover as great an extent of country as possible with his troops , and divide caesar's forces as much as possible ; and so it happened : for having raised twenty-four forts , and taken in a compass of fifteen miles , he got forage in this space , and within this circuit there were several fields lately sown , in which the cattle might feed in the mean time . 
 the iberians from their knowledge of the country fought at an advantage
 this indeed had really occurred through the filial affection of servilia that was the girl's name , who , out of love for her father and the thoughtlessness of youth , had consulted them , only however about the safety of her family , whether nero could be appeased , and the trial before the senate have no dreadful result
it is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide deserts as possible around them , their frontiers having been laid waste .
but the triviri and indutiomarus let no part of the entire winter pass without sending embassadors across the rhine , importuning the states , promising money , and asserting that , as a large portion of our army had been cut off , a much smaller portion remained .
 lepida tried to win the young prince's heart by flattery and lavish liberality , while agrippina on the other hand , who could give her son empire but could not endure that he should be emperor , was fierce and full of menace
 meanwhile otho , to the surprise of all , was not sinking down into luxury and sloth
 certainly , he said , nero did not compel this act
 gaul is roused at the name of the great dictator , and i distrust no less the nations of asia , because of the renown of such a grandfather as drusus
 for he also exhibited secular games , at which indeed , being one of the priesthood of the fifteen and praetor at the time , i specially assisted
 then followed much talk about augustus himself , and many expressed an idle wonder that the same day marked the beginning of his assumption of empire and the close of his life , and , again , that he had ended his days at nola in the same house and room as his father octavius
 the legions however were not marched by the nearest route , for should they cross the river avaxes which washes the city's walls by a bridge , they would be within missile-range
 their quarrels and their harmony are alike ruinous to their subjects
 and titus caesar , seeing that the position forbad an assault or any of the more rapid operations of war , determined to proceed by earthworks and covered approaches
 caesar on crossing the visurgis learnt by the information of a deserter that arminius had chosen a battle-field , that other tribes too had assembled in a forest sacred to hercules , and would venture on a night attack on his camp
 he also distributed among the youth arms which he had had secretly manufactured
 some there were among the generals who were contriving delays , for antonius in fact was now becoming too great a man , and their hopes from mucianus were more definite
 each man's comrades gathered round him from words they came to blows , and a fierce battle would have broken out , had not two praetorian cohorts taken the side of the 14th , and given confidence to them , while they intimidated the batavians
 this roused the anxieties of the capital
 the greeks welcomed him with the most elaborate honours , and brought forward all the old deeds and sayings of their countrymen , to give additional dignity to their flattery
 as for the men before him , they had been mithridates's allies against sulla , allies of antonius against the divine augustus
 this loss , like many of the evils of war , was forgotten in the greater disasters which happened to other cities
 they plundered and then fired the camp , and all who survived the battle the flames destroyed
 shortly afterwards , the information of the same men proved fatal to subrius flavus at first he grounded his defence on his moral contrast to the others , implying that an armed soldier , like himself , would never have shared such an attempt with unarmed and effeminate associates
since indutiomarus was daily advancing up to the camp with greater defiance , all the cavalry of the neighboring states which he had taken care to have sent for , having been admitted in one night , he confined all his men within the camp by guards with such great strictness , that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to the treviri .
 as they passed colony after colony , the populace in black , the knights in their state robes , burnt vestments and perfumes with other usual funeral adjuncts , in proportion to the wealth of the place
 this guilt , he said , is shared by all
that canton was called the tigurine ; for the whole helvetian state is divided into four cantons .
 he completed thirty-seven years of life , twelve years of power , and he is still a theme of song among barbarous nations , though to greek historians , who admire only their own achievements , he is unknown , and to romans not as famous as he should be , while we extol the past and are indifferent to our own times
 piso delivered a graceful oration and was supported by the feeling of the senate
 it was not an equitable proposal , to require that caesar should quit ariminum and return to his province ; but that he pompey should himself retain his province and the legions that belonged to another , and desire that caesar's army should be disbanded , while he himself was making new levies : and that he should merely promise to go to his province , without naming the day on which he would set out ; so that if he should not set out till after caesar's consulate expired , yet he would not appear bound by any religious scruples about asserting a falsehood . 
 the emperor on hearing of the death of his representative appointed aulus didius in his place , that the province might not be left without a governor
 he has wealth and eloquence , which might make him superior to many , were he not oppressed by the consciousness of guilt
 meantime envoys arrived from artabanus , king of the parthians
 some have said that he was imprisoned and soon released , his property having been taken from him as a substitute for the royal treasure
 the perfidy of the armenians was notorious , and he had nothing to fall back on but a fortress without stores
 many successes have fallen to the lot of rome , some to that of parthia , as a warning against pride
 but i pass to the latin orators among them , it is not , i imagine , menenius agrippa , who may seem ancient , whom you usually prefer to the speakers of our day , but cicero , caelius , calvus , brutus , asinius , messala
 he actually received his first dose of poison from his tutors and passed it off his bowels , as it was rather weak or so qualified as not at once to prove deadly
 immediately afterwards it became known that spain had gone over to vitellius
 but as suetonius was far away , they implored aid from the procurator , catus decianus
this circumstance turns aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting to draw his sword : the enemy crowd around him when embarrassed .
 as soon as he knew their inclinations , he made his escape privately . 
 of this they are impatient
 after this speech from mucianus , the other officers crowded round vespasian with fresh confidence , encouraging him , and reminding him of the responses of prophets and the movements of the heavenly bodies
 they are now enemies , because their yoke is easy
 i may add that when scipio was called on for his opinion , he replied , as i think what all men think about the deeds of poppaea , suppose me to say what all men say a graceful compromise this between the affection of the husband and the necessities of the senator
 he ordered the throng which stood near him , as it seemed a promiscuous gathering , to separate itself into its military companies
 they add something further to strengthen the impression that they intended to treat about an accommodation . 
accordingly , the volcae tectosages , seized on those parts of germany which are the most fruitful around the hercynian forest , , and settled there which nation to this time retains its position in those settlements , and has a very high character for justice and military merit ; now also they continue in the same scarcity , indigence , hardihood , as the germans , and use the same food and dress ; but their proximity to the province and knowledge of commodities from countries beyond the sea supplies to the gauls many things tending to luxury as well as civilization .
 besides , i would advise priscus not to climb higher than the throne , or to impose his counsels on vespasian , an old man , who has won the honours of a triumph , and has two sons grown to manhood
 tiberius nero and claudius drusus , his stepsons , he honoured with imperial tides , although his own family was as yet undiminished
 when these circumstances were announced to afranius , he left the work which he had begun , and returned to his camp , determined as it appeared , whatever should be the event , to bear it with an even and steady mind . 
 but he could not repeat the blow , as he was hurried onwards by his horse , and the wounded man was protected by the bravest of his guards
 it was however in public that most alarm was felt with every piece of intelligence that rumour brought , men changed their looks and spirits , anxious not to appear discouraged by unfavourable omens , or too little delighted by success
 then , for the first time , we won the friendship of the moschi , a nation which became pre-eminently attached to rome , and they overran the wilds of armenia
 one of his eyes had been destroyed he was repulsive in countenance and even more feeble in intellect the guilt of the troops seemed to be doubled , when the other legion , deserting the camp at bonna , joined their ranks
 the men in mail were somewhat of an obstacle , as the iron plates did not yield to javelins or swords
 without further deliberation , they proceeded , not indeed to pronounce the final sentence for this was forbidden , but to declare that they were prepared for vengeance , and were restrained only by the strong hand of the sovereign
the ships having been drawn up and a general assembly of the gauls held at samarobriva , because the corn that year had not prospered in gaul by reason of the droughts , he was compelled to station his army in its winter-quarters differently from the former years , and to distribute the legions among several states : one of them he gave to gaius fabius , his legate , to be marched into the territories of the morini ; a second to quintus cicero , into those of the nervii ; a third to lucius roscius , into those of the esubii ; a fourth he ordered to winter with titus labienus among the remi in the confines of the treveri ; he stationed three in belgium ; over these he appointed marcus crassus , his quaestor , and lucius munatius plancus and gaius trebonius , his legates .
 a cenotaph was raised at antioch , where the body was burnt , a lofty mound at epidaphna , where he had ended his life
 the lust of rule was more to him than his brother and his daughter , and his heart was steeled to any wickedness
caesar , after he discovered through the ubian scouts that the suevi had retired into their woods , apprehending a scarcity of corn , because , as we have observed above , all the germans pay very little attention to agriculture , resolved not to proceed any further ; but , that he might not altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his return , and that he might delay their succors , having led back his army , he breaks down , to the length of 200 feet , the further end of the bridge , which joined the banks of the ubii , and at the extremity of the bridge raises towers of four stories , and stations a guard of twelve cohorts for the purpose of defending the bridge , and strengthens the place with considerable fortifications .
 their religious belief may be traced in the strongly-marked british superstition
 on hearing of the mutiny in the legions , he instantly went to the spot , and met them outside the camp , eyes fixed on the ground , and seemingly repentant
 kings' sons were given as hostages , in order that when parthia was tired of home rule , it might fall back on the emperor and the senate , and receive from them a better sovereign , familiar with roman habits
 such was the state of britain , and such were the vicissitudes of the war , which agricola found on his crossing over about midsummer
 death , which nature ordains for all alike , yet admits of the distinction of being either forgotten , or remembered with honour by posterity
 next he ordered the destruction of marcus annaeus lucanus as the blood flowed freely from him , and he felt a chill creeping through his feet and hands , and the life gradually ebbing from his extremities , though the heart was still warm and he retained his mental power , lucanus recalled some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded soldier dying a similar kind of death , and he recited the very lines these were his last words
 still , personally , he said , he felt towards him his father's resentment in all its force , and the return of silanus had not cancelled the intentions of augustus
 there at their leisure for in the entertainment , ignorant as they were , they found no amusement they asked questions about the crowd on the benches , about the distinctions of classes , who were the knights , where was the senate , till they observed some persons in a foreign dress on the seats of the senators
 besides , many spoils were produced ; the men and horses that were taken were brought into their sight , that they might imagine that every moment of time which intervened was a delay to their conquest . 
while he was considering these things an opportunity of acting successfully seemed to offer .
 in dealing with the jews , who had been daring enough to slay our soldiers , there was little hesitation about their being capitally punished
 there was asia minor
 his excuse was that a similar decree had been made for himself and his brother at the request of augustus
 from all quarters arrived the most alarming tidings
 it was not to defend italy that we occupied the borders of the rhine , but to insure that no second ariovistus should seize the empire of gaul
 shame therefore quite as much as hope of reward prompted men not to take the place of a pitiful client rather than that of a patron , or to see hereditary connections transferred to others , or to seem spiritless and incapable of office from either failing to obtain it or from holding it weakly when obtained
 civilis , who was resolved on rebellion , and intended , while concealing his ulterior designs , to reveal his other plans as occasion presented itself , set about the work of revolution in this way
 accordingly neither the treveri , the lingones , nor the other revolted states , took measures at all proportioned to the magnitude of the peril they had incurred
 believing that friendship may be retained by munificent gifts rather than by consistency of character , he deserved more of it than he secured
 when caesar perceived that afranius declined coming to an engagement , he resolved to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile's distance from the very foot of the mountain ; and that his soldiers while engaged in their works , might not be terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy , or disturbed in their work , he ordered them not to fortify it with a wall , which must rise high , and be seen at a distance , but draw , on the front opposite the enemy , a trench fifteen feet broad . 
dismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode of battle , our men did not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which they had been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground .
 those who come over to their religion adopt the practice , and have this lesson first instilled into them , to despise all gods , to disown their country , and set at nought parents , children , and brethren
 the throne was offered him by men who did not know him
 the frisian name thus became famous in germany , and tiberius kept our losses a secret , not wishing to entrust any one with the war
 the forum yet streamed with blood , when he was borne in a litter over heaps of dead to the capitol , and thence to the palace he suffered the bodies to be given up for burial , and to be burnt
 certainly if a subordinate oversteps the bounds of duty and of obedience to his commander , and has exulted in his death and in my affliction , i shall hate him and exclude him from my house , and i shall avenge a personal quarrel without resorting to my power as emperor
 the very first view of their situation paralyzed them they saw opposed to them what seemed a hostile array , threatening them with javelin and sword
 after satisfying himself that his friends had set out , he passed a tranquil night , and it is even said that he slept
 cassius chaerea , who won for himself a memory with posterity by the murder of caius caesar , being then a youth of high spirit , cleared a passage with his sword through the armed and opposing throng
 with no less precipitation , narcissus , claudius's freedman , whose quarrels with agrippina i have mentioned , was driven to suicide by his cruel imprisonment and hopeless plight , even against the wishes of nero , with whose yet concealed vices he was wonderfully in sympathy from his rapacity and extravagance
 their envoys , who had assumed a studied appearance of misery and distress , passed through the headquarters and the men's tents , and complaining , now of their own wrongs , now of the rewards bestowed on the neighbouring states , and , when they found the soldiers' ears open to their words , of the perils and insults to which the army itself was exposed , inflamed the passions of the troops
 then he eagerly watched his opportunity , and , as the emperor lingered long at ostia , he sought two of the mistresses to whose society claudius was especially partial , and , by gifts , by promises , by dwelling on power increased by the wife's fall , he induced them to undertake the work of the informer
 again , that book of marcus cicero , in which he lauded cato to the skies , how else was it answered by caesar the dictator , than by a written oration in reply , as if he was pleading in court
 again , the hides were covered over with mattresses , that they might not be destroyed by fire or stones . 
 yet they count this greater happiness than groaning over field-labour , toiling at building , and poising the fortunes of themselves and others between hope and fear
 this is not my first day of steadfast loyalty towards the roman people from the time that the divine augustus gave me the citizenship , i have chosen my friends and foes with an eye to your advantage , not from hatred of my fatherland for traitors are detested even by those whom they prefer but because i held that romans and germans have the same interests , and that peace is better than war
 it seemed that a thousand vessels were required , and they were speedily constructed , some of small draught with a narrow stem and stern and a broad centre , that they might bear the waves more easily
 after the battle had in this manner continued incessantly for five hours , and our men had suffered much from superior numbers , having spent all their javelins , they drew their swords and charged the enemy up the hill , and , having killed a few , obliged the rest to fly . 
 only , he said , stand in battle array , and the soldiers will not fight when they see that piso whom they themselves once called 'father , ' is the stronger , if right is to decide if arms , is far from powerless he then deployed his companies before the lines of the fortress on a high and precipitous hill , with the sea surrounding him on every other side
 round the funeral bier were ranged the images of the claudii and the julii
 beginning first with himself and his dependants , he kept his household under restraint , a thing as hard to many as ruling a province
 in this work , and the deliberations on it , two days were spent . 
 they had in their own country a river cenchrius , a grove ortygia , where latona , as she leaned in the pangs of labour on an olive still standing , gave birth to those two deities , whereupon the grove at the divine intimation was consecrated there apollo himself , after the slaughter of the cyclops , shunned the wrath of jupiter
 he ordered cotys to be murdered and falsely represented his death as self-inflicted
 vitellius , however , when his brother joined him , and when those who are skilled in the arts of despotism began to creep into his confidence , grew more arrogant and cruel he ordered the execution of dolabella , whose banishment by otho to the colonia aquinas i have before mentioned
 their desperate plight , and the extreme terror that paralyses them , have rivetted their line to this spot , that you might achieve in it a splendid and memorable victory
 and then , by marrying him and making him emperor , again seize the control of the state
 the emperor accordingly sent the senate a speech in which he argued that both ought to be removed from the state , and made it a reproach against cassius that among his ancestors' busts he had specially revered that of caius cassius , which bore the inscription to the party-leader
 at a certain season of the year the lake throws up bitumen , and the method of collecting it has been taught by that experience which teaches all other arts
 elsewhere the inferiority of the freedman marks the freedom of the state
that request having been obtained , they all threw themselves in tears at caesar's feet , that they no less begged and earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed , than that they might obtain those things which they wished for ; inasmuch as they saw , that , if a disclosure was made , they should be put to the greatest tortures .
 throughout the conspiracy nothing , it was certain , fell with more terror on the ears of nero , who was as unused to be told of the crimes he perpetrated as he was eager in their perpetration
 he was one who screened himself , while he was attacking others
 wishing to attract popular sympathy , he did not even cast off his miserable garb
 public acknowledgments and thanks were also given to the armies of germany , and envoys were sent charged with congratulations
 piso was then put in a litter and attended by a tribune of one of the praetorian cohorts , who followed him , so it was variously rumoured , to guard his person or to be his executioner
in that council he declares cingetorix , the leader of the other faction , his own son-in-law an enemy and confiscates his property .
 while he was haranguing his troops marvellous to relate such a multitude of ill-omened birds flew over him , as to obscure with a dark cloud the light of day
over that legion and camp he places q tullius cicero and gives him 200 horse .
 the rest of the praetorian cohorts were entrusted to lucius vitellius , brother of the emperor , for the defence of the capital
 him he encouraged and animated by promises both in his own and the king's name , and instructed him both by letters and messages how he should act . 
 the betasii and nervii , also capitulating , were incorporated by civilis into his army he now commanded vast resources , as the states were either completely cowed , or else were naturally inclined in his favour
toward evening caesar ordered the gates to be shut , and the soldiers to go out of the town , lest the towns-people should receive any injury from them by night .
caesar sends back fabius with his legion to his winter-quarters ; he himself determines to winter with three legions near samarobriva in three different quarters , and , because such great commotions had arisen in gaul , he resolved to remain during the whole winter with the army himself .
 montanus was spared to his father's intercessions on the understanding that he was not to be admitted to political life
 inter quae veris principio legati parthorum mandata regis vologaesis litterasque in eandem formam attulere 
 by his sudden arrival , he fell in with some of our transports , and set them on fire , and carried off one laden with corn ; he struck great terror into our men , and having in the night landed a party of soldiers and archers , he beat our guard of horse from their station , and gained so much by the advantage of situation , that he dispatched letters to pompey , and if he pleased he might order the rest of the ships to be hauled upon shore and repaired ; for that with his own fleet he could prevent caesar from receiving his auxiliaries . 
is by chance stuck in a tower , and , not being observed by our men for two days , was seen by a certain soldier on the third day : when taken down , it was carried to cicero .
 gallus was then bringing up the first legion to the relief of placentia he hardly dared trust so few cohorts , fearing that they could not sustain a prolonged siege or the formidable attack of the german army
 then by degrees the instinct of obedience returned
the helvetii , either because they thought that the romans , struck with terror , were retreating from them , the more so , as the day before , though they had seized on the higher grounds , they had not joined battle or because they flattered themselves that they might be cut of from the provisions , altering their plan and changing their route , began to pursue , and to annoy our men in the rear .
 she had no subsequent issue , but allied as she was through the marriage of agrippina and germanicus to the blood of augustus , her great-grandchildren were also his
 and unless masters , slaves , and estates have the resources of the provinces as their mainstay , our shrubberies , forsooth , and our country houses will have to support us
 let segestes dwell on the conquered bank
 the seven remaining cohorts he had disposed to protect his camp , and the neighboring forts . 
 afterwards the car , the vestments , and , if you like to believe it , the divinity herself , are purified in a secret lake
 already at ostia , where he had arrived , he was the centre of interest to a vast concourse as well as to secret gatherings in the capital , while tiberius was distracted by the doubt whether he should crush this slave of his by military force or allow time to dissipate a silly credulity
 at dawn of day , before either side commenced hostilities , sabinus sent cornelius martialis , a centurion of the first rank , to vitellius , with instructions to complain of the infraction of the stipulated terms
 instructions were also given to amulius serenus and quintius sabinus , centurions of the first rank , to bring up the german soldiers from the hall of liberty
 half of the fine is paid to the king or to the state , half to the person whose wrongs are avenged and to his relatives
 all this was done by the impulsive action of the soldiers without the preliminary of a formal harangue or any concentration of the legions
 as to lepida , the emperor was to decide cassius was transported to the island of sardinia , and he was quietly left to old age
 these and several other arguments to the same effect were delivered , as they were a people of great learning , with great pathos and lamentations . 
 are we sorry that the balbi came to us from spain , and other men not less illustrious from narbon gaul
 he began to speak of the soldiers' discharge after sixteen years , of the rewards of completed service , of the daily pay being a denarius , and of the veterans not being detained under a standard
 fodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed his horses upon leaves stripped off the trees , or the tender roots of reeds pounded for the corn which had been sown within the lines was already consumed , and they would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder from corcyra and acarnania , over a long tract of sea ; and as the quantity of that fell short , to increase it by mixing barley with it , and by these methods support their cavalry . 
 still there was a marvellous rivalry among the nobles in decreeing thanksgivings at all the shrines , and the celebration with annual games of minerva's festival , as the day on which the plot had been discovered also , that a golden image of minerva with a statue of the emperor by its side should be set up in the senate-house , and that agrippina's birthday should be classed among the inauspicious days
 pompey arrived in thessaly a few days after , and having harangued the combined army , returned thanks to his own men , and exhorted scipio's soldiers , that as the victory was now secured , they should endeavor to merit a part of the rewards and booty . 
and there was formerly a time when the gauls excelled the germans in prowess , and waged war on them offensively , and , on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land , sent colonies over the rhine .
having thus consoled his soldiers , he leads them back on the same day to the camp , and determined to prepare the other things which were necessary for the siege of the town .
 he himself disposed slingers in convenient places to cover our men in their retreat . 
while the enemy were encumbered by reason of the burdens which they were carrying , he orders a sally to be made suddenly from two gates .
they worship as their divinity , mercury in particular , and have many images of him , and regard him as the inventor of all arts , they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches , and believe him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions .
 these reverses , which , though trifling , came in rapid succession , destroyed by degrees the prestige of the recent victory
 day and night they kept up a thunder of applause , and applied to the emperor's person and voice the epithets of deities
 satis adprobatam vim
 there was no addition to the price , although about two hundred ships were destroyed in the very harbour by a violent storm , and one hundred more , which had sailed up the tiber , by an accidental fire
 men , as they carried off for themselves coin or temple-offerings of massive gold , were cut down by others of superior strength
 while they both disdained trebellius , they raised him above themselves
 the war-song of the men , and the shrill cries of the women , rose from the whole line , and an answering but far less vigorous cheer , came from the legions and auxiliaries
they do all this with a view to recover their soldiers ; but being contaminated by guilt , and charmed by the gains arising from the plundered property , as that act was shared in by many , and being tempted by the fear of punishment , they began to form plans of war and stir up the other states by embassies .
 then , at the emperor's suggestion , they decreed that no one was to propose to any council of our allies that a vote of thanks ought to be given in the senate to propraetors or proconsuls , and that no one was to discharge such a mission
 mucianus entered the camp to examine more accurately the individual claims
 the same intelligence was brought to curio ; but for some time he could not give credit to it , because he had so great confidence in his own good fortune . 
 scipio , afranius , this very cassius , this same brutus , he nowhere describes as brigands and traitors , terms now applied to them , but repeatedly as illustrious men
 silius meantime was advancing with two legions , and having sent forward some auxiliary troops was ravaging those villages of the sequani , which , situated on the border , adjoin the aedui , and were associated with them in arms
 curio , as his idea of their present behavior was calculated to confirm his former hopes , imagined that the enemy were running away , and led his army from the rising grounds down to the plain . 
 for myself , senators , i am mortal and limited to the functions of humanity , content if i can adequately fill the highest place
having then held an interview with viridomarus and eporedirix the aeduans , he learns that litavicus had set out with all the cavalry to raise the aedui ; that it was necessary that they too should go before him to confirm the state in their allegiance .
 the quantity was very small , both from the nature of the land for the country is rough and mountainous , and the people commonly import what grain they use ; and because pompey had foreseen what would happen , and some days before had plundered the parthini , and having ravaged and dug up their houses , carried off all the corn , which he collected by means of his horse . 
 but the nearer germanicus was to the highest hope , the more laboriously did he exert himself for tiberius , and he made the neighbouring sequani and all the belgic states swear obedience to him
 caesar , imagining that the war would be protracted to too great a length , and despairing of his convoys from italy , because all the coasts were guarded with great diligence by pompey's adherents ; and because his own fleets , which he had built during the winter , in sicily , gaul , and italy , were detained ; sent lucius canuleius into epirus to procure corn ; and because these countries were too remote , he fixed granaries in certain places , and regulated the carriage of the corn for the neighboring states . 
 claudius then summoned all his most powerful friends first he questioned turranius , superintendent of the corn market next , lusius geta , who commanded the praetorians
 this did not last long , as the lot strayed away to unfit persons
 novius priscus , as seneca's friend , glitius gallus , and annius pollio , as men disgraced rather than convicted , escaped with sentences of banishment
 such an alarm was spread through gaul , that as the army advanced , whole states , headed by their magistrates and with prayers on their lips , came forth to meet it , while the women and children lay prostrate along the roads , and all else that might appease an enemy's fury was offered , though war there was none , to secure the boon of peace
 he was liberal in his promises and even extravagant , as men in their alarm naturally are
 at last valens began to suspect that insolence would end in actual treachery
 one of them carried two hundred and twenty recruits , the other was manned with somewhat less than two hundred veterans . 
for if he should summon the legions into the province , he was aware that on their march they would have to fight in his absence ; he foresaw too that if he himself should endeavor to reach the army , he would act injudiciously , in trusting his safety even to those who seemed to be tranquilized .
caesar , though he discerned from what motive these things were said , and what circumstances deterred him from his meditated plan , still , in order that he might not be compelled to waste the summer among the treveri , while all things were prepared for the war with britain , ordered indutiomarus to come to him with 200 hostages .
 her funeral was simple , and her will long remained unexecuted
 these were at once overthrown antonius pursued those that fled , and crushed those that encountered him then came the rest of his troops , who , as they were severally disposed , plundered , made prisoners , or seized on weapons and horses
one thing stood in the way of all this-that he had learned by experience his brother diviciacus's very high regard for the roman people , his great affection toward him , his distinguished faithfulness , justice , and moderation ; for he was afraid lest by the punishment of this man , he should hurt the feelings of diviciacus .
 the captains of the triremes rushed with a great outcry on the images of vitellius
 germanicus himself put four legions on shipboard and conveyed them through the lakes , and the infantry , cavalry , and fleet met simultaneously at the river already mentioned
 their territory was ravaged , spoil taken everywhere without the enemy venturing on an engagement , or if they attempted to harass our march by stealthy attacks , their cunning was always punished
 grief and sorrow but slowly it is thought becoming for women to bewail , for men to remember , the dead
 it is said that laco , without galba's knowledge , meditated the death of vinius , either hoping by this execution to appease the fury of the soldiers , or believing him to be an accomplice of otho , or , it may be , out of mere hatred
 there was no want of deference on the part of the senate
 parts of armenia , according to their respective proximities , were put under the subjection of pharasmanes , polemo , aristobulus , and antiochus
 the soldiers' part too in the conspiracy no longer escaped discovery , some in their rage becoming informers to betray faenius rufus , whom they could not endure to be both an accomplice and a judge
 set before them my six children sympathy will be on the side of the accusers , and to those who screen themselves under infamous orders belief or pardon will be refused
 in nero's fourth consulship with cornelius cossus for his colleague , a theatrical entertainment to be repeated every five years was established at rome in imitation of the greek festival
 there were the excesses of quintus tedius and vedius pollio
 the trenches were heaped up with corpses nor was it only from the deadly blows of the enemy that they suffered
 as soon as he entered the entrenchments , they secured the gates with sentries , and ordered bodies of armed men to be in readiness at certain points of the camp
 her conversation was charming and her wit anything but dull
 they had actually dragged piso's statues to the gemonian stairs , and were breaking them in pieces , when by the emperor's order they were rescued and replaced
 the result was , that , while they extolled the spirit of valentinus , they followed the counsels of auspex
 but of these , the ship on board of which he was , persevered itself , and continuing its flight , and by the aid of the wind got out of sight : the other two , affrighted by the approach of our galleys put back again into the harbor . 
although the army of the enemy was routed on the left wing and put to flight , they pressed heavily on our men from the right wing , by the great number of their troops .
 he desired the other legions , which were passing the winter at a great distance , to follow close after him . 
 vitellianists , they pretended , might be thus concealed
 it was a matter of common talk how he had repeatedly displayed himself to the soldiers on the road during the march
 even this did not abate curio's hopes . 
 upon this , they sounded those whom they thought best for their purpose , and when they saw that a majority of their legions remained loyal , at the commander's suggestion they fixed a time for falling with the sword on all the vilest and foremost of the mutineers
 in quenching their thirst they are not equally moderate
there were five rows in connection with , and intersecting each other ; and whoever entered within them were likely to impale themselves on very sharp stakes .
 at last they tore up shrubs and roots and the grass that grew between the stones , and thus shewed an example of patience under privations , till at last they shamefully tarnished the lustre of their fame by sending envoys to civilis to beg for their lives
 when the battle was begun by the horse , there were observed at a distance by both sides the colors of two legions , which caius fabius had sent round by the further bridge to reinforce our men , suspecting , as the event verified , that the enemy's generals would take advantage of the opportunity which fortune had put in their way , to attack our men . 
 that the praetor at rome , the propraetor or proconsul in the provinces , should give judicial precedence to all cases against the collectors
 pompey was at this time in candavia , and was on his march from macedonia to his winter quarters in apollonia and dyrrachium ; but surprised at the unexpected news , he determined to go to apollonia by speedy marches , to prevent caesar from becoming master of all the maritime states . 
 thereby young men acquired from the first great experience and confidence , and a very large stock of discrimination , for they were studying in broad daylight , in the very thick of the conflict , where no one can say anything foolish or self-contradictory without its being refuted by the judge , or ridiculed by the opponent , or , last of all , repudiated by the very counsel with him
 and as the country was mountainous , and the valleys narrow at the bottom , he inclosed them with piles sunk in the ground , and heaped up mold against them to keep in the water . 
 with him was his daughter , who , to say nothing of the now imminent peril , had all the fury of a long grief ever since she had seen the murderers of her husband plautus
after he perceived that all the forces of the belgae , which had been collected in one place , were approaching toward him , and learned from the scouts whom he had sent out , and from the remi , that they were then not far distant , he hastened to lead his army over the aisne , which is on the borders of the remi , and there pitched his camp .
 the suevi , till their heads are grey , affect the fashion of drawing back their unkempt locks , and often they are knotted on the very top of the head
 the apparel worn indiscriminately by both sexes , or that peculiar luxury of women which , for the sake of jewels , diverts our wealth to strange or hostile nations
 for he had determined that they ought to be restored rather by the judgment of the people than appear admitted to it by his bounty : that he might neither appear ungrateful in repaying an obligation , nor arrogant in depriving the people of their prerogative of exercising this bounty . 
 paullinus and celsus no longer opposed , for they would not seem to put the emperor in the way of peril , and these same men who suggested the baser policy prevailed on him to retire to brixellum , and thus secure from the hazards of the field , to reserve himself for the administration of empire
 he argued that the highest issues turned on trivial causes , and that the fall of the house of germanicus might one day move the old man's remorse
 having advanced two days , he came to the river bagrada , and there left caius caninius rebilus , the lieutenant , with the legions ; and went forward himself with the horse to view the cornelian camp , because that was reckoned a very eligible position for encamping . 
 having joined this to his other ships , he made good his voyage to massilia , and having sent in a galley privately , acquaints domitius and the massilians of his arrival , and earnestly encourages them to hazard another battle with brutus's fleet with the addition of his aid . 
 gaul , besides remembering vindex , was bound to galba by the recently conceded privileges of citizenship , and by the diminution of its future tribute
 we have even ventured on the ocean itself in these parts
 the choice which begins with us will be a substitute for freedom
 of all his virtues , as he counted them , there was none on which tiberius so prided himself as his ability to dissemble , and he was therefore the more irritated at an attempt to expose what he was hiding
then at last ariovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp .
 night terminated an indecisive conflict
 and whether he applied his powers to vice or virtue , was always equally energetic
 they all live in filth and sloth , and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the sarmatæ
acco , who had been the author of that enterprise , on being informed of his arrival , orders the people to assemble in the towns ; to them , while attempting this , and before it could be accomplished , news is brought that the romans are close at hand : through necessity they give over their design and send embassadors to caesar for the purpose of imploring pardon ; they make advances to him through the aedui , whose state was from ancient times under the protection of rome .
 his kinsfolk and connections were loaded with honours
 our ancestors always suspected the temper of their slaves , even when they were born on the same estates , or in the same houses with themselves and thus inherited from their birth an affection for their masters
 it was really from a lust of sovereignty that he had excited the veterans by bribery , had , when a young man and a subject , raised an army , tampered with the consul's legions , and feigned an attachment to the faction of pompeius
while those things are being sought for and got together , after a night's interval , about 6000 men of that canton which is called the verbigene , whether terrified by fear , lest after delivering up their arms , they should suffer punishment , or else induced by the hope of safety , because they supposed that , amid so vast a multitude of those who had surrendered themselves , their flight might either be concealed or entirely overlooked , having at night-fall departed out of the camp of the helvetii , hastened to the rhine and the territories of the germans .
 even the colonnades with which it was surrounded formed an admirable outwork
 but faenius rufus had not equal spirit he even put his laments into his will
 this , they said , has strengthened vespasian no less than the exertions of primus antonius and mucianus
 in the meanwhile they had massacred all the germans who were scattered throughout their dwellings
 unless any one hinders me , i who suggest will execute the plan
he , when marcus messala and marcus piso were consuls , incited by lust of sovereignty , formed a conspiracy among the nobility , and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their possessions , that it would be very easy , since they excelled all in valour , to acquire the supremacy of the whole of gaul .
 again , to tamper with the servants of a woman who , from her familiarity with crime , was on her guard against treachery , appeared to be extremely difficult , and then , too , she had fortified her constitution by the use of antidotes
 during the same consulship a high price of corn almost brought on an insurrection for several days there were many clamorous demands made in the theatre with an unusual freedom of language towards the emperor
these affairs being announced to caesar in italy , at the time when he understood that matters in the city had been reduced to a more tranquil state by the energy of cneius pompey , he set out for transalpine gaul .
 meanwhile the tribunes of the people asked leave to exhibit at their own expense games to be named after augustus and added to the calendar as the augustales
 the gods , they said , forbade the old form to be changed
 had those energetic men , our aediles , first taken counsel with me , i do not know whether i should not have advised them to let alone vices so strong and so matured , rather than merely attain the result of publishing what are the corruptions with which we cannot cope
 let no one heed the tears of drusus or my own sorrow , or any stories invented to our discredit
 his brother titianus , and proculus , the prefect of the praetorian guard , ignorant and therefore impatient , declared that fortune , the gods , and the genius of otho , were with their counsels , and would be with their enterprises that no one might dare to oppose their views , they had taken refuge in flattery
 mucianus had four under his command in his peaceful province emulation , however , and the glory won by the neighbouring army had banished all tendency to sloth , and unbroken rest and exemption from the hardships of war had given them a vigour equivalent to the hardihood which the others had gained by their perils and their toils
 there was not a moment's delay
 fabius , according to his orders , by using expedition , dislodged the party from the hills , and by hasty marches came up with the army of afranius . 
 the contest depended entirely on dispatch , which should first get possession of the defile and the mountains . 
 this vast extent of country is not merely possessed , but densely peopled , by the chauci , the noblest of the german races , a nation who would maintain their greatness by righteous dealing
 so again miletus relied on king darius
 hemmed in , as it were , and enmeshed , the gods have delivered them into our hands
 the rest formed into a body , and being alarmed by the unexpected danger , wrapped their left arms in their cloaks , and drew their swords , and in this manner , depending on the nearness of their camp , defended themselves against the spaniards , and the horse , and made good their retreat to the camp , where they were protected by the cohorts which were on guard . 
 noble ladies too actually played disgusting parts , and in the grove , with which augustus had surrounded the lake for the naval fight , there were erected places for meeting and refreshment , and every incentive to excess was offered for sale
 profuse liberality would be scandalous whether all or nothing were conceded to the soldiery , the state was equally in jeopardy
 the power of the decemvirs did not last beyond two years , nor was the consular jurisdiction of the military tribunes of long duration
 soon afterwards he summoned an assembly , and enlarged on the dignity of the capital and the unanimity of the senate and people in his favour of the party of vitellius he spoke with moderation , charging the legions with ignorance rather than with crime , and making no mention of vitellius himself this moderation was either his own , or was due to the writer of the speech , who , fearing for himself , abstained from invectives against vitellius for otho was believed to avail himself of the abilities of galerius trachalus in civil matters , just as he employed those of celsus and paullinus in war
 the othonianists , who could take a more deliberate and certain aim , poured down their javelins on the german cohorts as they recklessly advanced to the attack with fierce war-cries , brandishing their shields above their shoulders after the manner of their country , and leaving their bodies unprotected
 the sacred virgins were sent back with honour , but the answer returned to vitellius was , that all ordinary intercourse of war had been broken off by the murder of sabinus and the conflagration of the capitol
 but these and other punishments of guilty men i shall describe in due course
 crimes gain by hasty action , better counsels by delay at all events , you will still have the same facilities of going out , if need be , whereas , your retreat , should you repent of having gone , will be in the power of another
he himself began the battle at the head of the right wing , because he had observed that part of the enemy to be the least strong .
 civilis , giving up all hope of a successful assault , again sat down to blockade the camp at his leisure , and undermined the fidelity of the legions by the promises of his emissaries
 thus , forsooth , the adhesion of one fleet would be worth eight legions
 then , as evening approached , the consul's quaestor was sent to thrasea , who was passing his time in his garden
 custom or law there was none
 it was his own profligacy , his own brutality , and that , though there had been before no precedent of an emperor condemned by his own people
 anxiously considering how he was to rid the senate of men of notorious infamy , he preferred a gentle method , recently devised , to one which accorded with the sternness of antiquity , and advised each to examine his own case and seek the privilege of laying aside his rank
when that assembly was dismissed , the same chiefs of states , who had before been to caesar , returned , and asked that they might be allowed to treat with him privately concerning the safety of themselves and of all .
 julius mansuetus , a spaniard , enlisting in the legion rapax , had left at home a son of tender age
 the freedmen in their excessive power were now putting up everything for sale the slaves caught with greedy hands at immediate gain , and , reflecting on their master's age , hastened to be rich
eporedirix and viridomarus , youths of the greatest promise , submit reluctantly to vercingetorix .
 timber could not fail him from the number of trees , nor corn , with which the lands abounded . 
 the red hair and large limbs of the inhabitants of caledonia point clearly to a german origin
 besides , the charm of indolence steals over us , and the idleness which at first we loathed we afterwards love
 but one speech of his had gone to the extremity of a gross insult to the senate for he had repeatedly declared that it was in his power to decide whether the proconsuls who had governed crete should receive the thanks of the province
 it was to this effect 
 it winds between the visurgis and a hill range , its breadth varying as the river banks recede or the spurs of the hills project on it
 yet it is at their feasts that they generally consult on the reconciliation of enemies , on the forming of matrimonial alliances , on the choice of chiefs , finally even on peace and war , for they think that at no time is the mind more open to simplicity of purpose or more warmed to noble aspirations
 the populace of the town , always inclined to be suspicious , believed that combustibles had been purposely introduced into the building by certain persons from the neighbouring colonies , who viewed it with envious and jealous eyes , because there was not in italy another building so capacious
 for they are not insulted by tribute , nor ground down by the tax-gatherer
 such was the end of cremona , 286 years after its foundation
 germanicus , however , who had not yet learnt how much he was blamed for his expedition , sailed up the nile from the city of canopus as his starting-point
 the buildings , which during a long period of peace had grown up like a town near the camp , were destroyed , lest they might be useful to the enemy
 the men and the women are alike supplied by the chase
 meanwhile italy was thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money , the provinces were ruined , as also the allied nations and the free states , as they were called
 britain will be with you the german auxiliaries will follow your standard
 the example was followed by the veterans , who were soon afterwards sent into raetia , nominally to defend the province against a threatened invasion of the suevi but really that they might tear themselves from a camp stamped with the horror of a dreadful remedy no less than with the memory of guilt
they acknowledge this sort of influence and power only .
 the cohorts being beaten back to the wall , and some being driven by their fears into the town , an easy retreat was afforded to our men . 
 there were several who supported this but the consuls did not venture to put the motion without the emperor's knowledge , though they recorded the senate's general opinion , to see whether he would sanction the arrangement , considering that only a few were opposed to it , while some loudly complained that the irreverent spirit which freedom had fostered , had broken into such excess , that freedmen would ask their patrons' advice as to whether they should treat them with violence , or , as legally , their equals , and would actually threaten them with blows , at the same time recommending them not to punish
 it would be no grievance for the enfranchised to have to keep their freedom by the same respectful behaviour which had procured it for them
 well , we also gave hostages to the etruscans , and passed under the yoke of the samnites
 this decree was variously carried out , and , while retained as law , was powerless or effectual , according as the person , who happened to be accused , was influential or helpless
having received these tidings , galba , since the works of the winter-quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed , nor was sufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other provisions , speedily summoning a council , began to anxiously inquire their opinions .
 caesar , feeling some trouble on this account , wrote in severe terms to his officers at brundusium , and gave them orders that as soon as they found the wind to answer , they should not let the opportunity of setting sail pass by , if they were even to steer their course to the shore of apollonia : because there they might run their ships on ground . 
 thence arose a suspicion that the war was being kindled with the consent of the legates , and that everything which had happened , or was apprehended , was due , not to the cowardice of the troops , or to the strength of the enemy , but to the treachery of the generals
 he summoned an assembly , and explained to them the bidding of the god , the visions of ptolemy and himself , and the miseries that were gathering about them
this single canton having left their country , within the recollection of our fathers , had slain lucius cassius the consul , and had made his army pass under the yoke .
the interior portion of britain is inhabited by those of whom they say that it is handed down by tradition that they were born in the island itself : the maritime portion by those who had passed over from the country of the belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war ; almost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which being sprung they went thither , and having waged war , continued there and began to cultivate the lands .
when these were delivered , and all the arms in the town collected , he went from that place into the territories of the ambiani , who , without delay , surrendered themselves and all their possessions .
 tiridates is about to go , a spectacle to the world , little better than a prisoner
he himself , a little after , marched out in silence , and , at the head of three legions , seeks that place to which he had ordered the ships to be brought .
 vitellius , as soon as artabanus had fled and his people were inclined to have a new king , urged tiridates to seize the advantage thus offered , and then led the main strength of the legions and the allies to the banks of the euphrates
 princes , he said , must often visit the extremities of their empire
 soon afterwards it was clearly seen what a narrow margin there is between such science and delusion and in what obscurity truth is veiled
 as for my daughter , i admit that it is by compulsion she has been brought here
 just before december 1 in the preceding year , aulus vitellius had visited lower germany , and had carefully inspected the winter quarters of the legions
 octavius , on the other hand , now remonstrated , now threatened his good name , he protested , was lost , his means exhausted , and as for his life , which was all that was left to him , he surrendered it to her mercy
 for in all battles it is the eye which is first vanquished
 nor was this the case only among the troops of caecina , who indeed laid all the blame upon his soldiers , more ready , as he said , for mutiny than for battle
 even vitellius , tremblingly alive as he was to all suspicions , had no doubt of his innocence
 at last , when there were others ready to be abettors of a mutiny , he asked , in the tone of a demagogue , why , like slaves , they submitted to a few centurions and still fewer tribunes
 at the same time caesar ordered his third line to advance , which till then had not been engaged , but had kept their post . 
while caesar remains in these parts for the purpose of procuring ships , embassadors come to him from a great portion of the morini , to plead their excuse respecting their conduct on the late occasion ; alleging that it was as men uncivilized , and as those who were unacquainted with our custom , that they had made war upon the roman people , and promising to perform what he should command .
 many thought the rumour had been invented and circulated by the othonianists , who were now mingling with the crowd , and who disseminated these false tidings of success to draw galba out of the palace
 in a few days the 14th legion , itself highly renowned , will arrive with the troops from moesia
 then on all sides officers of state cast aside the insignia of office , and shunned the retinues of their friends and domestics aged men and women wandered in the darkness of night about the various streets of the city few went to their homes , most sought the houses of friends , or some obscure hiding-place in the dwelling of their humblest dependents
 corporal punishments and confiscations of property were unknown
 thus caius gracchus compared with the elder cato is full and copious crassus compared with gracchus is polished and ornate cicero compared with either is lucid , graceful , and lofty
 as might have been expected from their known characters , tigellinus had the greater influence with the prince , and was the associate of his most secret profligacy , while rufus enjoyed the favour of the people and of the soldiers , and this , he found , prejudiced him with nero
 for these positions were secured from protracted siege by a year's supply
 the populace stood by and watched the combatants and , as though it had been a mimic conflict , encouraged first one party and then the other by their shouts and plaudits
 meanwhile the terror-stricken varus plunged into the disordered ranks of his friends , and brought a panic with him
 there had been no mutiny among the legions , nothing indeed but some demonstrations against the parthians , attended with various success
but the soldiers advanced with such speed and such ardor , though they stood above the water by their heads only , that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legions and of the horse , and quitted the banks , and committed themselves to flight .
 the men whom i have named now consulted how these conversations might fall within the hearing of more persons
our men making an attack on them vigorously , repulsed them ; nor did they cease to pursue them until the horse , relying on relief , as they saw the legions behind them , drove the enemy precipitately before them , and slaying a great number of them , did not give them the opportunity either of rallying , or halting , or leaping from their chariots .
 as for himself , he had been attacked by twelve legions led by tiberius , and had preserved untarnished the glory of the germans , and then on equal terms the armies had parted
 he thought that the war might be easily protracted in an island , if he was provided with corn and shipping . 
 there are still , he said , faithful provinces , victorious armies , the fortune of the empire , and avenging gods
 lest the woman should think herself to stand apart from aspirations after noble deeds and from the perils of war , she is reminded by the ceremony which inaugurates marriage that she is her husband's partner in toil and danger , destined to suffer and to dare with him alike both in peace and in war the yoked oxen , the harnessed steed , the gift of arms , proclaim this fact she must live and die with the feeling that she is receiving what she must hand down to her children neither tarnished nor depreciated , what future daughters-in-law may receive , and may be so passed on to her grand-children
 a few days after the departure of caecina , vitellius had hurried fabius valens to the seat of war , and was now seeking to hide his apprehensions from himself by indulgence
 when the man advised him to sever his veins , he replied that , though he had resolved in his heart to die , he would not let a cutthroat have the glory of the service
 nero's displeasure at this was the deeper , since this same thrasea had sung in a tragedian's dress at patavium , his birth-place , in some games instituted by the trojan antenor
 again , the execution of capito was a subject of indignation , even with those who could not complain of its injustice
 thus the provinces echoed with the bustle of preparing fleets , armies , and the implements of war
 vitellius even in prosperity was unequal to his position , and he is proportionately unnerved by disaster
then stones having been cast from every quarter , the enemy were dislodged , and their tower set on fire .
 vinius , the consul , and cornelius laco , prefect of the praetorian guard
 but a few days before , lucius domitius , having discovered the intention of the massilians , and having procured three ships , two of which he gave up to his friends , went on board the third himself , having got a brisk wind , put out to sea . 
 from unseemly flatteries they passed by degrees to savage acts
 we are told that galba , taking hold of piso's hand , spoke to this effect 
 do not , senators , think only of sejanus's last day , but of his sixteen years of power
 yet regulus lived after this , protected by his retiring habits , and by the fact that he was a man of newly-risen family and of wealth which did not provoke envy
 the vestal virgins also presented themselves with a letter from vitellius to antonius
 one atilius , of the freedman class , having undertaken to build an amphitheatre at fidena for the exhibition of a show of gladiators , failed to lay a solid foundation to frame the wooden superstructure with beams of sufficient strength for he had neither an abundance of wealth , nor zeal for public popularity , but he had simply sought the work for sordid gain thither flocked all who loved such sights and who during the reign of tiberius had been wholly debarred from such amusements
 on that day he had performed all his duties as consul , and was entertaining some guests , fearless of danger , or perhaps by way of hiding his fears , when the soldiers entered and announced to him the tribune's summons
 rewards were not needed when everything right was pursued on its own merits
 even then their savage spirit was seized with desire to march against the enemy , as an atonement for their frenzy , and it was felt that the shades of their fellow-soldiers could be appeased only by exposing such impious breasts to honourable scars
 as he was on his march along the frontier of the mardi , he was incessantly attacked by that tribe which is trained to guerilla warfare , and defended by mountains against an invader

 nor did ptolemaeus fail to play his part
if these things were to be disclosed to ariovistus , that he doubts not that he would inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in his possession , that caesar could , either by his own influence and by that of his army , or by his late victory , or by name of the roman people , intimidate him , so as to prevent a greater number of germans being brought over the rhine , and could protect all gaul from the outrages of ariovistus .

 even tutor made no haste to occupy with troops the upper bank of the rhine and the passes of the alps
 soon after piso was killed , for there was on the spot one who recognized him , baebius massa , one of the procurators of africa , a name even then fatal to the good , and destined often to reappear among the causes of the sufferings which he had ere long to endure
vercingetorix , on hearing this circumstance , leads back his army into the country of the bituriges ; and after marching from it to gergovia , a town of the boii , whom caesar had settled there after defeating them in the helvetian war , and had rendered tributary to the aedui , he determined to attack it .
 after surveying the positions and relative distances of the stars , he first paused , then trembled , and the longer he gazed , the more was he agitated by amazement and terror , till at last he exclaimed that a perilous and well-nigh fatal crisis impended over him
immediately the whole host turn from pullo to him , supposing the other to be pierced through by the javelin .

 many thought it ridiculous
but the enemy , after they had made the discovery of their intended departure by the noise during the night and their not retiring to rest , having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the woods , in a suitable and concealed place , two miles from the camp , waited for the arrival of the romans : and when the greater part of the line of march had descended into a considerable valley , they suddenly presented themselves on either side of that valley , and began both to harass the rear and hinder the van from ascending , and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous to our men .
 nor indeed did the opposite side lack an advocate , who , after much criticism and ridicule of old times , maintained the superiority of the eloquence of our own days to the great orators of the past
 the roman citizens built wooden towers , the better to secure it ; but when they were unable to resist , on account of the smallness of their numbers , being weakened by several wounds , they stooped to the last resource , and set at liberty all the slaves old enough to bear arms ; and cutting the hair off the women's heads , made ropes for their engines . 
 the son of a freedwoman , who had prostituted a handsome person among the slaves and freedmen of the emperors , he gave out that he was the offspring of caius caesar , for he happened to be of tall stature and to have a fierce look , or possibly caius caesar , who liked even harlots , had also amused himself with the man's mother

 the batavian cohorts were sent back to germany , lest they should venture on further violence destiny was thus simultaneously preparing the occasions of civil and of foreign war
 the solitude of the place was , i believe , its chief attraction , for a harbourless sea surrounds it and even for a small vessel it has but few safe retreats , nor can any one land unknown to the sentries
 for an immense host of ligii , with other tribes , was advancing , attracted by the fame of the opulent realm which vannius had enriched during thirty years of plunder and of tribute
 those who are nearest to the gauls are also like them , either from the permanent influence of original descent , or , because in countries which run out so far to meet each other , climate has produced similar physical qualities
 at bononia they posted men on the different roads to make enquiries of every newcomer

 verginius encouraged the studies of our youth by his eloquence
 neither were the soldiers , though wearied , nor the horse , though few and exhausted with fatigue , deficient in ardor to engage , and courage : but the latter were in number but two hundred : the rest had dropped behind on the march . 
 and so , what might long have sufficed for their necessities , was wantonly wasted in a few days
the sail yards , as we have said , being brought down , although two and three ships surrounded each one , the soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the ships of the enemy ; and , after the barbarians observed this taking place , as a great many of their ships were beaten , and as no relief for that evil could be discovered , they hastened to seek safety in flight .
having come to this resolution , they fortify their towns , convey corn into them from the country parts , bring together as many ships as possible to venetia , where it appeared caesar would at first carry on the war .
 he served his military apprenticeship in britain to the satisfaction of suetonius paullinus , a painstaking and judicious officer , who , to test his merits , selected him to share his tent
 indeed we have understood that even the gauls were once renowned in war

 trifling errors he treated with leniency , serious offences with severity
 the emperor likewise widened the sacred precincts of the capital , in conformity with the ancient usage , according to which , those who had enlarged the empire were permitted also to extend the boundaries of rome but roman generals , even after the conquest of great nations , had never exercised this right , except lucius sulla and the divine augustus
 his mother , who was living here on her own estate , was murdered
 then suetonius paullinus , thinking that it befitted his reputation , which was such that no one at that period was looked upon as a more skilful soldier , to give an opinion on the whole conduct of the war , contended that impatience would benefit the enemy , while delay would serve their own cause

 he declared that an order to put piso to death had been given to the centurion , and that galerianus , his cousin and son-in-law , had perished
 caesar , on being informed of these transactions , pursued measures suggested by the nature of the country . 
he , distrusting his own safety and that of all , goes forth from his tent unarmed ; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is in the utmost danger ; he snatches arms from those nearest , and stations himself at the gate .

 when the battle was begun , no effort of valor was wanting to the massilians , but , mindful of the instructions which they had a little before received from their friends , they fought with such spirit as if they supposed that they would never have another opportunity to attempt a defense , and as if they believed that those whose lives should be endangered in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the citizens , who , if the city was taken , must undergo the same fortune of war . 
 to pomponius was decreed the honour of a triumph a mere fraction of his renown with the next generation , with whom his poems constitute his chief glory
that the suessiones were their nearest neighbors and possessed a very extensive and fertile country ; that among them , even in our own memory , diviciacus , the most powerful man of all gaul , had been king ; who had held the government of a great part of these regions , as well as of britain ; that their king at present was galba ; that the direction of the whole war was conferred by the consent of all , upon him , on account of his integrity and prudence ; that they had twelve towns ; that they had promised 50 , 000 armed men ; and that the nervii , who are reckoned the most warlike among them , and are situated at a very great distance , as many ; the atrebates 15 , 000 ; the ambiani , 10 , 000 ; the morini , 25 , 000 ; the menapii , 9 , 000 ; the caleti , 10 , 000 ; the veliocasses and the viromandui as many ; the aduatuci 19 , 000 ; that the condrusi , the eburones , the caeraesi , the paemani , who are called by the common name of germans , they thought , to the number of 40 , 000 .
 the line of the vitellianists was formed without hurry , for , though the enemy was close at hand , the sight of their arms was intercepted by the thick brushwood
 all the more vigorously did vologeses press the besieged , now attacking the legions' entrenchments , and now again the fortress , which guarded those whose years unfitted them for war he advanced closer than is the parthian practice , seeking to lure the enemy to an engagement by such rashness
 cappadocia meanwhile , which had been reduced to the form of a province , received as its governor quintus veranius
 he wrote to vitellius asking for aid

 this was the most deplorable and disgraceful event that had happened to the commonwealth of rome since the foundation of the city for now , assailed by no foreign enemy , with heaven ready to be propitious , had our vices only allowed , the seat of jupiter supremely good and great , founded by our ancestors with solemn auspices to be the pledge of empire , the seat , which neither porsenna , when the city was surrendered , nor the gauls , when it was captured , had been able to violate , was destroyed by the madness of our emperors

 and so , as the rest too were for averting perils which did not concern them , the ampsivarian tribe in its isolation retreated to the usipii and tubantes driven out of these countries , they sought refuge with the chatti and then with the cherusci , and after long wanderings , as destitute outcasts , received now as friends now as foes , their entire youth were slain in a strange land , and all who could not fight , were apportioned as booty

 she therefore told her father by message that she cast hope aside and yielded to necessity
 pontiffs had often performed the rites to jupiter when his priest was hindered by illness or by public duty
 ostorius having ascertained by a survey the inaccessible and the assailable points of the position , led on his furious men , and crossed the river without difficulty
 a decree of the senate was then passed for the expulsion of the astrologers from italy , stringent but ineffectual
then our men , exhorting one another that so great a disgrace should not be incurred , all leaped from the ship .

 this had made them long faithful to nero , and kindled their zeal for otho
 at rome meanwhile were being sown the seeds of bloodshed to come even after tiberius's death
immediately after this retreat , the auxiliaries who had assembled from all sides , departed ; nor after that time did the enemy ever engage with us in very large numbers .
 touched by the reproach , a few troopers , not more than a hundred in number , made a stand the locality favoured them , for the road was at that point particularly narrow , while the bridge over the stream which crossed it had been broken down , and the stream itself , with its varying channel and its precipitous banks , checked their flight
 at the same moment , civilis , acting either on some bold impulse or by a preconcerted plan , rushed into the tungrian column , exclaiming in a loud voice , we have not taken up arms in order that the batavi and treveri may rule over the nations
 but they had a specially strong liking for corbulo
caesar had , as we have previously narrated , availed himself of the faithful and valuable services of this commius , in britain , in former years : in consideration of which merits he had exempted from taxes his state , and had conferred on commius himself the country of the morini .
 they found but one wound
 for verses come naturally to bassus in his own home , and pretty and charming they are , though the result of them is that when , with the labour of a whole year , through entire days and the best part of the nights , he has hammered out , with the midnight oil , a single book , he is forced actually to beg and canvass for people who will condescend to be his hearers , and not even this without cost to himself
 he was , however , diverted from his purpose by the deplorable news that this cohort had been entirely destroyed by a stratagem of the agrippinenses , who , having stupefied the germans by a profuse entertainment and abundance of wine , fastened the doors , set fire to the houses , and burned them
 indeed , the blind rage of so many had robbed him of his resolution
 at last , in the presence of a few intimate associates , germanicus addressed him in language such as suppressed resentment suggests , to which piso replied with haughty apologies
 i may regard with admiration an earlier period , but i acquiesce in the present , and , while i pray for good emperors , i can endure whomsoever we may have

 one of them said , in answer to the furious menaces of tigellinus , that octavia's person was purer than his mouth

 the roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in the same manner as the joists were laid on the braces , the musculus was covered with tiles and mortar , to secure it against fire , which might be thrown from the wall . 
 rulers always suspect and hate the man who has been named for the succession
 who will now tolerate an advocate who begins by speaking of the feebleness of his constitution , as is usual in the openings of corvinus
 but caelius proved more severe to those very persons for whose advantage it had been designed ; and starting from this beginning , in order that he might not appear to have engaged in so dishonorable an affair without effecting something , he promulgated a law that all debts should be discharged in six equal payments , of six months each , without interest . 
but a worse thing had befallen the victorious sequani than the vanquished aedui , for ariovistus the king of the germans , had settled in their territories , and had seized upon a third of their land , which was the best in the whole of gaul , and was now ordering them to depart from another third part , because a few months previously 24 , 000 men of the harudes had come to him , for whom room and settlements must be provided .
 the agents of the deed were publius celer , a roman knight , and helius , a freedman , men who had the charge of the emperor's domains in asia
among the other usages of their life , they differ in this from almost all other nations , that they do not permit their children to approach them openly until they are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war ; and they regard it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence of his father .
however , none of the german states could be induced to cross the rhine , since they had twice essayed it , they said , in the war with ariovistus and in the passage of the tenchtheri there ; that fortune was not to be tempted any more .
 it was this necessity , or a happy chance , that restored the fallen fortunes of the party forming themselves into strong and close ranks , they received the attack of the vitellianists , who were now imprudently scattered
 to so great height was their expectation raised , that they were carried away , heart and soul , each to different objects , what would become of the corfinians , what of domitius , what of lentulus , what of the rest ; what event would be the consequence of another . 
the suspicion of the gauls are increased , and all their forces are marched to that place to defend it .
both these , moreover , were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick , laid in at their extremities between two braces on each side , and in consequence of these being in different directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other , so great was the strength of the work , and such the arrangement of the materials , that in proportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge , so much the closer were its parts held fastened together .
 vitellius sent envoys to the legions and their legates , who were to say that the army of upper germany had revolted from galba , that it was consequently necessary for them , either to make war on the revolters , or , if they preferred peace and harmony , to create an emperor , and who were to suggest , that it would be less perilous to accept than to look for a chief

 all this was true , and the tribunes and prefects heaped on their men the same reproaches
 then followed as great a burst of joy , though from a less worthy cause , when the destruction of tigellinus was achieved
 we have read that the panegyrics pronounced by arulenus rusticus on rictus thrasea , and by herennius senecio on priscus helvidius , were made capital crimes , that not only their persons but their very books were objects of rage , and that the triumvirs were commissioned to burn in the forum those works of splendid genius
 the emperor now made all this known to the senate , and extolled the good offices of quirinus to himself , while he censured marcus lollius , whom he charged with encouraging caius caesar in his perverse and quarrelsome behaviour
 last of all , caractacus himself all the rest stooped in their fear to abject supplication not so the king , who neither by humble look nor speech sought compassion
 claudius further added that sacrifices after the ordinances of king tullius , and atonements were to be offered by the pontiffs in the grove of diana , amid general ridicule at the idea devising penalties and propitiations for incest at such a time
 may all the gods and goddesses destroy me more miserably than i feel myself to be daily perishing , if i know at know at this moment what to write to you , senators , how to write it , or what , in short , not to write
 i hardly suppose that any one reads cæsar's speech for decius the samnite , or that of brutus for king deiotarus , or other works equally dull and cold , unless it is some one who also admires their poems
 the ground there was firm , and the gugerni , to whom the post had been allotted , were careless
 soldiers hung about them , and every message , every visit , their public and their private life were i may say regularly chronicled and persons were actually suborned to advise them to flee to the armies of germany , or when the forum was most crowded , to clasp the statue of statue of the divine augustus and appeal to the protection of the people and senate
 then they went down and took their seat among the senators
 around were woods on a gradual slope , which arminius now completely occupied , as soon as by a short route and quick march he had outstripped troops heavily laden with baggage and arms
 there all are foreigners and enemies
 it was very acceptable and agreeable to afranius's soldiers , as might be easily known from their signs of joy , that they who expected some injury after this defeat , should obtain without solicitation the reward of a dismissal . 
 drusus replied to piso that if certain insinuations were true , he must be foremost in his resentment , but he preferred to believe that they were false and groundless , and that germanicus's death need be the ruin of no one
 still this had not made them less keen to seize on palaces and gardens and all the wealth of the empire , while a sad and needy throng of nobles , whom with their children galba had restored to their country , received no relief from the compassion of the emperor
 many by that means were recovered
the army of the gauls had filled all the space under the wall , comprising a part of the hill which looked to the rising sun , and had drawn in front a trench and a stone wall six feet high .
 the senators were panic-stricken , for how few of their number were not connected by alliance or by friendship with this multitude of men of rank ! celsus however , tribune of a city cohort , and now one of the prosecutors , saved appius and calvisius from the peril
 he also had been accustomed to inveigh mercilessly against vitellius , and had thus left himself no hope in the event of defeat
 at the same moment he saw the youth ascend to heaven in a blaze of fire
 the hand was instantly restored to its use , and the light of day again shone upon the blind
 then came the civil wars , and the arms of our leaders were turned against their country , and even when there was peace , there was a long neglect of britain this augustus spoke of as policy tiberius as an inherited maxim that caius cæsar meditated an invasion of britain is perfectly clear , but his purposes , rapidly formed , were easily changed , and his vast attempts on germany had failed claudius was the first to renew the attempt , and conveyed over into the island some legions and auxiliaries , choosing vespasian to share with him the campaign , whose approaching elevation had this beginning
 valerius pontius suffered the same degradation for having indicted the defendants before the praetor to save them from being prosecuted in the court of the city-prefect , purposing meanwhile to defeat justice on some legal pretext and subsequently by collusion
 when he heard the senate's decision , he led helvidius and demetrius into a chamber , and having laid bare the arteries of each arm , he let the blood flow freely , and , as he sprinkled it on the ground , he called the quaestor to his side and said , we pour out a libation to jupiter the deliverer
 sixty sestertia , which domitius had brought with him and lodged in the public treasury , being brought to caesar by the magistrates of corfinium , he gave them back to domitius , that he might not appear more moderate with respect to the life of men than in money matters , though he knew that it was public money , and had been given by pompey to pay his army . 
 while superstition still swayed them , the general should apply terror by removing the leaders of the mutiny
 they admired the ancients
 otho , meanwhile , who had nothing to hope while the state was tranquil , and whose whole plans depended on revolution , was being roused to action by a combination of many motives , by a luxury that would have embarrassed even an emperor , by a poverty that a subject could hardly endure , by his rage against galba , by his envy of piso
when he ordered the brothers of litavicus to be arrested , he discovers that they had fled a short time before to the camp of the enemy .
 still , to avoid keeping the soldiers in idleness , the first completed the embankment begun sixty-three years before by drusus to confine the waters of the rhine , while vetus prepared to connect the moselle and the arar by a canal , so that troops crossing the sea and then conveyed on the rhone and arar might sail by this canal into the moselle and the rhine , and thence to the ocean thus the difficulties of the route being removed , there would be communication for ships between the shores of the west and of the north
 pompey , being informed of what had passed at corfinium , marches from luceria to canusium , and thence to brundusium . 
 though they were without baggage , and had marched out only to fight , it was sufficient protection to them that they had arms , and were victorious
 people extolled too the number of his consulships , in which he had equalled valerius corvus and caius marius combined , the continuance for thirty-seven years of the tribunitian power , the title of imperator twenty-one times earned , and his other honours which had either frequently repeated or were wholly new
there is an ox of the shape of a stag , between whose ears a horn rises from the middle of the forehead , higher and straighter than those horns which are known to us .

 she would go anywhere in the world , where she might hear of the insults heaped on the emperor , rather than witness them , and be also involved in his perils
 in vespasian there appeared no sign of elation or arrogance , or of any change arising from his changed fortunes
 vitellius accordingly , who used the name of censor to screen a slave's trickeries , and looked forward to new despotisms , already impending , associated himself in agrippina's plans , with a view to her favour , and began to bring charges against silanus , whose sister , junia calvina , a handsome and lively girl , had shortly before become his daughter-in-law
 vitellius ordered the centurions nonnius , donatius , romilius , and calpurnius , of whom i have before spoken , to be executed they had been convicted of the crime of fidelity , among rebels the worst of crimes
 their cause was pleaded by a man , famous among those nations and loyal to rome , boiocalus by name , who reminded us that on the cheruscan revolt he had been imprisoned by the order of arminius , that afterwards he had served under the leadership of tiberius and of germanicus , and that to a fifty years' obedience he was adding the merit of subjecting his tribe to our dominion

 louder shouts here met him from the crowd , which hindered him from entering a private house , and invited him to return to the palace
 when scipio came to the temple , letters were delivered to him from pompey , in the presence of several senators , whom he had called upon to attend him ; informing him that caesar had crossed the sea with his legions ; that scipio should hasten to him with his army , and postpone all other business . 
on their departure , the bituriges immediately unite themselves to the arverni .
when each army was in sight of the other , and was pitching their camp almost opposite that of the enemy , scouts being distributed in every quarter , lest the romans should build a bridge and bring over their troops ; it was to caesar a matter attended with great difficulties , lest he should be hindered from passing the river during the greater part of the summer , as the allier can not generally be forded before the autumn .
 it is idle to shelter our own weakness under other names
 meanwhile the population of cremona was roughly handled by the soldiers , who were just beginning a massacre , when their fury was mitigated by the entreaties of the generals

 trachalus was protected against his accusers by galeria the wife of vitellius
 then ensued a universal panic , and while the rest fled hither and thither , every one feigning grief or ignorance , caius caesar , in silent stupor , passed from the highest hopes to the extremity of apprehension
 other reasons , however , were alleged
 on the raft stood companies of the praetorian cohorts and cavalry , with a breastwork in front of them , from which catapults and balistas might be worked
 it was also reported that antonius had urged scribonianus crassus , whom an illustrious descent added to the honours of his brother made a conspicuous person , to assume the supreme power and it was understood that a number of accomplices would not have failed to support him , had not the proposal been rejected by scribonianus , who was a man not easily to be tempted even by a certainty , and was proportionately apprehensive of risk
 for you will not , i imagine , deny that eloquence depends much less on art and theory than on capacity and practice , and our friends here seem by their looks to think the same
 rhadamistus too , seemingly mindful of his oath , neither unsheathed the sword nor used poison against his sister and uncle , but had them thrown on the ground and then smothered them under a mass of heavy clothes
 at any rate i should have perished before i was as yet conscious of all the disgraces of my army , while you would have chosen a general who though he might allow my death to pass unpunished would avenge the death of varus and his three legions
then at length titurius , as one who had provided nothing beforehand , was confused , ran to and fro , and set about arranging his troops ; these very things , however , he did timidly and in such a manner that all resources seemed to fail him : which generally happens to those who are compelled to take council in the action itself .
 while these and like topics were discussed , the infirmities of augustus increased , and some suspected guilt on his wife's part
 whenever he sought counsel on such matters , he would make use of the top of the house and of the confidence of one freedman , quite illiterate and of great physical strength
 this disaster was not forgotten when a furious conflagration damaged the capital to an unusual extent , reducing mount caelius to ashes
 for we have a vast force of horse and foot
 whom , as he passes by , do the ignorant mob and the men with the tunic oftener speak of by name and point out with the finger
they did this the more easily during a great part of the summer , because our ships were kept back by storms , and the difficulty of sailing was very great in that vast and open sea , with its strong tides and its harbors far apart and exceedingly few in number .
 they actually claimed the merit of having been traitors , attributing to their own dishonest counsels the long march before the battle , the fatigue of otho's troops , the entanglement of the line with the baggage-wagons , and many circumstances which were really accidental
 and let the statue over my tomb be not gloomy and scowling , but bright and laurel-crowned
 macro , nothing daunted , ordered the old emperor to be smothered under a huge heap of clothes , and all to quit the entrance-hall
what courage do you think would our relatives and friends have , if eighty thousand men were butchered in one spot , supposing that they should be forced to come to an action almost over our corpses ? do not utterly deprive them of your aid , for they have spurned all thoughts of personal danger on account of your safety ; nor by your folly , rashness , and cowardice , crush all gaul and doom it to an eternal slavery .
 now even the gods are beginning to pity us , for they are keeping away the roman general , and detaining his army far from us in another island

 felix meanwhile , by ill-timed remedies , stimulated disloyal acts while he had , as a rival in the worst wickedness , ventidius cumanus , who held a part of the province , which was so divided that galilea was governed by cumanus , samaria by felix the two peoples had long been at feud , and now less than ever restrained their enmity , from contempt of their rulers
 germanicus , however , pursued arminius as he fell back into trackless wilds , and as soon as he had the opportunity , ordered his cavalry to sally forth and scour the plains occupied by the enemy
 as a consequence , her slave-girls were examined under torture , and though some were forced by the intensity of agony into admitting falsehoods , most of them persisted in upholding the virtue of their mistress
 after the savage massacres in which greatness of renown was fatal , the survivors turned to wiser ways the new men who were often admitted into the senate from the towns , colonies and even the provinces , introduced their household thrift , and though many of them by good luck or energy attained an old age of wealth , still their former tastes remained
 when he pleaded that the sixty days given for deliberation had not yet expired , it was thought sufficient to decide vistilia's case , and she was banished out of sight to the island of seriphos

 in a state that was distracted by strife , and that from frequent changes in its rulers trembled on the verge between liberty and licence , even little matters were attended with great excitement
 he dispatched messengers to caesar , and confined himself in his camp for one day . 
 of all things human the most precarious and transitory is a reputation for power which has no strong support of its own
 the change did not escape nero his most intimate friends dreaded it , and begged him to beware of the arts of a woman , was always daring and was now false
 but this , on account of the season of the year , appeared tedious and troublesome . 
 the horse was caught and led through the neighbouring villages , and its owner ascertained
being accused in such a manner , he made the following reply to these charges : -that his moving his camp had been caused by want of forage , and had been done even by their advice ; that his approaching near the romans had been a measure dictated by the favorable nature of the ground , which would defend him by its natural strength ; that the service of the cavalry could not have been requisite in marshy ground , and was useful in that place to which they had gone ; that he , on his departure , had given the supreme command to no one intentionally , lest he should be induced by the eagerness of the multitude to hazard an engagement , to which he perceived that all were inclined , owing to their want of energy , because they were unable to endure fatigue any longer .
 this will be a pledge of your repentance , a guarantee of your loyalty

 it was the splendour of their name which drove verginius flavus and musonius rufus into exile
 the roman soldier is heavily armed and afraid to swim , while the german , who is accustomed to rivers , is favoured by the lightness of his equipment and the height of his stature
 then , with his characteristic fickleness , in the privacy of a banquet he granted the very distinction which he had publicly refused and honoured with the ring of knighthood this same asiaticus , a slave of infamous character , ever seeking power by unprincipled intrigues
pompey , to beg that he would spare him and his soldiers he , when addressed , replied , if he wishes to confer with him , it was permitted ; that he hoped what pertained to the safety of the soldiers could be obtained from the people ; that to him however certainly no injury would be done , and that he pledged his faith to that effect .
 the soldiers have the plunder of a city that is stormed , the generals of one which capitulates
 lucilius bassus , prefect of the ravenna fleet , finding that the troops wavered in purpose , from the fact that many were natives of dalmatia and pannonia , provinces held for vespasian , had attached them to the flavianist party
he induces him by great gifts and promises to go over to the enemy ; and informs of what he wished to be done .
 a very demoralizing custom had at this time become rife , of fictitious adoptions of children , on the eve of the elections or of the assignment of the provinces , by a number of childless persons , who , after obtaining along with real fathers praetorships and provinces , forthwith dismissed from paternal control the sons whom they had adopted
 some , scorning what met the eye , searched for hidden wealth , and dug up buried treasures , applying the scourge and the torture to the owners
and such great influence had he already acquired for himself in gaul by these means , that embassies were flocking to him in all directions , and seeking , publicly and privately , his favor and friendship .
 he was by no means sorry that they had the matter in their own hands , whether they preferred to war with all their might against rome , or to accept a bloodless peace
 day dawned , and with the sound of trumpets and fierce shouts , they were on the half-asleep barbarians , whose horses were tethered or roaming over distant pastures
 only the jew might approach the gates
 the march of the first body was accomplished in security , as civilis had not yet recovered
thither they proceeded with great speed , and arrived quite out of breath .
 at corinth , the capital of achaia , he received positive information of the death of galba , and found men who spoke confidently of the revolt of vitellius and of the fact of war in the anxiety of his mind , he sent a few of his friends , and carefully surveyed his position from both points of view
 they have also those songs of theirs , by the recital of which baritus , they call it , they rouse their courage , while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict
 there receiving acilius and marcus's letters , informing him of libo's and bibulus's demands , he left his legion behind him , and returned himself to oricum . 
 these dispositions did not escape the notice of civilis he determined to anticipate them , moved not only by weariness of his sufferings , but also by that clinging to life which often breaks the noblest spirits
 hence there was more ground for believing that the man , conscious of guilty complicity and fearing accusation , had slain vonones
 rumour added that the legions had been passed under the yoke , with other miserable disgraces , of which the armenians had borrowed imitations
 the rest , after their bravest men had been beaten back or wounded , were towards daybreak pushed back to the upper part of the fortress and there at last compelled to surrender
 rome meanwhile being a scene of ceaseless bloodshed , pomponius labeo , who was , as i have related , governor of moesia , severed his veins and let his life ebb from him
 valens , having started from the bay of pisa , was compelled , either by a calm or a contrary wind , to put in at the port of hercules monoecus

 seeing the consuls , in token of their grief , sitting on the ordinary benches , he reminded them of their high office and of their proper place
 antonius was a man of ready audacity marcellus had the glory of being the great-grandson of asinius pollio , and bore a character far from contemptible , except that he thought poverty the greatest of all evils
 gratitude is a burden , while there seems to be a profit in revenge they were consoled by seeing the slave of verginius capito , whom i have mentioned as the betrayer of tarracina , gibbeted in the very rings of knighthood , the gift of vitellius , which they had seen him wear
 thus elated and exulting over his people's slavery , he proceeded to the capitol , performed the thanksgiving , and then plunged into all the excesses , which , though ill-restrained , some sort of respect for his mother had for a while delayed

 severity would be dangerous

 or , if it is produced , it cannot be lasting formerly , when the people had power or when the patricians were in the ascendant , the popular temper and the methods of controlling it , had to be studied , and those who knew most accurately the spirit of the senate and aristocracy , had the credit of understanding the age and of being wise men so now , after a revolution , when rome is nothing but the realm of a single despot , there must be good in carefully noting and recording this period , for it is but few who have the foresight to distinguish right from wrong or what is sound from what is hurtful , while most men learn wisdom from the fortunes of others
 but pompey's deputies having executed their commission , began to converse with less restraint with the king's troops , and to advise them to act with friendship to pompey , and not to think meanly of his bad fortune . 
 but the mountaineers were cut down and broken by the first charge , as might be expected of men who had been hastily collected , who were not familiar with camps or with regular command , who saw no glory in victory , no infamy in flight
 the massilians themselves , confiding in the quickness of their ships , and the skill of their pilots , eluded ours , and evaded the shock , and as long as they were permitted by clear space , lengthening their line they endeavored to surround us , or to attack single ships with several of theirs , or to run across our ships , and carry away our oars , if possible ; but when necessity obliged them to come nearer , they had recourse , from the skill and art of the pilots , to the valor of the mountaineers . 
this part of gaul having been tranquilized , he applies himself entirely both in mind and soul to the war with the treviri and ambiorix .
 meanwhile the expectant people had surrounded the palace , impatient to learn the great secret , and those who sought to stifle the ill-concealed rumour did but spread it the more
 almost alone among barbarians they are content with one wife , except a very few among them , and these not from sensuality , but because their noble birth procures for them many offers of alliance the wife does not bring a dower to the husband , but the husband to the wife
 natalis shared with piso all his secret plans
 for in their intrenchments their woeful appearance had not been so noticeable
 the general knew this , and he marched , prepared both to advance and to fight
 we had unshaken peace at home we prospered in all our foreign relations , in the days when italy beyond the po was admitted to share our citizenship , and when , enrolling in our ranks the most vigorous of the provincials , under colour of settling our legions throughout the world , we recruited our exhausted empire
 soon after , the mighty menaces of caius cæsar were turned into a jest
 at home all was tranquil , and there were magistrates with the same titles
 but the impetuosity of the victors was checked
 among the slain was the father of a soldier , who was with his son
 twenty-one were chosen by lot from the chief men of the state
 the roman soldier , moving easily in his cuirass , continued to harass them with javelins and lances , and whenever the occasion required , closed with them with his short sword , and stabbed the defenceless enemy for it is not their custom to defend themselves with a shield
 but their mainstay , it was thought , was faenius rufus , the commander of the guard , a man of esteemed life and character , to whom tigellinus with his brutality and shamelessness was superior in the emperor's regard he harassed him with calumnies , and had often put him in terror by hinting that he had been agrippina's paramour , and from sorrow at her loss was intent on vengeance
 he stooped to wiles and to entreaties , to anything indeed by which he might allure the wavering and confirm the willing
 meanwhile the soldiers , as their numbers overflowed the crowded camp , dispersed throughout the porticoes , the temples , and the whole capital , did not know their own headquarters , kept no watch , and ceased to brace themselves by toil
 they had men , arms and horses , more than enough for all purposes of utility and show , but before the war they had been acquainted only with the companies and squadrons of their own force , as the various armies were separated from each other by the limits of their respective provinces
 when after the destruction of brutus and cassius there was no longer any army of the commonwealth , when pompeius was crushed in sicily , and when , with lepidus pushed aside and antonius slain , even the julian faction had only caesar left to lead it , then , dropping the title of triumvir , and giving out that he was a consul , and was satisfied with a tribune's authority for the protection of the people , augustus won over the soldiers with gifts , the populace with cheap corn , and all men with the sweets of repose , and so grew greater by degrees , while he concentrated in himself the functions of the senate , the magistrates , and the laws he was wholly unopposed , for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle , or in the proscription , while the remaining nobles , the readier they were to be slaves , were raised the higher by wealth and promotion , so that , aggrandised by revolution , they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past
 otho did not treat him as a man to be pardoned , and , unwilling to blend with the grace of reconciliation the memory of past hostility , at once admitted him to his intimate friendship , and soon afterwards appointed him to be one of his generals by some fatality , as it seemed , celsus maintained also to otho a fidelity as irreproachable as it was unfortunate
 all his forces , whose number amounted to three veteran legions , and one of recruits , and about eight hundred horse being landed , antony sent most of his ships back to italy , to transport the remainder of the soldiers and horse the pontons , which are a sort of gallic ships , he left at lissus with this object , that if pompey , imagining italy defenseless , should transport his army thither and this notion was spread among the common people , caesar might have some means of pursuing him ; and he sent messengers to him with great dispatch , to inform him in what part of the country he had landed his army , and what number of troops he had brought over with him . 
 a thousand troopers , tiridates said , would be his escort
 and as it is the way with a mob to fix any charge , however groundless , on some particular person , they reproached manatius plancus , an ex-consul and the chief envoy , with being the author of the senate's decree
 not less revolting was that portion of the road which the people of cremona had strewed with laurel leaves and roses , and on which they had raised altars , and sacrificed victims as if to greet some barbarous despot , festivities in which they delighted for the moment , but which were afterwards to work their ruin
 whether he there had provoked the young prince by wilful opposition and rivalry , and had rejoiced at his death or wickedly destroyed him , is for you to determine with minds unbiassed
 to these they add several smaller vessels , that our fleet might be terrified by numbers ; they man them with a great number of archers and of the albici , of whom mention has been already made , and these they incited by rewards and promises . 
 it was next decided to punish the remaining children of sejanus , though the fury of the populace was subsiding , and people generally had been appeased by the previous executions
 he himself , with a larger army , invaded the marsi , whose leader , mallovendus , whom we had lately admitted to surrender , pointed out a neighbouring wood , where , he said , an eagle of one of varus's legions was buried and guarded only by a small force
 civilis , bent on winning gaul and germany if his purposes should prosper , was on the point of securing supremacy over the most powerful and most wealthy of the states
 i find it stated by some authors that either the dread of or the disgust felt for both emperors , whose wickedness and infamy were coming out every day into more open notoriety , made the two armies hesitate whether they should not cease their strife , and either themselves consult together , or allow the senate to choose an emperor and that , for this reason , otho's generals recommended a certain measure of delay , paullinus especially entertaining hopes for himself , on the ground that he was the senior among the men of consular rank , that he was well known as a soldier , and had attained great distinction and fame by his campaigns in britain
in the mean time caesar's legates , quintus titurius and lucius cotta , who had led the legions into the territories of the menapii , having laid waste all their lands , cut down their corn and burned their houses , returned to caesar because the menapii had all concealed themselves in their thickest woods .
 his grandfather had fallen in the battle of pharsalia , fighting for the aristocracy
 tiberius having gently expressed disapproval of his dress and manners , pronounced a very sharp censure on his visit to alexandria without the emperor's leave , contrary to the regulations of augustus
 the country , ready to find a meaning in every circumstance , regarded it as an omen of gloomy import that vitellius , on obtaining the office of supreme pontiff , should have issued a proclamation concerning the public religious ceremonial on the 18th of july , a day which from old times the disasters of cremera and allia had marked as unlucky
 such was the end of the rebellion of the treveri
caesar , suspecting that which was , —that some new enterprise was undertaken by the barbarians , ordered the two cohorts which were on duty , to march into that quarter with him , and two other cohorts to relieve them on duty ; the rest to be armed and follow him immediately .
 rumour said that he supported that lonely exile by a life of ease and plenty when the accusers attacked his son nerullinus on the strength of men's hatred of the father and of some charges of extortion , the emperor interposed , as if implying that vengeange was fully satisfied
 he even expressed a wish to be saluted as caesar , a title which he had formerly rejected but now he had a superstitious feeling about the name
during the short part of summer which remained , caesar , although in these countries , as all gaul lies toward the north , the winters are early , nevertheless resolved to proceed into britain , because he discovered that in almost all the wars with the gauls succors had been furnished to our enemy from that country ; and even if the time of year should be insufficient for carrying on the war , yet he thought it would be of great service to him if he only entered the island , and saw into the character of the people , and got knowledge of their localities , harbors , and landing-places , all which were for the most part unknown to the gauls .
having left two legions and the luggage of the entire army at agendicum , he marches to the boii .
 but there was no order , or regular discipline , as every one followed his own humor , and all traveled without apprehension , taking the same liberty as on former marches . 
 german independence truly is fiercer than the despotism of an arsaces
 curio , surprised at the suddenness of the affair , sent on the horse to receive their first charge , and detain them . 
 when , however , the enemy saw that we again pursued them in firm and compact array , they fled no longer in masses as before , each looking for his comrade
when they saw no one descending to the level ground , and the enemy extending themselves along the entire wall in every direction , fearing lest every hope of flight should be cut off , they cast away their arms , and sought , without stopping , the most remote parts of the town .
 the bructeri , tubantes , and usipetes , were roused by this slaughter , and they beset the forest passes through which the army had to return
 there was a rumour that sabrius flavus had held a secret consultation with the centurions , and had planned , not without seneca's knowledge , that when nero had been slain by piso's instrumentality , piso also was to be murdered , and the empire handed over to seneca , as a man singled out for his splendid virtues by all persons of integrity
 the battle extended over a long line of march , lasting with varying success till night parted the combatants
 the motive for equipping this fleet was , to say nothing of the natural vanity of this people , a desire to intercept , by this alarming demonstration , the supplies that were approaching from gaul
 corbulo heard of this with displeasure he sharply censured paccius , the officers and soldiers , and ordered them to have their quarters outside the lines
in the mean time , indutiomarus , with all his cavalry , nearly every day used to parade close to his camp ; at one time , that he might inform himself of the situation of the camp ; at another time , for the purpose of conferring with or of intimidating him .
 vocula added to his force a thousand picked men from the fifth and fifteenth legions besieged in the old camp , a body of troops undisciplined and ill-affected to their officers
 about the same time an embassy from the parthians , which had been sent , as i have stated , to solicit the return of meherdates , was introduced into the senate , and delivered a message to the following effect 
 i foresee your possible answer
the ships having been brought up on shore and the camp strongly fortified , he left the same forces as he did before as a guard for the ships ; he sets out in person for the same place that he had returned from .
 once too when caius caesar in a casual conversation ridiculed lucius sulla , he predicted to him that he would have all sulla's vices and none of his virtues
 galba had entrusted the government of galatia and pamphylia to calpurnius asprenas
 others were denounced by friends everywhere were lamentations , and wailings , and all the miseries of a captured city , till the license of the vitellianist and othonianist soldiery , once so odious , was remembered with regret
 the more hope you hold out to me , should i choose to live , the more glorious will be my death
 valens retorted with charges of emptiness and vanity but concealing their enmity , they devoted themselves to their common interest , and in frequent letters , without any thought of pardon , heaped all manner of charges upon otho , while the othonianist generals , though they had the most abundant materials for invective against vitellius , refrained from employing them
 for they never foresaw the very improbable contingency of his voluntary exile from his home for eleven years
 in otho's army the generals were full of fear , and the soldiers hated their officers
 but the ocean barred the explorer's access to itself and to hercules
caesar , after he came from the territories of the menapii into those of the treviri , resolved for two reasons to cross the rhine ; one of which was , because they had sent assistance to the treviri against him ; the other , that ambiorix might not have a retreat among them .
 now began a series of skirmishes , for the most part like raids , in woods and morasses , with encounters due to chance or to courage , to mere heedlessness or to calculation , to fury or to lust of plunder , under directions from the officers , or sometimes even without their knowledge
 boiocalus spurned the offer as the price of treason , adding , we may lack a land to live in
 was it to be thought a worse offence to obtain a reward for honest service with the litigant's consent , than to pollute the chambers of the imperial ladies
among the helvetii , orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and wealthy .
 by degrees they fell to bitter words , and even the river between them would not have hindered them from joining combat , had not stertinius hurried up and put his hand on flavus , who in the full tide of his fury was demanding his weapons and his charger
 the stones and spears penetrated their host at a range beyond the reach of the opposing volleys of arrows the bridge was then completed , and the hills facing us were occupied by our auxiliary infantry , then , by the entrenchments of the legions , with such rapidity and such a display of force that the parthians , giving up their preparations for the invasion of syria , concentrated all their hopes on armenia
 and now , late in the day , he withdrew one of his legions from the field , to intrench a camp , while the rest till nightfall glutted themselves with the enemy's blood
 how few were left who had seen the republic ! 
 never , it is said , was the emperor so exasperated by an insult to himself and the roman people as by a deserter and brigand assuming the character of a belligerent
 i have not been sent , but have come back to you
 it was determined to seize the opportunity of attacking this force , unprepared as it was
 for piso , the last rites were performed by his wife verania and his brother scribonianus for vinius , by his daughter crispina , their heads having been discovered and purchased from the murderers , who had reserved them for sale
 nero will always be regretted by the thoroughly depraved
he proposed a reward for those who should first scale the walls , and gave the signal to the soldiers .
caesar doubled the number of hostages which he had before demanded ; and ordered that they should be brought over to the continent , because , since the time of the equinox was near , he did not consider that , with his ships out of repair , the voyage ought to be deferred till winter .
 or possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle , and there may be moral revolutions just as there are changes of seasons
 it happened at this time that a perilous accident which occurred to the emperor strengthened vague rumours and gave him grounds for trusting more fully in the friendship and fidelity of sejanus
after arranging these things , as he considered it certain that ambiorix would not contend in battle , he watched his other plans attentively .
 how much more gloriously will you die while you cling to the state and invoke aid for liberty rather let the soldiers fail , the people be traitors , provided that you , if prematurely robbed of life , justify your death to your ancestors and descendants
 the centurions of the one , the slaves of the other , combine violence with insult
 marius celsus , consul elect , whom he had rescued from the fury of the soldiers by pretending to imprison him , he now ordered to be summoned to the capitol
 then offerings and thanksgivings to the gods were decreed , with special honours to the sun , who has an ancient temple in the circus where the crime was planned , as having revealed by his power the secrets of the conspiracy
 for germans , they have much intelligence and sagacity
 himself an exile , he was the companion of a proscribed father , and on being admitted as a stepson into the house of augustus , he had to struggle with many rivals , so long as marcellus and agrippa and , subsequently , caius and lucius caesar were in their glory
 little care , however , was taken about the conveyance of supplies into the camp
 men's minds were so intent on the civil war , that foreign affairs were disregarded
 these pompey considered his steadiest troops . 
 to cilo and aquila were voted , respectively , the consular and praetorian decorations
 the cavalry were sent on to aricia , the main body of the legions halted on this side of bovillae
 thence arose such a panic , from the belief that the germans had burst into the camp , that all rushed to the gates of these the decuman gate was the point chiefly sought , as it was furthest from the enemy and safer for flight
 it was less of a secret that there was a design to murder plautus , as his life was dear to many the distance too by land and sea , and the interval of time , had given rise to rumours , and the popular story was that he had tampered with corbulo , who was then at the head of great armies , and would be a special mark for danger , if illustrious and innocent men were to be destroyed
 the entire army of vitellius , he said , has already arrived nor have they much strength in their rear , since gaul is ready to rise , and to abandon the banks of the rhine , when such hostile tribes are ready to burst in , would not answer his purpose
 as he yet hesitated , various disasters , pestilence , and the unmistakable anger of heaven , which grew heavier from day to day , continued to harass him
 at the same time , showers of darts , thrown from a distance from the lesser ships , suddenly inflicted several wounds on our men when off their guard and otherwise engaged ; and two of their three-decked galleys ; having descried the ship of decimus brutus , which could be easily distinguished by its flag , rowed up against him with great violence from opposite sides : but brutus , seeing into their designs , by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with such address as to get clear , though only by a moment . 
 the latter possessed at first a great fortune , still unimpaired , and was subsequently deprived of it , both which circumstances enhanced her fame
when caesar observed this , he ordered the ships of war , the appearance of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the motion more ready for service , to be withdrawn a little from the transport vessels , and to be propelled by their oars , and be stationed toward the open flank of the enemy , and the enemy to be beaten off and driven away , with slings , arrows , and engines : which plan was of great service to our men ; for the barbarians being startled by the form of our ships and the motions of our oars and the nature of our engines , which was strange to them , stopped , and shortly after retreated a little .
 at rome , meanwhile , when the result of affairs in illyrium was not yet known , and men had heard of the commotion among the german legions , the citizens in alarm reproached tiberius for the hypocritical irresolution with which he was befooling the senate and the people , feeble and disarmed as they were , while the soldiery were all the time in revolt , and could not be quelled by the yet imperfectly-matured authority of two striplings
 in an instant corbulo backed up his advice by a menacing attitude he drove from their possessions the nobles of armenia , who had been the first to revolt from us , destroyed their fortresses , and spread equal panic throughout the plain and the hill country , among the strong and among the weak
 nero's reply was substantially this 
 so strong , however , was the influence of cluvius , that vitellius actually ordered the freedman to be punished
 envoys were sent to parthia and armenia , and precautions were taken that , when the legions were engaged in the civil war , the country in their rear might not be exposed to attack
 the first and the twelfth , the sole strength of the othonianist army , are not there , and even them we routed and crushed on these very plains , only that so many thousands of armed men , like a herd of slaves for sale , might be given as a present to the exile antonius
 at the same time they were on the point of destroying the forts , but the prefects of the cohorts , seeing that they could not hold them , set them on fire
labienus , having learned the death of sabinus and the destruction of the cohorts , as all the forces of the treviri had come against him , beginning to fear lest , if he made a departure from his winter-quarters , resembling a flight , he should not be able to support the attack of the enemy , particularly since he knew them to be elated by their recent victory , sends back a letter to caesar , informing him with what great hazard he would lead out his legion from winter-quarters ; he relates at large the affairs which had taken place among the eburones ; he informs him that all the infantry and cavalry of the treviri had encamped at a distance of only three miles from his own camp .
caesar , having selected a commanding situation , sees distinctly whatever is going on in every quarter , and sends assistance to his troops when hard pressed .
being greatly alarmed at these things , caesar thought that he ought to use all dispatch , lest , if this new band of suevi should unite with the old troops of ariovistus , he might be less easily withstood .
 and it is a fact that in the moment of terror the counsels of the wise and the voice of the rabble are listened to with equal respect but as all movements that originate in thoughtless impulse , however vigorous in their beginnings , become feeble after a time , the throng of senators and knights gradually melted away , dispersing at first tardily and during the absence of the emperor , but before long with a contemptuous indifference to his presence , till , ashamed of the failure of his efforts , vitellius waived his claims to services which were not offered
 tiber himself would be altogether unwilling to be deprived of his neighbour streams and to flow with less glory
 both sides fought with great courage and resolution ; nor did the albici , a hardy people , bred on the highlands and inured to arms , fall much short of our men in valor : and being lately come from the massilians , they retained in their minds their recent promises : and the wild shepherds , encouraged by the hope of liberty , were eager to prove their zeal in the presence of their masters . 
 , it is my words , senators , which are condemned , so innocent am i of any guilty act
 being inferior to his rival in influence with vitellius , he should seek to secure favour and power with the new emperor
 in another quarter , blaesus's son led a separate force of his own , to save the villages of cirta from being ravaged with impunity between the two was the general himself with some picked troops by establishing redoubts and fortified lines in commanding positions , he had rendered the whole country embarrassing and perilous to the foe , for , whichever way he turned , a body of roman soldiers was in his face , or on his flank , or frequently in the rear
 there they took counsel how to heal matters
 that having agreed on the design they had sent notice to gallonius , to quit gades of his own accord while he could do it with safety ; if he did not , they would take measures for themselves ; that for fear of this gallonius had been induced to quit the town . 
 and so thither plautus retired with his wife antistia and a few intimate friends
in the mean time the barbarians dispatched messengers to all parts , and reported to their people the small number of our soldiers , and how good an opportunity was given for obtaining spoil and for liberating themselves forever , if they should only drive the romans from their camp .
 but an alarm greater than all , because it connected immediate loss with fears for the future , arose from a sudden inundation of the tiber the river became vastly swollen , broke down the wooden bridge , was checked by the heap of ruins across the current , and overflowed not only the low and level districts of the capital , but also much that had been thought safe from such casualties
 he also offered rewards proportioned to each person's position and property , and prescribed a period within which they were to obtain them on the completion of so many houses or blocks of building
 afranius and petreius , when pay was demanded by the legions , a sedition almost breaking out , asserted that the time had not yet come , and required that caesar should take cognizance of it ; and both parties were content with his decision . 
 after a short delay hordeonius gave the donative in the name of vespasian this , more than anything else , fostered the mutinous spirit
 some there were who , as they thought of his beauty , his age , and the manner of his death , the vicinity too of the country where he died , likened his end to that of alexander the great
 successful as was this settlement of all the interests of our allies , it gave germanicus little joy because of the arrogance of piso though he had been ordered to march part of the legions into armenia under his own or his son's command , he had neglected to do either at length the two met at cyrrhus , the winterquarters of the tenth legion , each controlling his looks , piso concealing his fears , germanicus shunning the semblance of menace
 here is a stronger proof of the greater importance of the cases tried before these judges than in the fact that causes in the court of the hundred , causes which now hold the first place , were then so eclipsed by the fame of other trials that not a speech of cicero , or cæsar , or brutus , or caelius , or calvus , or , in short , any great orator is now read , that was delivered in that court , except only the orations of asinius pollio for the heirs of urbinia , as they are entitled , and even pollio delivered these in the middle of the reign of augustus , a period of long rest , of unbroken repose for the people and tranquillity for the senate , when the emperor's perfect discipline had put its restraints on eloquence as well as on all else
 he is the only man who cares not for your safety , honours not your accomplishments
 by this time stertinius , who had been despatched to receive the surrender of segimerus , brother of segestes , had conducted the chief , together with his son , to the canton of the ubii
that is the name of a fort .
he informed him too , how old and how just were the grounds of connection that existed between themselves and the aedui , what decrees of the senate had been passed in their favor , and how frequent and how honorable ; how from time immemorial the aedui had held the supremacy of the whole of gaul ; even before they had sought our friendship ; that it was the custom of the roman people to desire not only that its allies and friends should lose none of their property , but be advanced in influence , dignity , and honor : who then could endure that what they had brought with them to the friendship of the roman people should be torn from them ? he then made the same demands which he had commissioned the embassadors to make , that should not make war either upon the aedui or their allies , that he should restore the hostages ; that if he could not send back to their country any part of the germans , he should at all events suffer none of them any more to cross the rhine .
 but , after a while , sloth following on ease crept over them , and they lost their courage along with their freedom
 a cup as yet harmless , but extremely hot and already tasted , was handed to britannicus
when our men had speedily taken up arms and had ascended the rampart , and sending out some spanish horse on one side , had proved conquerors in a cavalry action , the enemy , despairing of success , drew off their troops from the assault .
 whose name does the father din into his children's ears before that of the orator
there was together with the others , dumnorix , the aeduan , of whom we have made previous mention .
caesar said that on account of his respect for diviciacus and the aeduans , he would receive them into his protection , and would spare them ; but , because the state was of great influence among the belgae , and pre-eminent in the number of its population , he demanded 600 hostages .
 then , the cilicians turned their backs and shut themselves up within the fortress
 none enjoyed greater glory , or honours more august , first with the gods , whose answers they published , and at whose feasts they were present , as was commonly said , and then with the offspring of the gods and with sacred kings , among whom , so we have understood , was not a single pleader of causes , but an orpheus , a linus , and , if you care to dive into a remoter age , an apollo himself
when they came to the river loire , which separates the bituriges from the aedui , they delayed a few days there , and , not daring to pass the river , return home , and send back word to the lieutenants that they had returned through fear of the treachery of the bituriges , who , they ascertained , had formed this design , that if the aedui should cross the river , the bituriges on the one side , and the arverni on the other , should surround them .
 he formally thanked fonteius agrippa and domitius pollio for offering their daughters and so vying with one another in zeal for the commonwealth
when he arrived there , he encourages the timid and stations garrisons among the ruteni , in the province of the volcae arecomici , and the country around narbo which was in the vicinity of the enemy ; he orders a portion of the forces from the province , and the recruits which he had brought from italy , to rendezvous among the helvii who border on the territories of the arverni .
 these things being completed , he ordered his legions to file off : pompey's men insultingly and boldly pursued and chased us , leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in the front of our works , in order to pass over the trench . 
 the same summer a usipian cohort , which had been levied in germany and transported into britain , ventured on a great and memorable exploit
 vespasian himself went everywhere , urged to exertion , encouraged the industrious by praise , and with the indolent used the stimulus of example rather than of compulsion , and chose to be blind to the faults rather than to the merits of his friends
 the army was then moved from bonna to the colonia agrippinensis , while auxiliaries from gaul continued to flow in
 when this was known , the prisoners were secretly ransomed by their friends and relatives
 messalina , now grown weary of the very facility of her adulteries , was rushing into strange excesses , when even silius , either through some fatal infatuation or because he imagined that , amid the dangers which hung over him , danger itself was the best safety , urged the breaking off of all concealment
 they advanced to the third milestone , and gathered the dispersed and panic-stricken vitellianists round their proper standards
 to give ground , provided you return to the attack , is considered prudence rather than cowardice
 the rest were thrown into prison not one of them uttered an unworthy word even in disaster the honour of the soldier was preserved
 it was by war and its perils they had earned them
 they yet retain the honourable badge of an ancient alliance
 the address of the tribunes was thus abruptly terminated thus it remained uncertain whether deception , or treason , or some honourable arrangement , had been in their thoughts
 she said , too , that , if the perversity of such malignant suggestions were not checked , it would issue in the ruin of the state
the battle was vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening .
 he then came to elephantine and syene , formerly the limits of the roman empire , which now extends to the red sea
 the conspirators' names , however , she withheld
 the people , who had been collected after diligent search , finding themselves left in a desert , sat for the most part in a stupor of grief , till one of the exiles , moyses by name , warned them not to look for any relief from god or man , forsaken as they were of both , but to trust to themselves , taking for their heaven-sent leader that man who should first help them to be quit of their present misery
 some were at once dropped , or became obsolete with time
 they are followed by the tarraconenses , jacetani , and ausetani , and in a few days more by the illurgavonenses , who dwell near the river ebro . 
 the praetorians opposed them by rolling down with a tremendous crash ponderous masses of rock , placed for the purpose
the leading men of gaul , having convened councils among themselves in the woods , and retired places , complain of the death of acco : they point out that this fate may fall in turn on themselves : they bewail the unhappy fate of gaul ; and by every sort of promises and rewards , they earnestly solicit some to begin the war , and assert the freedom of gaul at the hazard of their lives .
 the emperor consoled his daughter , passed over though she was , with a dowry of a million sesterces
 all senators are competent to pay their homage
 the arms of the dead man and in some cases his horse are consigned to the fire
 it was cneius pompeius who , in his third consulship , first restricted all this , and put a bridle , so to say , on eloquence , intending , however , that all business should be transacted in the forum according to law , and before the prætors
 vitellius , having first put forward these arguments in a conciliatory speech , and met with decided acquiescence from the senate , began afresh to point out , that , as they all recommended the emperor's marriage , they ought to select a lady conspicuous for noble rank and purity , herself too the mother of children
 again his brother drusus enjoyed in a greater degree the affection of the citizens
but almost in the middle of the hill , the gauls had previously built a wall six feet high , made of large stones , and extending in length as far as the nature of the ground permitted , as a barrier to retard the advance of our men ; and leaving all the lower space empty , they had filled the upper part of the hill , as far as the wall of the town , with their camps very close to one another .
 bassus indeed dug up his land and extensive plains in the neighbourhood , while he persisted that this or that was the place of the promised cave , and was followed not only by our soldiers but by the rustic population who were engaged to execute the work , till at last he threw off his infatuation , and expressing wonder that his dreams had never before been false , and that now for the first time he had been deluded , he escaped disgrace and danger by a voluntary death
 the emperor at once sent staius , a tribune , with a strong detachment , by whom the ringleader himself , with his most daring followers , were brought prisoners to rome where men already trembled at the vast scale of the slave-establishments , in which there was an immense growth , while the freeborn populace daily decreased
 pharasmanes had been long in possession of iberia , and his brother , mithridates , ruled armenia with our powerful support
 no sooner did the batavians begin to close with the enemy , to strike them with their shields , to disfigure their faces , and overthrowing the force on the plain to advance their line up the hill , than the other auxiliary cohorts joined with eager rivalry in cutting down all the nearest of the foe
 and so died tiberius , in the seventy eighth year of his age nero was his father , and he was on both sides descended from the claudian house , though his mother passed by adoption , first into the livian , then into the julian family
 when , therefore , intelligence reached him that the cavalry of the treveri and the tungrian infantry had been defeated by otho's fleet , and that gallia narbonensis was blockaded , anxious at once to protect a friendly population , and , like a skilful soldier , to separate cohorts so turbulent and , while they remained united , so inconveniently strong , he directed a detachment of the batavians to proceed to the relief of the province
 and , as vologeses had not pressed his advantage with much vigour , paetus once again , with vain confidence , posted 3000 chosen infantry on the adjacent ridge of the taurus , in order to bar the king's passage he also stationed some pannonian troopers , the flower of his cavalry , in a part of the plain
 of his own free will , as it seemed , and while still a mere youth , he had undertaken the prosecution , not to ward off any peril from himself , but in the hope of gaining power
trees serve as beds to them ; they lean themselves against them , and thus reclining only slightly , they take their rest ; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves , they either undermine all the trees at the roots , or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be left standing .
 but caecina thoroughly cowed them , carrying his arms everywhere , and the marsi who ventured to engage him , he repulsed in a successful battle
 while they were sacrificing , the one , after roman custom , offering a swine , a ram and a bull the other , a horse which he had duly prepared as a propitiation to the river-god , they were informed by the neighbouring inhabitants that the euphrates , without any violent rains , was of itself rising to an immense height , and that the white foam was curling into circles like a diadem , an omen of a prosperous passage
 quadratus , however , exhibited felix as one of the judges , admitting him to the bench with the view of cowing the ardour of the prosecutors
 inguiomerus , with fiercer counsels , heartily welcome to barbarians , was for beleaguering the entrenchment in armed array , as to storm them would , he said , be easy , and there would be more prisoners and the booty unspoilt
 but they completed their works first ; both because they had a greater number of men , and because they had a smaller compass to inclose . 
caesar , having removed out of sight first his own horse , then those of all , that he might make the danger of all equal , and do away with the hope of flight , after encouraging his men , joined battle .
 we neither want a defence of the ancients , nor do we compare any of ourselves , though we have just heard our own praises , with those whom aper has denounced
 there were the disasters of lollius and varus , the murders at rome of the varros , egnatii , and juli
 gaul had gathered fresh courage from the belief that the fortunes of our armies had been everywhere disastrous for a report was rife that our winter camps in moesia and pannonia were hemmed in by the sarmatians and dacians
 these were the victims slain to sejanus wherever he turned his eyes , wherever his words fell , there was flight and solitude
 marcellus was saved from punishment rather than from disgrace by the memory of his ancestors and the intercessions of the emperor
 such were the various turns of fortune in the battle . 
 rome was wasted by conflagrations , its oldest temples consumed , and the capitol itself fired by the hands of citizens
 to prolong such advice , suits not this occasion , and all my purpose is fulfilled if i have made a good choice in you
 his character too had its distinct periods
accordingly , as ill success weakens the authority of other generals , so , on the contrary , his dignity increased daily , although a loss was sustained : at the same time they began to entertain hopes , on his assertion , of uniting the rest of the states to themselves , and on this occasion , for the first time , the gauls began to fortify their camps , and were so alarmed that although they were men unaccustomed to toil , yet they were of opinion that they ought to endure and suffer every thing which should be imposed upon them .
 at this place , fronting the enemy , there was a ditch fifteen feet wide , and a rampart ten feet high , and the top of the rampart was ten feet in breadth . 
 in their confusion , as they shrank back , they overturned the lamp on the table at his side , and in the darkness , now to him the gloom of death , he aimed two blows at a vital part
 the ornaments and chains of the soldiers presented a brilliant appearance
 a few of the old soldiers were left in the winter quarters , and the conscription throughout gaul was hastily proceeded with , in order that the muster rolls of the legions which remained behind might be filled up
 he was acquainted with their plans , their positions , with what met the eye , and what was hidden , and he prepared to turn the enemy's stratagems to their own destruction
 it is in no boastful spirit that i mention this , but because this duty has immemorially belonged to the college of the fifteen , and the praetors have performed the chief functions in these ceremonies
 many people liked this very licence , but they screened it under respectable names
 octavius , being informed of their determination , surrounded the town with five encampments , and began to press them at once with a siege and storm . 
 then came a lull , until on the occasion of our discords and the civil war , they stormed the winter camp of our legions , and even designed the conquest of gaul
 availing himself of the right of conquest , he entered the temple
 for hitherto i have upheld my position and my safety better by integrity than by eloquence , and i am not afraid of having ever to say a word in the senate except to avert peril from another
he orders him to fortify a camp with a rampart twelve feet in height , and a trench eighteen feet in breadth .
 this only i will declare , that nothing is too grand to be deserved by your merits and your goodwill towards me
 his kinsman , valerius fabianus , who was marked out for a career of promotion , forged a will in his name with vinicius rufinus and terentius lentinus , roman knights , for his accomplices
 celsus pleaded guilty to the charge of faithful adherence to galba , and even made a merit of such an example of fidelity
 to those who will estimate the matter aright it is evident that gaul fell by her own strength
 if no one oppose us , our march will be harmless , but if an armed force encounter us , we will make a way with the sword
 when this was refused by caesar , but a public interview offered if they chose it , afranius's son was given as a hostage to caesar . 
 it cannot , he said , be long a question that agrippina stands first in nobility of birth
 but our men , when the signal was given , rushed forward with their javelins ready to be launched , but perceiving that pompey's men did not run to meet their charge , having acquired experience by custom , and being practiced in former battles , they of their own accord repressed their speed , and halted almost midway ; that they might not come up with the enemy when their strength was exhausted , and after a short respite they again renewed their course , and threw their javelins , and instantly drew their swords , as caesar had ordered them . 
 it is as needful that the soldiers should be ignorant of some things as that they should know others
 more faults are often committed , while we are trying to oblige than while we are giving offence
 at the same time on the left wing , the entire cavalry of publius attius , and several light-armed infantry intermixed with them , were perceived descending into the valley . 
 both were pardoned , segimerus readily , the son with some hesitation , because it was said that he had insulted the corpse of quintilius varus
 he begged vespasian that he would deign to moisten his cheeks and eye-balls with his spittle
 but nasidius's ships were of no use , and soon left the fight ; for the sight of their country , or the entreaties of their relations , did not urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives . 
 caesar first accomplished the march , and having found a plain behind large rocks , drew up his army there in order of battle and facing the enemy . 
 and so the roman army now on the spot , six years after the disaster , in grief and anger , began to bury the bones of the three legions , not a soldier knowing whether he was interring the relics of a relative or a stranger , but looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood , while their wrath rose higher than ever against the foe
 and then , when he had filled the vain heart of the man with hope and ambition , he destroyed his power by sending into winter quarters the 7th legion , whose affection for antonius was particularly vehement
 having advanced six miles , he met the horse , heard what had happened and inquired from the captives who commanded the camp at bagrada . 
 even nero turned his eyes away , and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered
 trebellius charged him with mutinous designs , and with disturbing the regularity of military discipline caelius retorted on trebellius the accusation of having plundered and impoverished the legions meanwhile all obedience in the army was destroyed by these disgraceful quarrels between its commanders , and the feud rose to such a height that trebellius was insulted even by the auxiliaries , and finding himself altogether isolated , as the infantry and cavalry sided with caelius , he fled for safety to vitellius yet the province still enjoyed tranquility , though its consular governor had been driven from it
 then he even administered consolation to salvius cocceianus , his brother's son , a very young man , who was anxious and sorrowful , praising his affection while he rebuked his fear
 notwithstanding these remonstrances , it was the inflexible purpose of tiberius not to quit the head-quarters of empire or to imperil himself and the state
that day , quintus laberius durus , a tribune of the soldiers , was slain .
 sextus pompeius and sextus apuleius , the consuls , were the first to swear allegiance to tiberius caesar , and in their presence the oath was taken by seius strabo and caius turranius , respectively the commander of the praetorian cohorts and the superintendent of the corn supplies
 the origin of quadratus i have not ascertained
 our greatest advantage in coping with tribes so powerful is that they do not act in concert
 of this event , they declare , traces still remain , for the soil , which is scorched in appearance , has lost its productive power
 let nero be ever before your eyes , swollen with the pride of a long line of caesars it was not vindex with his unarmed province , it was not myself with my single legion , that shook his yoke from our necks
 the next day he led his army to utica , and encamped near the town before the works of the camp were finished , the horse upon guard brought him word that a large supply of horse and foot sent by king juba were on their march to utica , and at the same time a cloud of dust was observed , and in a moment the front of the line was in sight . 
 by two daring acts , one most atrocious , the other singularly noble , he earned in the eyes of posterity about an equal share of infamy and of glory i should think it unbecoming the dignity of the task which i have undertaken , to collect fabulous marvels , and to amuse with fiction the tastes of my readers at the same time i would not venture to impugn the credit of common report and tradition the natives of these parts relate that on the day when the battle was being fought at bedriacum , a bird of unfamiliar appearance settled in a much frequented grove near regium lepidum , and was not frightened or driven away by the concourse of people , or by the multitude of birds that flocked round it , until otho killed himself
as it ought not to be pardoned in him , if he were to make an attack upon our territories ; so , likewise , that we were unjust , to obstruct him in his prerogative .
 that commander , troubled at so speedy a success , and imagining that unless he occupied rome in person he should lose all share in the glory of the war , continued to write in ambiguous terms to varus and antonius , enlarging at one time on the necessity of following up their operations , at another on the advantage of delay , and with expressions so worded that he could , according to the event , repudiate a disastrous , or claim a successful policy
 the germans whom success rendered unwearied , without even then taking any rest , turned all the streams which rose from the slopes of the surrounding hills into the lands beneath the ground being thus flooded and the completed portion of our works submerged , the soldiers' labour was doubled
 their alacrity was increased by a letter from vespasian , written during the continuance of the war
 the two armies being united , caesar marched to gomphi , which is the first town of thessaly on the road from epirus now , the thessalians , a few months before , had of themselves sent embassadors to caesar , offering him the free use of every thing in their power , and requesting a garrison for their protection . 
 still the informers were punished when ever an opportunity occurred servilius and cornelius , for example , whom the destruction of scaurus had made notorious , were outlawed and transported to some islands for having taken money from varius ligur for dropping a prosecution
 the germans themselves i should regard as aboriginal , and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse
 senators , knights , a number of the city populace flocked thither , anxiously looking to sejanus , approach to whom was particularly difficult and was consequently sought by intrigue and by complicity in his counsels
and if the most ancient period was to be regarded-then was the sovereignty of the roman people in gaul most just : if the decree of the senate was to be observed , then ought gaul to be free , which they had conquered in war , and had permitted to enjoy its own laws .
 as for them , i am justly angry with their intemperate zeal for to what purpose did they strip the corpse and expose it to the pollution of the vulgar gaze , and circulate a story among foreigners that he was destroyed by poison , if all this is still doubtful and requires investigation
 under this compulsion , mithridates agreed to a day and a place for negotiation and quitted the fortress
 these men had associated with them antonius primus and asinius marcellus
 iturum ad signa et effigies principis , ubi legionibus coram regnum auspicaretur

 meanwhile corbulo kept his legions within the camp till spring weather was fairly established , and having stationed his auxiliary infantry at suitable points , he directed them not to begin an engagement
 octavius , when he ceased to be tribune , was prosecuted before the consuls by the father of the murdered woman , and was condemned by the sentence of the senate under the law concerning assassins
 such a form of oath appeared meaningless
 can we doubt that there were found critics who admired appius caecus more than cato we know that even cicero was not without his disparagers , who thought him inflated , turgid , not concise enough , but unduly diffuse and luxuriant , in short anything but attic
 he fixed on the marshes of ostia for the reception of the rubbish , and arranged that the ships which had brought up corn by the tiber , should sail down the river with cargoes of this rubbish the buildings themselves , to a certain height , were to be solidly constructed , without wooden beams , of stone from gabii or alba , that material being impervious to fire
 civilis , who now on the arrival of these veteran cohorts was at the head of a complete army , but who was undecided in his plans , and still reflected on the power of rome , made all who were with him swear allegiance to vespasian , and sent envoys to the two legions which after their defeat in the previous engagement had retreated into the old camp , advising them to accept the same allegiance
the menapii bordered on the territories of the eburones , and were protected by one continued extent of morasses and woods ; and they alone out of gaul had never sent embassadors to caesar on the subject of peace .
 she has given proof too that she is not barren , and she has suitable moral qualities
about fifteen days after they had come into winter-quarters , the beginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arose from ambiorix and catuvolcus , who , though they had met with sabinus and cotta at the borders of their kingdom , and had conveyed corn into our winter-quarters , induced by the messages of indutiomarus , one of the treveri , excited their people , and after having suddenly assailed the soldiers engaged in procuring wood , came with a large body to attack the camp .
 silius , on the one hand , though confident hope took away any need for encouragement , exclaimed again and again that it was a shame to the conquerors of germany to have to be led against gauls , as against an enemy
 this method , however , alarmed our men , who were not used to such a description of warfare for they imagined that they were about to be surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who ran forward from their ranks ; and they thought it their duty to keep their ranks , and not to quit their colors , nor , without good reason to give up the post which they had taken . 
 all who enter upon schemes involving great interests , should consider whether what they are attempting be for the advantage of the state , for their own credit , easy of accomplishment , or at any rate free from serious difficulty
 then , the conspirators present setting the example , and the rest being paralysed by the strangeness of the proceeding , he made them swear allegiance to vespasian
 when however they began to throw off equality , and ambition and violence usurped the place of self-control and modesty , despotisms grew up and became perpetual among many nations
having got possession of the hostages whom caesar had deposited with them , they terrify the hesitating by putting them to death .
 accordingly the people of lugdunum began to work on the passions of individual soldiers , and to goad them into destroying vienna , by reminding them , how that people had besieged their colony , had abetted the attempts of vindex , and had recently raised legions for galba
 over the tiles hides are spread , to prevent the water let in on them by spouts from dissolving the cement of the bricks . 
 suilius then sheltered himself under messalina's orders , and the defence began to collapse
 it is as well that i should trace the causes of this change
 in his return he attempted to see the sacred mysteries of the samothracians , but north winds which he encountered drove him aside from his course
 caesar , having moved forward from auximum , traversed the whole country of picenum . 
 the long train of prisoners , closely guarded by armed men , passed through the capital not one of them wore the look of a suppliant sullen and savage , they were unmoved by the shouts and jests of the insulting rabble
 and when he had advanced from this place about sixteen miles , his army being exhausted with the fatigue , he halted . 
to this was added , that they never fought in close order , but in small parties and at great distances , and had detachments placed , and then the one relieved the other , and the vigorous and fresh succeeded the wearied .
 of the many laws devised by our ancestors , of the many passed by the divine augustus , the first have been forgotten , while his all the more to our disgrace have become obsolete through contempt , and this has made luxury bolder than ever
 but in the government of provinces he acted with the virtue of ancient times
 but as he subsequently lost a few vessels on the shore with the crews , he was ordered , as though the war continued , to hand over his army to petronius turpilianus , who had just resigned his consulship
 that for himself , inasmuch as he would have opposed severity in the sentence , he would not be an obstacle to leniency
 their tall stature and very long spears enabled them , without closing , to wound our men , who were wavering and unsteady
 owing , however , to the vast distances , the advice came only after the matter was decided
 if unknown nations and an untried enemy confronted you , i should urge you on by the example of other armies
 consequently , to get rid of the report , nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations , called christians by the populace
 pompey , brutus , cassius , and antony , all of whom had been followed across the sea by civil war , had met with a disastrous end , and the emperors had been oftener heard of than seen in syria and judaea
caesar , as he perceived that the enemy were superior in cavalry , and he himself could receive no aid from the province or italy , while all communication was cut off , sends across the rhine into germany to those states which he had subdued in the preceding campaigns , and summons from them cavalry and the light-armed infantry , who were accustomed to engage among them .
 yet there was a panic at rome , as the soldiers pressed on in all directions
 you on the other hand have surrounded me with vast influence and boundless wealth , so that i often think within myself , am i , who am but of an equestrian and provincial family , numbered among the chief men of rome
 archers from the rutheni , and horse from the gauls , with a long train of baggage , according to the gallic custom of traveling , had arrived there ; there were besides about six thousand people of all descriptions , with slaves and freed men . 
 corbulo threw the iberians on them , ravaged their country and punished the enemy's daring at the cost of the blood of the foreigner
 the boy used to accompany and attend him , and be present at all his speeches , alike in the law-court and the assembly , and thus he picked up the art of repartee , and became habituated to the strife of words , and indeed , i may almost say , learnt how to fight in battle
 in all other respects man and wife share alike , and this arrangement involves no trouble in peace
 about the same time , from the same causes , the legions of germany rose in mutiny , with a fury proportioned to their greater numbers , in the confident hope that germanicus caesar would not be able to endure another's supremacy and offer himself to the legions , whose strength would carry everything before it
 many things are accomplished on trial which cowards think arduous
 he at once pounced on the accused , went to the consuls , and demanded an inquiry before the senate
 meanwhile , from a trifling cause , whence nothing was apprehended , there arose a tumult , which had nearly proved fatal to the capital
the aedui , by the advice of the lieutenants whom caesar had left with the army , send supplies of horse and foot to succor the bituriges .
 the title of father of the country had , he argued , been indiscriminately bestowed
 still , there was a latent dread when they remembered how unfortunate in the case of drusus , his father , had been the favour of the crowd how his uncle marcellus , regarded by the city populace with passionate enthusiasm , had been snatched from them while yet a youth , and how short-lived and ill-starred were the attachments of the roman people
