 the strictness of the discipline tended to form in each case a pure and virtuous nature which no vices could warp , and which would at once with the whole heart seize on every noble lesson whatever its bias , whether to the soldier's or the lawyer's art , or to the study of eloquence , it would make that its sole aim , and imbibe it in its fullness

 laco , prefect of the city , who had been ostensibly banished to an island , was assassinated by an enrolled pensioner , sent on by otho to do the deed
he orders ships from all parts of the neighboring countries , and the fleet which the preceding summer he had built for the war with the veneti , to assemble in this place .
 on the appointed day , arriving first , he posted his allied infantry with the king's auxiliaries on the wings , the sixth legion in the centre , with which he had united three thousand men of the third , brought up in the night from another camp , with one eagle , so as to look like a single legion
 he now even prompted to crime , to which from such wishes it is easy to pass whether indeed these thoughts of crime were suddenly conceived , is doubtful otho had long been courting the affections of the soldiery , either in the hope of succeeding to the throne , or in preparation for some desperate act on the march , on parade , and in their quarters , he would address all the oldest soldiers by name , and in allusion to the progresses of nero would call them his messmates some he would recognise , he would inquire after others , and would help them with his money and interest he would often intersperse his conversation with complaints and insinuations against galba and anything else that might excite the vulgar mind laborious marches , a scanty commissariat , and the rigour of military discipline , were especially distasteful , when men , accustomed to sail to the lakes of campania and the cities of greece , had painfully to struggle under the weight of their arms over the pyrenees , the alps , and vast distances of road
 this had been of old an unsettled country from the character of its people and from its geographical position , bordering , as it does , to a great extent on our provinces and stretching far away to media

 cities in campania's richest plains were swallowed up and overwhelmed
 at last , with the light of day , when the general and the soldiers and the whole affair were clearly recognised , germanicus entered the camp , ordered plancus to be conducted to him , and received him on the tribunal
 inter quae veris principio legati parthorum mandata regis vologaesis litterasque in eandem formam attulere 
when that work was finished , he distributes garrisons , and closely fortifies redoubts , in order that he may the more easily intercept them , if they should attempt to cross over against his will .
 what again from the speeches of caelius do we admire
 the bodies of their slain they carry off even in indecisive engagements

 pompey , in like manner , having completed the same day's march , took post in his old camp at asparagium ; and his soldiers , as they had no work the fortifications being entire , made long excursions , some to collect wood and forage ; others , invited by the nearness of the former camp , laid up their arms in their tents , and quitted the intrenchments in order to bring what they had left behind them , because the design of marching being adopted in a hurry , they had left a considerable part of their wagons and luggage behind . 
 their revulsion to delight was just that of a mob , always extreme in either emotion they greeted him with praises and congratulations , and surrounding him with the eagles and standards , carried him to the tribunal
 they kept no watch they did not strengthen the weak points of the fortifications
 nor did that part of gaul which borders on the rhine fail to espouse the same cause , and to the bitterest hostility in inflaming the army against the galbianists , that being the name , which in their contempt for vindex they had given to the party

caesar , having remained in their territories a few days , and burned all their villages and houses , and cut down their corn , proceeded into the territories of the ubii ; and having promised them his assistance , if they were ever harassed by the suevi , he learned from them these particulars : that the suevi , after they had by means of their scouts found that the bridge was being built , had called a council , according to their custom , and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the towns and convey their children , wives , and all their possessions into the woods , and that all who could bear arms should assemble in one place ; that the place thus chosen was nearly the centre of those regions which the suevi possessed ; that in this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of the romans , and give them battle there .
the leaders of the enemy , having reconnoitered the country by their scouts , select from the entire army sixty thousand men , belonging to those states , which bear the highest character for courage ; they privately arrange among themselves what they wished to be done , and in what manner ; they decide that the attack should take place when it should seem to be noon .
 but so suddenly did he come on the chatti that all the helpless from age or sex were at once captured or slaughtered
 conspicuous above all in stubborn resistance were the silures , whose rage was fired by words rumoured to have been spoken by the roman general , to the effect , that as the sugambri had been formerly destroyed or transplanted into gaul , so the name of the silures ought to be blotted out
 expelled by the fickle populace , and regaining their throne by force of arms , these princes , while they ventured on the wholesale banishment of their subjects , on the destruction of cities , on the murder of brothers , wives , and parents , and the other usual atrocities of despots , fostered the national superstition by appropriating the dignity of the priesthood as the support of their political power

 corbulo too , as tiridates was entering the armenian frontier through media , sent on verulanus , his lieutenant-general with the auxiliaries , while he himself followed with the legions by forced marches , and compelled him to retreat to a distance and abandon the idea of war
 the inhabitants are healthy and able to bear fatigue
 all this , not indeed with any graciousness , but in a blunt fashion which often alarmed , he still kept up , until the death of drusus changed everything while he lived , the system continued , because sejanus , as yet only in the beginning of his power , wished to be known as an upright counsellor , and there was one whose vengeance he dreaded , who did not conceal his hatred and incessantly complained that a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive
 he delayed only while he was raising auxiliaries in scythia , and then pushed on in haste , thus anticipating the plots of enemies and the fickleness of friends
 hence it seemed the more amazing that one who knew better things and the glory which waits on mercy , should prefer harsher courses
 besides these , there were two thousand horse , who had acquired the skill of veterans by being in several wars in alexandria . 
 what need of voluntary prosecutions , when crimes are so rare and slight , or of defences full of spiteful insinuation and exceeding proper bounds , when the clemency of the judge offers itself to the accused in his peril
at last cotta , being overruled , yields his assent ; the opinion of sabinus prevails .
when they could no longer withstand the attacks of our men , the one division , as they had begun to do , betook themselves to the mountain ; the other repaired to their baggage and wagons .

 respecting the disposition of the vitellianist army , disordered as it was by its fury and by the darkness , i would not venture to speak positively some , however , have related , that on the right wing was the 4th legion the macedonian that the 5th and 15th , with the veterans of three british legions the 9th , 2nd , and 20th , formed the centre , while the left wing was made up of the 1st , the 16th , and the 22nd

 but the brothers , having been acquainted with all things , either what was incomplete in our works , or what appeared to the best judges of military matters to be deficient , the particular times , the distance of places , and the various attention of the guards , according to the different temper and character of the officer who commanded the different posts , gave an exact account of all to pompey . 
 after a while , our frontier having been advanced , and our military positions pushed forward , it was regarded as a remote nook of our empire and a part of a roman province
 there were however some who believed that capito , though foully stained with avarice and profligacy , had yet abstained from all thought of revolution , that this was a treacherous accusation invented by the commanders themselves , who had urged him to take up arms , when they found themselves unable to prevail , and that galba had approved of the deed , either from weakness of character , or to avoid investigation into the circumstances of acts which could not be altered
when the helvetii are apprized of his arrival they send to him , as embassadors , the most illustrious men of their state , to say that it was their intention to march through the province without doing any harm , because they had no other route : that they requested , they might be allowed to do so with his consent .

 but the leading men of the state failed to convict him on all the charges when they pressed the case , he appealed to the emperor
 the legates and tribunes always follow the character of the emperor , and either imitate his strictness , or indulge in early conviviality
 yet the emperor , notwithstanding his irascible temper and an implacability proportioned to his reserve , was softened by the moderation and prudence of agricola , who neither by a perverse obstinacy nor an idle parade of freedom challenged fame or provoked his fate
 a tax of so much a head was laid on every slave and child columns , doors , corn , soldiers , sailors , arms , engines , and carriages , were made subject to a duty .

 this day will either be the most glorious among the deeds of the past , or will be infamous in the eyes of posterity these words were hailed , according to their custom , with the clash of arms and with wild antics , and then the battle was commenced by a discharge of stones , leaden balls , and other missiles , our soldiers not entering the morass , while the germans sought to provoke , and so draw them on
 the rest were either seized upon the beach , or were swamped by the weight of the crowds that rushed on board
they , by a design before entered into , as we afterwards understood , because they believed that , as a surrender had been made , our men would dismiss their guards , or at least would keep watch less carefully , partly with those arms which they had retained and concealed , partly with shields made of bark or interwoven wickers , which they had hastily covered over with skins , in the third watch , suddenly made a sally from the town with all their forces in which the ascent to our fortifications seemed the least difficult .
 sacrovir with his most trustworthy followers hurried first to augustodunum and then , from fear of being surrendered , to an adjacent country house
 every place was filled with mirth and congratulations ; in the one army , because they thought they had escaped so impending danger ; in the other , because they thought they had completed so important a matter without blows ; and caesar , in every man's judgment , reaped the advantage of his former lenity , and his conduct was applauded by all . 
therefore , although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him , on account of the breadth , rapidity , and depth of the river , he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted by him , or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over .

 at the same time those of the centurions and tribunes who pitied the lot of britannicus were removed , some on false pretexts , others by way of a seeming compliment

 you have already yielded to the prestige even of galba's family
he himself , meanwhile , drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of his four veteran legions in such a manner , that he placed above him on the very summit the two legions , which he had lately levied in hither gaul , and all the auxiliaries ; and he ordered that the whole mountain should be covered with men , and that meanwhile the baggage should be brought together into one place , and the position be protected by those who were posted in the upper line .
 he had made this the subject of earnest entreaties , anxious that his head might not be cut off and subjected to indignities
 agrippina , however , raved with a woman's fury about having a freedwoman for a rival , a slave girl for a daughter-in-law , with like expressions nor would she wait till her son repented or wearied of his passion the fouler her reproaches , the more powerfully did they inflame him , till completely mastered by the strength of his desire , he threw off all respect for his mother , and put himself under the guidance of seneca , one of whose friends , annaeus serenus , had veiled the young prince's intrigue in its beginning by pretending to be in love with the same woman , and had lent his name as the ostensible giver of the presents secretly sent by the emperor to the girl
 sosianus and sagitta were utterly insignificant , even if they did return

 tarsa however kept urging them to speedy death and to the instant breaking off of all hope and fear , and , by way of example , plunged his sword into his heart and there were some who chose the same death
 nor would he allow the prosecution of carinas celer , a senator , whom a slave accused , or of julius densus , a knight , whose partiality for britannicus was construed into a crime
he himself , having advanced by night about twelve miles , espied the forces of the enemy .
 but when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right , and observed our van was already passing the line of their camp , there was nobody so stupid , or averse to fatigue , as not to think it necessary to march from the camp immediately , and oppose us . 
 the vilest deeds went unpunished , while many noble acts brought ruin at last , in his sixth consulship , caesar augustus , feeling his power secure , annulled the decrees of his triumvirate , and gave us a constitution which might serve us in peace under a monarchy henceforth our chains became more galling , and spies were set over us , stimulated by rewards under the papia poppaea law , so that if men shrank from the privileges of fatherhood , the state , as universal parent , might possess their ownerless properties
 the whole of this interval they spent in many anxious thoughts the cowards trembled to think of those who had been massacred at the old camp
 one of the famous cities of asia , laodicea , was that same year overthrown by an earthquake , and , without any relief from us , recovered itself by its own resources
 knowing , as he did , how to be forbearing , when he was not under the stimulus of personal resentment , he further said that gyarus was a dreary and uninhabited island , and that , as a concession to the junian family and to a man of the same order as themselves , they might let him retire by preference to cythnus
 if indeed a province be of more importance than the capital and the safety of the empire , let us all follow them thither , but if the reality , the support , the mainstay of success , centre in italy , you must not tear , as it were , from a body its very strongest limbs
 this struck such terror into the enemy that he did not dare to attack our army , harassed though it was by violent storms
 marcus cotta was at this time governor of sardinia : marcus cato , of sicily : and tubero , by the lots , should have had the government of africa .

 this was the substance of his proposals : that it was the duty of both , to put an end to their obstinacy , and forbear hostilities , and not tempt fortune any further ; that sufficient loss had been suffered on both sides , to serve as a lesson and instruction to them , to render them apprehensive of future calamities , by pompey , in having been driven out of italy , and having lost sicily , cardinia , and the two spains , and one hundred and thirty cohorts of roman citizens , in italy and spain : by himself , in the death of curio , and the loss of so great an army in africa , and the surrender of his soldiers in corcyra . 
 i will briefly relate his downfall
 one would easily believe him a good man , and willingly believe him to be great
 in the one case , they said , the faculty of sight was not wholly destroyed , and might return , if the obstacies were removed
 he carried over land , into the inner part of the harbor , four galleys , by putting rollers under them , and driving them on with levers . 
 all the governors in these countries most cheerfully received him , and aided his army with every necessary . 
 we must punish the instruments of atrocious acts , when , having gained the rewards of wickedness , they impute the wickedness to others
the enemy not even then pursuing us , on the third day he repaired the bridge over the river allier , and led over his whole army .
 next came thirty-four auxiliary cohorts , distinguished according to the names or various equipments of the nations
 the column which took the right-hand and the shorter route , inflicted greater loss on the enemy who met them , and ventured on a battle with much spoil and glory they returned to mount taunus , where pomponius was waiting with the legions , to see whether the chatti , in their eagerness for vengeance , would give him a chance of fighting
 he sought to acquire a reputation for clemency by sparing a distinguished man opposed to his own party
 on the other side , the army of the britons , with its masses of infantry and cavalry , was confidently exulting , a vaster host than ever had assembled , and so fierce in spirit that they actually brought with them , to witness the victory , their wives riding in waggons , which they had placed on the extreme border of the plain
 there could be no doubt what peril a convoy , heavily laden and panic-stricken , would have to encounter in attempting to return
 after this , helvidius priscus , the praetor , first purified the spot with the usual sacrifice of a sow , a sheep , and a bull , and duly placed the entrails on turf then , in terms dictated by publius aelianus , the high-priest , besought jupiter , juno , minerva , and the tutelary deities of the place , to prosper the undertaking , and to lend their divine help to raise the abodes which the piety of men had founded for them

 they rushed from every part of the city into the palace and forum , and bursting into the circus and theatre , where the mob enjoy a special license , broke out into seditious clamours at length tigellinus , having received at the springs of sinuessa a message that his last hour was come , amid the embraces and caresses of his mistresses and other unseemly delays , cut his throat with a razor , and aggravated the disgrace of an infamous life by a tardy and ignominious death
 yet heaven knew that all were allowed to scourge and to execute

 corbulo was actually preparing to encamp on hostile soil when the despatch reached him
 the soldiers were all killed to a man marcus rufus , the quaestor , who was left behind in the camp by curio , having got intelligence of these things , encouraged his men not to be disheartened . 
 then followed the deaths of two illustrious men , domitius afer and marcus servilius , who had flourished through a career of the highest honours and great eloquence the first was a pleader servilius , after long practice in the courts , distinguished himself by his history of rome and by the refinement of his life , which the contrast of his character to that of afer , whom he equalled in genius , rendered the more conspicuous
 but the happy golden age , to speak in our own poetic fashion , knew neither orators nor accusations , while it abounded in poets and bards , men who could sing of good deeds , but not defend evil actions

 afterwards , that the royal family might not be without some superiority over the foreign stock , the strangers relinquished the craft which they had themselves introduced
 some delivered their sentiments with more moderation , as marcellus first , who in the beginning of his speech , said , that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter , till levies were made throughout all italy , and armies raised under whose protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as they thought proper ; as marcus calidius afterward , who was of opinion , that pompey should set out for his province , that there might be no cause for arms ; that caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced from him , that pompey was retaining those troops , and keeping them near the city to do him injury : as marcus rufus , who followed calidius almost word for word . 
litavicus , having received the command of the army , suddenly convened the soldiers , when he was about thirty miles distant from gergovia , and , weeping , said , soldiers , whither are we going ? all our knights and all our nobles have perished .
 the day was now fast drawing to a close , and the senate could not be convened , owing to the panic of the magistrates and senators , who had stolen out of the city , or were concealing themselves in the houses of dependants
 he must probe their inmost thoughts , when they were uttering their hopes and fears at the military mess , among themselves , and unwatched
the fight was carried on also at the baggage till late in the night , for they had set wagons in the way as a rampart , and from the higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men , as they came on , and some from between the wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and javelins from beneath , and wounding our men .
as he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner than any one anticipated , the remi , who are the nearest of the belgae to gaul , sent to him iccius and andecombogius , the principal persons of the state , as their embassadors : to tell him that they surrendered themselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of the roman people : and that they had neither combined with the rest of the belgae , nor entered into any confederacy against the roman people : and were prepared to give hostages , to obey his commands , to receive him into their towns , and to aid him with corn and other things ; that all the rest of the belgae were in arms ; and that the germans , who dwell on this side of the rhine , had joined themselves to them ; and that so great was the infatuation of them all , that they could not restrain even the suessiones , their own brethren and kinsmen , who enjoy the same rights , and the , same laws , and who have one government and one magistracy with themselves , from uniting with them .
nor does vorenus remain within the rampart , but respecting the high opinion of all , follows close after .
 the other , of the claims of fatherland , of ancestral freedom , of the gods of the homes of germany , of the mother who shared his prayers , that flavus might not choose to be the deserter and betrayer rather than the ruler of his kinsfolk and relatives , and indeed of his own people

 to him and to vinicius the emperor married respectively drusilla and julia , germanicus's daughters , and addressed a letter on the subject to the senate , with a slightly complimentary mention of the young men
 they were immediately dislodged by the attack of some thracian infantry closely pursued by the germans and rhaetians they were cut down in their forests and even in their hiding places
 in the theatricals performed by young men during the reign of nero , at first apparently from compulsion , afterwards of his own free choice , he repeatedly acted in the farces , with more cleverness than propriety
he himself goes to the rest , and exhorts them not to succumb to the toil ; he shows them that the fruits of all former engagements depend on that day and hour .
 they applied their ears to apertures and crevices latiaris meanwhile having met sabinus in the streets , drew him to his house and to the room , as if he was going to communicate some fresh discoveries
 hence their alarm and reasonable importunity in begging for help , before the enemy , recovering their strength , could raise their spirits for a new effort or for thoughts of revenge
 their reply was 
 pompeius propinquus , procurator of belgica , was immediately put to death
 to these representations the embarrassed vitellius answered a few words in his own exculpation , throwing all the blame upon the soldiers , with whose excessive zeal his moderation was , he said , unable to cope
 vitellius did not turn away his eyes , did not shudder to behold the unburied corpses of so many thousands of his countrymen
 as our bodies grow but slowly , perish in a moment , so it is easier to crush than to revive genius and its pursuits
 the legion was , however , marched overland under the command of fabius priscus into the territory of the nervii and tungri , and these two states were allowed to capitulate
 soon the annual celebration was transferred to the praetor , to whose lot fell the administration of justice between citizens and foreigners
nor did vercingetorix use less efforts than he had promised , to gain over the other states , and endeavored to entice their leaders by gifts and promises .
 as a fact , secundus had a pure , terse , and a sufficiently fluent style , while aper , who was imbued with learning of all kinds , pretended to despise the culture which he really possessed he would have , so he must have thought , a greater reputation for industry and application , if it should appear that his genius did not depend on any supports from pursuits alien to his profession
 between the parthians and ourselves there was an ancient friendship , founded on a state alliance , and we ought to support allies who were our rivals in strength , and yet yielded to us out of respect
 hitherto , you have only borne adversity
 at last they stript off their clothes and threw them on the fire , which they were the more likely to quench , the more they had been soiled by common use
 there was some little delay in the ascent , while the troops were passing through the range of the enemy's missiles
 the vitellianists , taking their stand on the garden-walls , kept off the assailants with stones and javelins till late in the day , when they were taken in the rear by the cavalry , which had then forced an entrance by the colline gate
 nero offered his gardens for the spectacle , and was exhibiting a show in the circus , while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car
 the daily records of the roman people are read attentively in the provinces and the armies that they may know what thrasea has not done
 in the same remote corner of germany , bordering on the ocean dwell the cimbri , a now insignificant tribe , but of great renown
 mucianus in frequent letters advised the same policy a victory that should cost neither blood nor tears , and other objects of the kind , were his pretexts but in truth he was greedy of glory , and anxious to keep the whole credit of the war to himself
 raising the population , in which is no lack of able-bodied men , he resolved to drive back the othonianists from the borders of his province
 and the more they endeavoured to hide and repress their alarm the more evident was their terror on the other hand , there were some who with senseless ostentation purchased splendid arms and magnificent horses , and some who procured by way of equipments for the war the luxurious furniture of the banquet and other incentives to profligacy
 forty thousand armed men burst into cremona , and with them a body of sutlers and camp-followers , yet more numerous and yet more abandoned to lust and cruelty
 they trust wholly to their arrows , which , for want of iron , are pointed with bone
 meanwhile caecina and valens remained quiet , and watched intently for the moment when the enemy in his blindness should rush upon destruction , and found the usual substitute for wisdom in waiting for the folly of others they began to form a bridge , making a feint of crossing the padus , in the face of an opposing force of gladiators
on that day he follows the enemy at his usual distance , and pitches his camp three miles from theirs .
he ordered the helvetii , the tulingi , and the latobrigi , to return to their territories from which they had come , and as there was at home nothing whereby they might support their hunger , all the productions of the earth having been destroyed , he commanded the allobroges to let them have a plentiful supply of corn ; and ordered them to rebuild the towns and villages which they had burned .
 many in attempting to swim across the visurgis were overwhelmed under a storm of missiles or by the force of the current , lastly , by the rush of fugitives and the falling in of the banks
 the same year saw many impeached
 sulla , the most ruthless of the patricians , who perverted into absolute dominion the liberty which had yielded to their arms
 what orator have we ever heard of at sparta or at crete
 in addition were some slaves who were being trained for gladiators , clad after the national fashion in a complete covering of steel
 pedanius costa was passed over the emperor disliked him because he had risen against nero , and roused verginius to revolt
 it was , he thought , a very alarming thing for him that the name of a subject should be raised above that of the emperor
 near this place was stationed marius maturus , procurator of the maritime alps , who was loyal to vitellius , and who , though everything around him was hostile , had not yet thrown off his allegiance
 after this caesar , enamoured of her beauty , took her away from her husband , whether against her wish is uncertain so impatient was he that he brought her to his house actually pregnant , not allowing time for her confinement
 and by liberal gifts of spoil and prisoners to the other tribes , they were luring them too into revolt , when ostorius , worn out by the burden of his anxieties , died , to the joy of the enemy , who thought that a campaign at least , though not a single battle , had proved fatal to general whom none could despise
the enemy surrounded on all sides , all their affairs being despaired of , made great attempts to cast themselves down over the ramparts and to seek safety in flight .
 there lay between the two armies a valley , as already mentioned , not very deep , but of a difficult and steep ascent . 
 but caesar , relying on the fame of his exploits , did not hesitate to set forward with a feeble force , and thought that he would be secure in any place . 
 the origin of this god serapis has not hitherto been made generally known by our writers
 he was adopted as a son , as a colleague in empire and a partner in the tribunitian power , and paraded through all the armies , no longer through his mother's secret intrigues , but at her open suggestion
 the pretender himself , assuming a studied appearance of sorrow , and appealing to their fidelity as old soldiers of his own , besought them to land him in egypt or syria
 among nobles who can show a long succession of glories , has my new name become famous
 these speeches , which were delivered with much vehemence on both sides , were heard with much diversity of feeling
their funerals , considering the state of civilization among the gauls , are magnificent and costly ; and they cast into the fire all things , including living creatures , which they suppose to have been dear to them when alive ; and , a little before this period , slaves and dependents , who were ascertained to have been beloved by them , were , after the regular funeral rites were completed , burnt together with them .
 hence a rank growth of abominations and of all infamy never did a more filthy rabble add a worse licentiousness to our long corrupted morals
 and polyclitus , who with his enormous suite had been a burden to italy and gaul , failed not , as soon as he had crossed the ocean , to make his progresses a terror even to our soldiers
 in the number of caesar's cavalry were two allobrogians , brothers , named roscillus and aegus , the sons of abducillus , who for several years possessed the chief power in his own state ; men of singular valor , whose gallant services caesar had found very useful in all his wars in gaul . 
after completing these works , saving selected as level ground as he could , considering the nature of the country , and having inclosed an area of fourteen miles , he constructed , against an external enemy , fortifications of the same kind in every respect , and separate from these , so that the guards of the fortifications could not be surrounded even by immense numbers , if such a circumstance should take place owing to the departure of the enemy's cavalry ; and in order that the roman soldiers might not be compelled to go out of the camp with great risk , he orders all to provide forage and corn for thirty days .
 and so rhadamistus having attempted the fortified walls in vain or with loss , began a blockade , and , finding that his assaults were despised , tried to bribe the rapacity of the camp-prefect casperius protested earnestly against the overthrow of an allied king and of armenia , the gift of the roman people , through iniquity and greed of gain
 the territory of the treveri they entered with all the security naturally felt among allies
 i want to hear the rest
 our men , more alive to the danger , threw , but not at random , stakes shod with iron and heavy stones
 some beat down the unwieldy mass with pikes and forked poles , and they were left lying on the ground , without an effort to rise , like dead men
 the advanced years and childless condition of the emperor furnished matter for such gossip , and the country never can refrain from naming many persons until one be chosen
 the ill-feeling had been aggravated by the gladiatorial show exhibited there by caecina , by the circumstance that their city was now for the second time the seat of war , and by the fact that they had supplied the vitellianists with provisions in the field , and that some of their women , taken by party-zeal into the battle , had there been slain
 the knights called the seats in the theatre known as the juniors , germanicus's benches , and arranged that their squadrons were to ride in procession behind his effigy on the fifteenth of july
 it was , in fact , natalis alone who divulged seneca's name , to this extent , that he had been sent to seneca when ailing , to see him and remonstrate with him for excluding piso from his presence , when it would have been better to have kept up their friendship by familiar intercourse
at day-break , when the summit of the mountain was in the possession of titus labienus , and he himself was not further off than a mile and half from the enemy's camp , nor , as he afterward ascertained from the captives , had either his arrival or that of labienus been discovered ; considius , with his horse at full gallop , comes up to him says that the mountain which he wished should be seized by labienus , is in possession of the enemy ; that he has discovered this by the gallic arms and ensigns .
 what again , they asked , was the charge against agrippinus except his father's sad fate , since he too , though guiltless as his son , fell beneath the cruelty of tiberius
 next he charged stertinius with making war on the angrivarii , but they hastened to surrender
 all the circumstances were subsequently so well known , that writers of the time have declared that the poison was infused into some mushrooms , a favourite delicacy , and its effect not at the instant perceived , from the emperor's lethargic , or intoxicated condition
 thrasea , he said , at the beginning of the year always avoided the usual oath of allegiance
 the soldiers will possess themselves of the lands of the germans and will carry off their wives
 but the more loyal his adherents , the more did they protest against peace and negotiation they pointed out the danger and disgrace of a submission in which the caprice of the conqueror would be their sole guarantee
he charges him to visit the remi and the other belgae , and to keep them in their allegiance and repel the germans if they attempted to cross the river by force in their ships .
 this provoked an indignant outburst it is not , she exclaimed , for the same man to slay victims to the divine augustus and to persecute his posterity
after he had made three days march through their territories , he discovered from some prisoners , that the river sambre was not more than ten miles from his camp ; that all the nervii had stationed themselves on the other side of that river , and together with the atrebates and the viromandui , their neighbors , were there awaiting the arrival of the romans ; for they had persuaded both these nations to try the same fortune of war : that the forces of the aduatuci were also expected by them , and were on their march ; that they had put their women , and those who through age appeared useless for war , in a place to which there was no approach for an army , on account of the marshes .
 the soldiers saw what a mockery it was , and pushing aside those who were guarding the tribunal , were about to commit the most outrageous violence
 there was greater danger at grinnes and vada
 some weapon ought to be given to the patrons which could not be despised
 vocula , though many persons advised him to escape , thought it best to be bold , and , summoning an assembly , spoke as follows 
 at this time the legion in africa was commanded by valerius festus , a young man of extravagant habits and immoderate ambition , who was now made uneasy by his relationship to vitellius
he , after perusing it , reads it out in an assembly of the soldiers , and fills all with the greatest joy .
 the distance was very great , and the roads were blocked up with heaps of corpses
 suetonius paullinus , marius celsus , and annius gallus , were appointed to command the infantry and cavalry the emperor , however , placed most confidence in licinius proculus , prefect of the praetorian guard
 our army advanced in the following order
 as more came up , the fortune of the day changed , and those who had been most eager in the pursuit found themselves last in the flight
 the cohorts , pursuing their success , wheeled about upon pompey's left wing , while his infantry still continued to make battle , and attacked them in the rear . 
 at the same time domitian and mucianus prepared to set out , but in a very different mood domitian in all the hope and impatience of youth , mucianus ever contriving delays to check his ardent companion , who , he feared , were he to intrude himself upon the army , might be led by the recklessness of youth or by bad advisers to compromise at once the prospects of war and of peace
 when caesar's affairs were in this unfavorable position , and all the passes were guarded by the soldiers and horse of afranius , and the bridges could not be prepared , caesar ordered his soldiers to make ships of the kind that his knowledge of britain a few years before had taught him . 
the result was , that caesar did not allow excursions to be made to a great distance from the main body of the legions , and ordered that damage should be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands , and kindling fires only so far as the legionary soldiers could , by their own exertion and marching , accomplish it .
 but laelius having chosen a more convenient season of the year for his expedition , supplied himself with water brought in transports from corcyra and dyrrachium , and was not deterred from his purpose ; and till he had received advice of the battle in thessaly , he could not be forced either by the disgrace of losing his ships , or by the want of necessaries , to quit the port and islands . 
 it is by my sword that i have asserted the excellence of the roman people since , however , words have very great weight with you , since you estimate good and evil , not according to their real value , but according to the representations of seditious men , i have resolved to say a few words , which , as the war is at an end , it may be useful for you to have heard rather than for me to have spoken roman generals and emperors entered your territory , as they did the rest of gaul , with no ambitious purposes , but at the solicitation of your ancestors , who were wearied to the last extremity by intestine strife , while the germans , whom they had summoned to their help , had imposed their yoke alike on friend and foe how many battles we have fought against the cimbri and teutones , at the cost of what hardships to our armies , and with what result we have waged our german wars , is perfectly well known
 they were accordingly collected before the steps of the palace , and piso addressed them as follows 
 when news of this battle was brought to caesar at ilerda , the bridge being completed at the same time , fortune soon took a turn . 
 before long you will hear that italy has been opened , and the power of vitellius shaken
 the city was fired , demolished and levelled to the ground , as it could not be held without a strong garrison from the extent of the walls , and we had not sufficient force to be divided between adequately garrisoning it and carrying on the war if again the place were left untouched and unguarded , no advantage or glory would accrue from its capture
 at augusta of the taurini it happened that a batavian soldier fiercely charged some artisan with having cheated him , and that a soldier of the legion took the part of his host
 to abandon your shield is the basest of crimes
 with purposes no longer doubtful they parted , mucianus for antioch , vespasian for caesarea these cities are the capitals of syria and judaea respectively the initiative in transferring the empire to vespasian was taken at alexandria under the prompt direction of tiberius alexander , who on the 1st of july made the legions swear allegiance to him that day was ever after celebrated as the first of his reign , though the army of judaea on july 3rd took the oath to vespasian in person with such eager alacrity that they would not wait for the return of his son titus , who was then on his way back from syria , acting as the medium between mucianus and his father for the communication of their plans
 a few who survived the battle concealed themselves in the marshes
 the spirit of the rest of the army was broken , but the praetorians angrily complained that they had been vanquished , not by valour , but by treachery
 it was a terrible and hideous sight that presented itself throughout the city
 what was the ruin of sparta and athens , but this , that mighty as they were in war , they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered
 marius maturus was then governing as procurator the province of the maritime alps
 because we were all members of one city
 near , lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses , and also human heads , prominently nailed to trunks of trees
 the same tribe also routed a crowd of nervii , who by a spontaneous movement had taken up arms on the roman side
 envoys were sent to the canninefates to urge a common policy
 a like courage made several roman knights of the first rank desirous of a speedy doom titius proculus , who had been appointed to watch messalina and was now offering his evidence , vettius valens , who confessed his guilt , together with pompeius urbicus and saufellus trogus from among her accomplices , were ordered to execution decius calpurnianus too , commander of the watch , sulpicius rufus , who had the charge of the games , and juncus virgilianus , a senator , were similarly punished
 again , even honour and virtue make enemies , condemning , as they do , their opposites by too close a contrast
 on their arrival at sinope , they delivered to scydrothemis the presents from their king , with his request and message
there was a town of the remi , by name bibrax , eight miles distant from this camp .
 they were first divided , and then ordered , though with the gratifying compliment of an honourable discharge , to give up their arms to their tribunes but as the arms vespasian gathered strength , they returned to their old service , and constituted the mainstay of the flavianist party
 to his splendid public liberality the emperor added bounties no less popular the property of aemilia musa , a rich woman who died intestate , on which the imperial treasury had a claim , he handed over to aemilius lepidus , to whose family she appeared to belong and the estate of patuleius , a wealthy roman knight , though he was himself left in part his heir , he gave to marcus servilius , whose name he discovered in an earlier and unquestioned will in both these cases he said that noble rank ought to have the support of wealth
 caesar followed up the enthusiasm of the men , and having bridged over the rhine , he sent across it 12 , 000 from the legions , with six-and-twenty allied cohorts , and eight squadrons of cavalry , whose discipline had been without a stain during the mutiny
 they must , they said , anticipate attack by a hand to hand charge
in the mean time he sends messengers to the officers who had marched in advance with all the cavalry , to order them not to provoke the enemy to an engagement , and if they themselves were assailed , to sustain the attack until he came up with the army .
 there was now an opportunity for managing affairs successfully , nor did it escape caesar , that an army daunted at suffering such a loss before their eyes , could not stand , especially as they were surrounded by our horse , and the engagement would take place on even and open ground . 
 but their self-confidence induced a tardiness of movement proportionate to their strength and solidity
he never ceased to importune the boii and aedui for supplies of corn ; of whom the one , because they were acting with no zeal , did not aid him much ; the others , as their resources were not great , quickly consumed what they had .
 for having advanced four miles , and being very much harassed by our horse , they took post on a high mountain , and there in trenched themselves on the front only , facing the enemy ; and did not take their baggage off their cattle . 
 the respectable portion of the people , which was connected with the great families , as well as the dependants and freedmen of condemned and banished persons , were high in hope
 resume the manners and customs of your country , renouncing the pleasures , through which , rather than through their arms , the romans secure their power against subject nations
 and petilius cerialis had been defeated in a cavalry skirmish
 meanwhile domitius having landed at laodicea , a city of syria , as he was on his way to the winter-quarters of the sixth legion , which was , he believed , particularly open to revolutionary schemes , was anticipated by its commander pacuvius
 soldiers attended him to the forum
 it is not the chief duty of friends to follow the dead with unprofitable laments , but to remember his wishes , to fulfil his commands
 at the same time he gave a large army to his son , who by a sudden invasion drove mithridates in terror from the open country and forced him into the fortress of gorneas , which was strongly situated and garrisoned by some soldiers under the command of caelius pollio , a camp-prefect , and casperius , a centurion
 chairs of state with oaken garlands over them were to be set up in the places assigned to the priesthood of the augustales
caesar , when this circumstance was announced to him , thought that the march to narbo ought to take the precedence of all his other plans .
 at the same time a batavian deserter came up to cerialis , offering an opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear , if some cavalry were sent along the edge of the morass
 he drew up on the field eighty cohorts , making a total of twenty-two thousand men . 
when he arrived there , he sends information to the rest of the legions , and gathers all his army into one place before intelligence of his arrival could be announced to the arverni .
but here there is no fortification to receive them , in their alarm : those last enlisted , and unskilled in military discipline turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions ; they wait to find what orders may be given by them .
 this hindered them from combining in a formidable war
 it was thought expedient to send with them cornelius laco , prefect of the praetorian guard , but he thwarted the design
 but there were many things to exasperate the already divided feelings of the soldiery
 a constitution , formed by selection out of these elements , it is easy to commend but not to produce
 some of the royal tributes were diminished , to inspire hope of a gentler rule under rome
 there were also present , to complete the show , a guard of soldiers with centurions and tribunes , and burrus , who grieved and yet applauded
 having spoken these and like words , meant , so to say , for all , he embraced his wife then softening awhile from the stern resolution of the hour , he begged and implored her to spare herself the burden of perpetual sorrow , and , in the contemplation of a life virtuously spent , to endure a husband's loss with honourable consolations
 we have already taken the hardest step
 it is not so much an articulate sound , as a general cry of valour
upon their territories bordered the nervii , concerning whose character and customs when caesar inquired he received the following information : —that there was no access for merchants to them ; that they suffered no wine and other things tending to luxury to be imported ; because , they thought that by their use the mind is enervated and the courage impaired : that they were a savage people and of great bravery : that they upbraided and condemned the rest of the belgae who had surrendered themselves to the roman people and thrown aside their national courage : that they openly declared they would neither send embassadors , nor accept any condition of peace .
 but afranius's army had abundance of everything ; a great stock of corn had been provided and laid in long before , a large quantity was coming in from the whole province : they had a good store of forage . 
 a tax also of four per cent on the sale of slaves was remitted , an apparent more than a real boon , for as the seller was ordered to pay it , purchasers found that it was added as part of the price
this action caused great perplexity to caesar in the selection of his plans ; lest , if he should confine his legions in one place for the remaining portion of the winter , all gaul should revolt when the tributaries of the aedui were subdued , because it would appear that there was in him no protection for his friends ; but if he should draw them too soon out of their winter quarters , he might be distressed by the want of provisions , in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance .
 thus it was that sacrovir and the aedui in former days , vindex and the gauls in more recent times , were crushed in a single battle
 however , the repeal of the two per cent and two-and-a-half per cent taxes remains in force , as well as that of others bearing names invented by the collectors to cover their illegal exactions
 when he arrived , they were invited to a conference . 
 as soon as the camp was completed , he crept gradually into the affections of the soldiers by mixing with them and addressing them by name , himself selecting the centurions and tribunes
all view being prevented by the darkness , many wounds are received on both sides ; several missiles , are thrown from the engines .
 many acted in ignorance and were stupefied by wine , the worst among them were seeking an opportunity for plunder , the mass was as usual ready for any new movement , and the military obedience of the better disposed was neutralised by the darkness the tribune , who sought to check the movement , and the strictest disciplinarians among the centurions , were cut down
 yet means had been provided whereby he might pay the penalty of having destroyed the state
 first and twentieth legions , you who received your standards from tiberius , you , men of the twentieth who have shared with me so many battles and have been enriched with so many rewards , is not this a fine gratitude with which you are repaying your general
 here eloquence had her earliest beginnings
 when varro , terrified at these things , having altered his route , proposed going to italica , he was informed by his friends that the gates were shut against him . 
 but it is with you , maternus , that i am dealing for , when your genius might carry you to the summit of eloquence , you prefer to wander from the path , and though sure to win the highest prize you stop short at meaner things just as , if you had been born in greece , where it is an honour to practise even the arts of the arena , and if the gods had given you the vigour and strength of nicostratus , i should not suffer those giant arms meant by nature for combat to waste themselves on the light javelin or the throwing of the quoit , so now i summon you from the lecture-room and the theatre to the law court with its pleadings and its real battles
the belgae rises from the extreme frontier of gaul , extend to the lower part of the river rhine ; and look toward the north and the rising sun .
he fortified this part with a rampart and a ditch .
the mandubii , who had admitted them into the town , are compelled to go forth with their wives and children .
 he rose without a moment's delay , and every preparation was at once made
 consequently the wrath of sejanus was the more furious , and he had ground for alleging that the senate disregarded the emperor's trouble
 it is far from opportune that the emperor's cares , now in their first beginning , should be aggravated
thus without any risk our men killed as great a number of them as the length of the day allowed ; and at sunset desisted from the pursuit , and betook themselves into the camp , as they had been commanded .
 a doubt arises at this point , whether it was the assailants who threw lighted brands on to the roofs , or whether , as the more general account has it , the besieged thus sought to repel the assailants , who were now making vigorous progress
 a rumour that he was slain , which was believed by mistake , struck panic into the parthians , and they yielded the victory
 he would hardly be the inferior of tiberius , and as for tiberius's children , he looked down on them as far beneath him
after this engagement , caesar considered that neither ought embassadors to be received to audience , nor conditions be accepted by him from those who , after having sued for peace by way of stratagem and treachery , had made war without provocation .
 we are being deprived , they said , of the help of our bravest men
 but varus fell by fate and by the sword of arminius , with whom segestes , though dragged into war by the unanimous voice of the nation , continued to be at feud , his resentment being heightened by personal motives , as arminius had married his daughter who was betrothed to another
 oscus , a freedman , retained the charge of the fleet , and went to watch the fidelity of men more honourable than himself
 nature had admirably provided for human interests in having assigned to rivers their mouths , their channels , and their limits , as well as their sources
 if such practices are stopped , our provinces will be ruled more equitably and more steadily
 let these , at least , be restored safely to their grandsire and to the state
 then too there was a wonderful occurrence , almost a divine interposition
 he dined , indulged himself in sleep , that death , though forced on him , might have a natural appearance
moreover , ariovistus , no sooner did he defeat the forces of the gauls in a battle which took place at magetobriga , than to lord it haughtily and cruelly , to demand as hostages the children of all the principal nobles , and wreak on them every kind of cruelty , if every thing was not done at his nod or pleasure ; that he was a savage , passionate , and reckless man , and that his commands could no longer be borne .
 as for inguiomerus , who flew hither and thither over the battlefield , it was fortune rather than courage which forsook him
there is a third kind , consisting of those animals which are called uri .
 the gallic auxiliaries , who felt neither affection nor hatred towards either party , and who served without attachment , at once , at the instance of their prefects , deserted vitellius
 an appeal was made to the senate under a keen sense of wrong parents pleaded natural rights and the anxieties of nurture against fraudulent evasions and the brief ceremony of adoption
 and the longer it was deferred , the more eager were those who commanded pompey's fleet to guard the coast , and were more confident of preventing our getting assistance : they received frequent reproofs from pompey by letter , that as they had not prevented caesar's arrival at the first , they should at least stop the remainder of his army : and they were expecting that the season for transporting troops , would become more unfavorable every day , as the winds grew calmer . 
 doubtless there was thrill of alarm when they thought of the apathy of claudius , of his devotion to his wife and of the many murders perpetrated at messalina's bidding
but the enemy , who were acquainted with all the shallows , when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by one , spurred on their horses , and attacked them while embarrassed ; many surrounded a few , others threw their weapons upon our collected forces on their exposed flank .
 my own earnest thoughts and the ties with which i am still purposing to unite you to myself , i shall for the present forbear to explain
 subsequently a quarrel broke out between them , followed instantly by war , and he then assumed a hostile attitude also towards us at first , however , they simply fought against each other , and cartismandua by cunning stratagems captured the brothers and kinsfolk of venutius
 it is wonderful how entirely the courage of this people is , so to speak , external to themselves
a slaughter ensues in every direction , and three of the noblest of the aedui are taken and brought to caesar : cotus , the commander of the cavalry , who had been engaged in the contest with convictolitanis the last election , cavarillus , who had held the command of the infantry after the revolt of litavicus , and eporedirix , under whose command the aedui had engaged in war against the sequani , before the arrival of caesar .
 on the arrival of vibullius rufus , whom , we have already mentioned , pompey had sent into spain , afranius , petreius , and varro , his lieutenants one of whom had the command of hither spain , with three legions ; the second of the country from the forest of castulo to the river guadiana with two legions ; the third from the river guadiana to the country of the vettones and lusitania , with the like number of legions divided among themselves their respective departments . 
 lentulus urging the respect due to his age , domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity , and scipio presuming on his alliance with pompey . 
 in his endeavour to win over all who were particularly weak in character , or who wanted money and were ready to plunge into revolution , he gradually went so far as to distribute , whenever galba dined with otho , one hundred sesterces to each soldier of the cohort on duty , under pretext of treating them this , which we may almost call a public bounty , otho followed up by presents more privately bestowed on individuals
when he had arrived there , he levies soldiers upon the states , and orders them to assemble at an appointed place .
 here he ordered a part of his men of war to attend him , and corn and provisions to be brought from asia , and from all the countries of which he kept possession . 
 there was indeed no more frequent subject of conversation during these months , at first because men had liberty and inclination to talk of such matters , afterwards because the feebleness of galba was notorious
 agrippina in stubborn rage , with the grasp of disease yet on her , when the emperor came to see her , wept long and silently , and then began to mingle reproach and supplication
 my present lot is as glorious to you as it is degrading to myself
 about the same time fabius valens was put to death while in confinement at urbinum
 not without good reason had our ancestors , in distinguishing the position of the different orders , thrown freedom open to all
 sulla is poor , and hence comes his surpassing audacity he shams apathy , while he is seeking an opening for his reckless ambition
 he ordered caius silius with thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry to march against the chatti
as if , said he , it were a matter of deliberation , and not of necessity , for us to go to gergovia and unite ourselves to the arverni .
 thus the words of a slave brought on him the whole odium of having given the signal for firing the town , which was indeed already in flames
that , if the romans in the mean time came up by chance , they should feel grateful to fortune ; if invited by the information of some one they should feel grateful to him , because they were enabled to see distinctly from the higher ground the smallness of the number of their enemy , and despise the courage of those who , not daring to fight , retreated disgracefully into their camp .
 at his direction , a pit was dug in a neighbouring field flavus , on seeing it , censured it as too shallow and confined , saying to the soldiers around him , even this is not according to military rule
 wherefore , having received equal favors from both , they ought to show equal affection to both , and assist neither against the other , nor admit either into their city or harbors .

he appoints crassus over samarobriva and assigns him a legion , because he was leaving there the baggage of the army , the hostages of the states , the public documents , and all the corn , which he had conveyed thither for passing the winter .
considering this by no means a fit place for disembarking , he remained at anchor till the ninth hour , for the other ships to arrive there .
 his father , as i have related , had been a censor

 julius civilis , a man of commanding influence among the batavi , was next rescued from like circumstances of peril , lest that high-spirited nation should be alienated by his execution
 i shall have whatever honour you think fit to bestow on me
 soon afterwards , by the arrival of aesculapius , the art of the physician was introduced and was practised with much fame by his descendants claudius named them one by one , with the periods in which they had respectively flourished
 a priest in female attire has the charge of it
if our men seemed to be distressed , or hard pressed in any quarter , caesar usually ordered the troops to advance , and the army to wheel round in that quarter ; which conduct retarded the enemy in the pursuit , and encouraged our men by the hope of support .
 nor could they endure the delay of deliberation they rivalled each other in vehement assertions that the romans were in a frenzy of discord , that their legions had been cut to pieces , that italy was laid waste , that rome itself was at that very moment undergoing capture , while all her armies were occupied by wars of their own
 the cavalry and the legions fearlessly crossed the first estuaries in which the tide had not yet risen the rear of the auxiliaries , and the batavi among the number , plunging recklessly into the water and displaying their skill in swimming , fell into disorder , and some were drowned
the situation of the camp was a rising ground , gently sloping from the bottom for about a mile .
 her youth still fitted her for marriage , which was a virtuous woman's only solace , and there were citizens in rome who would not disdain to receive the wife of germanicus and his children
 at all events , he was surprised at midday , when stripped for exercise
 vitellius , compelled by threatening swords , first to raise his face and offer it to insulting blows , then to behold his own statues falling round him , and more than once to look at the rostra and the spot where galba was slain , was then driven along till they reached the gemoniae , the place where the corpse of flavius sabinus had lain
 crispus was of equestrian descent and grandson of a sister of caius sallustius , that most admirable roman historian , by whom he was adopted and whose name he took
 classicus for the most part wasted his time in indolent repose , as if he had only to enjoy an empire already won
to whatever part any one by chance came from the works , and whatever standards he saw first , at these he stood , lest in seeking his own company he should lose the time for fighting .
 the lingones , following an old custom , had sent presents to the legions , right hands clasped together , an emblem of friendship
 the same summer a great battle was fought between the hermunduri and the chatti , both forcibly claiming a river which produced salt in plenty , and bounded their territories they had not only a passion for settling every question by arms , but also a deep-rooted superstition that such localities are specially near to heaven , and that mortal prayers are nowhere more attentively heard by the gods
 for the emperor had appointed two men to the command of the praetorian cohorts , faenius rufus , for a vulgar popularity , which he owed to his administration of the corn-supplies without profit to himself and sofonius tigellinus , whose inveterate shamelessness and infamy were an attraction to him
 the slave with a noble untruth replied , i am he , and was immediately cut down
of these eporedirix , on learning the design of litavicus , lays the matter before caesar almost at midnight ; he entreats that caesar should not suffer their state to swerve from the alliance with the roman people , owing to the depraved counsels of a few young men which he foresaw would be the consequence if so many thousand men should unite themselves to the enemy , as their relations could not neglect their safety , nor the state regard it as a matter of slight importance .
around him all the arverni crowd in alarm , and solemnly entreat him to protect their property , and not to suffer them to be plundered by the enemy , especially as he saw that all the war was transferred into their country .
 at last , after five days , an end was put to the conflagration at the foot of the esquiline hill , by the destruction of all buildings on a vast space , so that the violence of the fire was met by clear ground and an open sky
 the wording of the proclamation was brief , and in a very modest tone
 the chief adviser of the parthians in sending the secret embassy was sinnaces , a man of distinguished family and corresponding wealth next in influence was abdus , an eunuch , a class which , far from being despised among barbarians , actually possesses power
 they made it into a sort of bread . 
 brutus was much inferior in number of ships ; but caesar had appointed to that fleet the bravest men selected from all his legions , antesignani and centurions , who had requested to be employed in that service . 
 if in your weariness of land and sea you desire an end of service , this battle prepares the way to it the elbe is now nearer than the rhine , and there is no war beyond , provided only you enable me , keeping close as i do to my father's and my uncle's footsteps , to stand a conqueror on the same spot
 admirably adapted to the action of the latter is the swiftness of certain foot-soldiers , who are picked from the entire youth of their country , and stationed in front of the line
 nero meanwhile summoned the senate , addressed them in a speech , and further added a proclamation to the people , with the evidence which had been entered on records , and the confessions of the condemned
 julius gratus , prefect of the camp , was put in irons , on a suspicion of a treacherous understanding with his brother who was serving with otho's army , at the very time that the othonianists had done the same thing and on the same grounds to that brother julius fronto , a tribune
 they refused neither barley nor pulse when offered them , and they held in great esteem cattle , of which they got great quantities from epirus . 
 we know most of its harbours and approaches , and that through the intercourse of commerce
 a law was passed , adopting him into the claudian family with the name of nero
caesar proceeded , after encouraging the tenth legion , to the right wing ; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed , and that in consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected together in one place , the crowded soldiers were a hinderance to themselves in the fight ; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain , and the standard-bearer killed , the standard itself lost , almost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain , and among them the chief centurion of the legion publius sextius baculus , a very valiant man , who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds , that he was already unable to support himself ; he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts , and that some , deserted by those in the rear , were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons ; that the enemy though advancing from the lower ground , were not relaxing in front , and were pressing hard on both flanks ; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis , and that there was not any reserve which could be brought up , having therefore snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear , he advanced to the front of the line , and addressing the centurions by name , and encouraging the rest of the soldiers , he ordered them to carry forward the standards , and extend the companies , that they might the more easily use their swords .
caesar had conveyed hither all the hostages of gaul , the corn , public money , a great part of his own baggage and that of his army ; he had sent hither a great number of horses , which he had purchased in italy and spain on account of this war .
 elated by their victory and their booty , the conquerors passed a night of merriment
 these are recent memories
 on the other hand , those who had stayed behind complained that they were , being left to their fate by this withdrawal of a part of the legions
then the smoke of the fires was seen in the distance , a circumstance which banished all doubt of the arrival of the legions .
that , moreover , the germans should by degrees become accustomed to cross the rhine , and that a great body of them should come into gaul , he saw dangerous to the roman people , and judged , that wild and savage men would not be likely to restrain themselves , after they had possessed themselves of all gaul , from going forth into the province and thence marching into italy , particularly as the rhône separated the sequani from our province .
 yet the peril of so great a man did not make him relent , till haterius went with entreaties to augusta , and was saved by her very earnest intercessions
a short time only having elapsed , so that time was scarcely given for arranging and executing those things which they had determined on , the enemy , upon the signal being given , rushed down from all parts , and discharged stones and darts , upon our rampart .
 unmoved by these considerations , piso showed himself a few moments in public , then sought the retirement of his house , and there fortified his spirit against the worst , till a troop of soldiers arrived , raw recruits , or men recently enlisted , whom nero had selected , because he was afraid of the veterans , imbued , though they were , with a liking for him
 it was an undoubted fact that some of them vented their rage on their wives and children , as if in pity for their lot
 they were dining in a country house called the cave , between the gulf of amuclae and the hills of fundi , in a natural grotto
in the mean time , the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army , as a guard for the baggage-train , upon the battle being reported to them , quickened their pace , and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill ; and titus labienus , having gained possession of the camp of the enemy , and observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp , sent the tenth legion as a relief to our men , who , when they had learned from the flight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was , and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were involved , left undone nothing to dispatch .
 every building , too , was to be enclosed by its own proper wall , not by one common to others
 he , after concluding the rest of his speech , and stating for what purpose he had come , told caesar that he had commands of a private nature for him from pompey ; that pompey wished to clear himself to caesar , lest he should impute those actions which he did for the republic , to a design of affronting him ; that he had ever preferred the interest of the state to his own private connections ; that caesar , too , for his own honor , ought to sacrifice his desires and resentment to the public good , and not vent his anger so violently against his enemies , lest in his hopes of injuring them , he should injure the republic . 
 messalina , though her peril took away all power of thought , promptly resolved to meet and face her husband , a course in which she had often found safety while she bade britannicus and octavia hasten to embrace their father
 beside the other usual accompaniments of war , his army was followed by a great number of camels laden with corn , to keep off famine as well as the enemy
 at the same time they heaped abuse on the commander they appealed to heaven and to the gods , and left nothing undone by which they might excite resentment and pity , alarm and rage
 to this was added the most exorbitant interest , as usually happens in times of war ; the whole sums being called in , on which occasion , they alleged that the delay of a single day was a donation . 
 but agrippina , who could not endure equality and loved to domineer , was with her masculine aspirations far removed from the frailties of women
 domitius , upon observing this , sent messengers well acquainted with the country , encouraged by a promise of being amply rewarded , with dispatches to pompey to apulia , to beg and entreat him to come to his assistance . 
 this entertainment , it is true , passed off without any notorious scandal
 but if a law were to be passed and a penalty imposed , those very same persons will cry out that the state is revolutionised , that ruin is plotted against all our most brilliant fashion , that not a citizen is safe from incrimination
 the island of the batavi was the appointed rendezvous , because of its easy landing-places , and its convenience for receiving the army and carrying the war across the river
it was necessary , at one and the same time , to procure timber , lay in supplies of corn , and raise also extensive fortifications , and the available troops were in consequence of this reduced in number , since they used to advance to some distance from the camp , and sometimes the gauls endeavored to attack our works , and to make a sally from the town by several gates and in great force .
 it will be less guilt to slay your commander than it is to be in revolt from the emperor
 our cavalry did not withstand their charge : but gave ground a little , upon which pompey's horse pressed them more vigorously , and began to file off in troops , and flank our army . 
 the senators unanimously exclaimed that the body ought to be borne on their shoulders to the funeral pile
 even those whose friends or relatives were away from home for quite a different reason , still trembled for them , and as it was not yet known who had been destroyed by the crash , suspense made the alarm more widespread
 between us , however , there will not be an equal distribution of the fruits of success or failure
 another with a diseased hand , at the counsel of the same god , prayed that the limb might feet the print of a caesar's foot
 after the conflict at actium , and when it became essential to peace , that all power should be centered in one man , these great intellects passed away
 when two of fabius's legions had , as was their constant practice , gone forth as the usual protection to the foragers , and had crossed the river , and the baggage , and all the horse were following them , on a sudden , from the weight of the cattle , and the mass of water , the bridge fell , and all the horse were cut off from the main army , which being known to petreius and afranius , from the timber and hurdles that were carried down the river , afranius immediately crossed his own bridge , which communicated between his camp and the town , with four legions and all the cavalry , and marched against fabius's two legions . 
 antonius from his success and high reputation was observed of all
 caesar had conceived hopes of ending the affair without an engagement , or without striking a blow , because he had cut off the enemy's supplies . 
 stung with the ignominy and with resentment , he pretended in public that he would go to caesar , but privately sent messengers to milo , who had murdered clodius , and had been condemned for it ; and having invited him into italy , because he had engaged the remains of the gladiators to his interest , by making them ample presents , he joined him , and sent him to thurinum to tamper with the shepherds . 
 the ordovices , shortly before agricola's arrival , had destroyed nearly the whole of a squadron of allied cavalry quartered in their territory
 for himself , he said , he had no forgiveness but for the victorious
 the emperor , however , himself stopped the consul's flattery , as extravagant
 he was conveyed back to his house , where , seemingly by way of preparing his defence for the next day , he wrote a few words , sealed the paper and handed it to a freedman
 this supplies sport to their children , rivalry to their youths even the aged keep it up horses are bequeathed along with the slaves , the dwelling-house , and the usual rights of inheritance
 they met in the place appointed by caesar . 
 it is vain to expect secrecy and fidelity from the varying tempers and bodily constitutions of such a host of accomplices
 but germanicus was gracious to his friends , temperate in his pleasures , the husband of one wife , with only legitimate children he was too no less a warrior , though rashness he had none , and , though after having cowed germany by his many victories , he was hindered from crushing it into subjection
the next day caesar , the tower being advanced , and the works which he had determined to raise being arranged , a violent storm arising , thought this no bad time for executing his designs , because he observed the guards arranged on the walls a little too negligently , and therefore ordered his own men to engage in their work more remissly , and pointed out what he wished to be done .
incited by this speech , they give a pledge and oath to one another , and hope that , when they have seized the sovereignty , they will , by means of the three most powerful and valiant nations , be enabled to obtain possession of the whole of gaul .
 mankind in the earliest age lived for a time without a single vicious impulse , without shame or guilt , and , consequently , without punishment and restraints
 civilis then stipulated for the plunder of the camp , and appointed guards who were to secure the treasure , the camp-followers , and the baggage , and accompany them as they departed , stripped of everything
 it would be ridiculous in me not to waive my claims to empire in favour of the man whose son i should adopt , were i myself emperor
 surprised , as he was , and many as were the thoughts which crowded on him , thoughts of peril from the emperor , of scorn from the barbarians , of ridicule from the allies , he said nothing but this , happy the roman generals of old , and gave the signal for retreat
 that there had been spies by his side for so many years , to note his looks , his sighs , and even his whispered thoughts , and that his grandfather could have heard read , and published all , was scarce credible but letters of attius , a centurion , and didymus , a freedman , openly exhibited the names of slave after slave who had respectively struck or scared drusus as he was quitting his chamber
all gaul is divided into three parts , one of which the belgae inhabit , the aquitani another , those who in their own language are called celts , in ours gauls , the third .
for as it happened by a remarkable chance , that he fell upon himself unguarded and unprepared , and that his arrival was seen by the people before the report or information of his arrival was carried thither ; so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that , although every implement of war which he was accustomed to have about him was seized , and his chariots and horses surprised , yet he himself escaped death .
 both these attacks were unexpected
when our soldiers , about 300 in number , had been drawn out of these two ships , and were marching to the camp , the morini , whom caesar , when setting forth for britain , had left in a state of peace , excited by the hope of spoil , at first surrounded them with a small number of men , and ordered them to lay down their arms , if they did not wish to be slain ; afterward however , when they , forming a circle , stood on their defense , a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled ; which being reported , caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as a relief to his men .
 besides , the enemy's cavalry began to surround us on both wings and to trample down our rear . 
 what name shall i give to this gathering
 i could wish that one of you were prevailed on to investigate and describe to us the reasons of this vast difference
 if his sentiments displease them , they reject them with murmurs
 soon he began to waver , supporting vitellius in his public dispatches and edicts , vespasian in his secret correspondence , and intending to hold by the one or the other according as they might succeed
 vitellius has but a few cohorts , and they are alarmed by gloomy tidings from every quarter
 and elsewhere the river's narrow channel and profound depth which no line of the explorer can penetrate
the day after , caesar , after breaking open the gates , which there was no one then to defend , and sending in our soldiers , sold the whole spoil of that town .
 pompey applauded his proposal , and took the same oath ; nor did any person present hesitate to take it . 
 he addressed to the several legions appropriate appeals
 caesar replied , that either to complain or sue for mercy became no man less than him : for that every other person had done their duty : himself , in having declined to engage on favorable terms , in an advantageous situation and time , that all things tending to a peace might be totally unembarrassed : his army , in having preserved and protected the men whom they had in their power , notwithstanding the injuries which they had received , and the murder of their comrades ; and even afranius's soldiers , who of themselves treated about concluding a peace , by which they thought that they would secure the lives of all . 
moreover , even as to laboring cattle , in which the gauls take the greatest pleasure , and which they procure at a great price , the germans do not employ such as are imported , but those poor and ill-shaped animals , which belong to their country ; these , however , they render capable of the greatest labor by daily exercise .
 and as his ways were quite alien from theirs they hated alike what was bad and what was good in him
while these things are going on , and all our men engaged , the rest of the britons , who were in the fields , departed .
 germanicus' answer as to the alliance between rome and parthia was dignified
 one of the aged priests , who was desired to interpret the language of his country , related how once there had dwelt in thebes seven hundred thousand men of military age , and how with such an army king rhamses conquered libya , ethiopia , media , persia , bactria , and scythia , and held under his sway the countries inhabited by the syrians , armenians , and their neighbours , the cappadocians , from the bithynian to the lycian sea

 here raged battle and death
 when subius flavus at his side asked him by a sign whether he should draw his sword in the middle of the trial and perpetrate the fatal deed , rufus refused , and checked the man's impulse as he was putting his hand to his sword-hilt
 an assessment was made of gaul by quintus volusius , sextius africanus , and trebellius maximus there was a rivalry , on the score of rank , between volusius and africanus
that he was the only one out of all the state of the aedui , who could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as hostages .
 he was followed to this place by cerialis , whose forces had now been doubled by the arrival of the 2nd , 6th , and 14th legions
 of this same territory , the ampsivarii now possessed themselves , a tribe more powerful not only from their numbers , but from having the sympathy of the neighbouring peoples , as they had been expelled by the chauci and had to beg , as homeless outcasts , a secure exile
 after these transactions , domitius , hoping to allure scipio to a battle , pretended to be obliged to change his position through want of corn , and having given the signal for decamping , advanced about three miles , and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place , concealed from the enemy's view . 
 the consul servilius informed the senate of his proceedings , who passed a decree that caelius should be removed from the management of the republic . 
 when they were thus roused and were demanding battle , their chiefs led them down into a plain named idistavisus
 but when the world had been subdued , when all rival kings and cities had been destroyed , and men had leisure to covet wealth which they might enjoy in security , the early conflicts between the patricians and the people were kindled into flame
 the same fate was intended for vocula , but he assumed the dress of a slave , and escaped unrecognized in the darkness
 however , as i was just saying , the boys are taken to schools in which it is hard to tell whether the place itself , or their fellow-scholars , or the character of their studies , do their minds most harm
 in answer to this , antonius primus , who was the most energetic promoter of the war , declared that prompt action would be advantageous to themselves , and fatal to vitellius
 he likewise restored to their former condition the praetors and tribunes , first submitting the question to the people some persons condemned for bribery at the elections , by virtue of pompey's law , at the time when pompey kept his legions quartered in the city these trials were finished in a single day , one judge hearing the merits , and another pronouncing the sentences , because they had offered their service to him in the beginning of the civil war , if he chose to accept them ; setting the same value on them as if he had accepted them , because they had put themselves in his power . 
 in every one's mouth was the name of rubellius blandus , who inherited through his mother the high nobility of the julian family
 nor did the people of reate remain silent they remonstrated against the closing up of the veline lake , where it empties itself into the nar , as it would burst in a flood on the entire neighbourhood
 to these was added a collection of highwaymen , and freebooters , from syria , and the province of cilicia , and the adjacent countries . 
 this is quite alien to the propriety of our day
 caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls : but being cautioned by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered trenches , they halted , and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long circuit , they reached the port , and captured with their long boats and small craft two of pompey's ships , full of soldiers , which had struck against caesar's moles . 
 roscius , the praetor , conferred with caesar almost in the same words , and on the same subject , and declared that pompey had empowered him to do so . 
 sejanus however pacified him , not out of love for gallus , but rather to wait the result of the emperor's wavering mood , knowing , as he did , that , though slow in forming his purpose , yet having once broken through his reserve , he would follow up harsh words with terrible deeds
 jersualem is the capital there stood a temple of immense wealth first came the city with its fortifications , then the royal palace , then , within the innermost defences , the temple itself
 the legions were drawn up in front of the intrenched camp his victory would be vastly more glorious if won without the loss of roman blood , and he would have a reserve in case of repulse
the most civilized of all these nations are they who inhabit kent , which is entirely a maritime district , nor do they differ much from the gallic customs .
was with difficulty sustained for that day .
 mucianus ejected him from his office , and , not to leave him without consolation , made him superintendent of the sale of corn
although the army was distressed by the greatest want of corn , through the poverty of the boii , the apathy of the aedui , and the burning of the houses , to such a degree , that for several days the soldiers were without corn , and satisfied their extreme hunger with cattle driven from the remote villages ; yet no language was heard from them unworthy of the majesty of the roman people and their former victories .
 thus they were able to break the thin line of our soldiers
 his sister , calvina , was banished from italy
 immediately the light infantry and cavalry , without knowing whither they were being led , were hurried along at quick march
 but this sudden impulse was checked by the senators , who , having first heartily praised the grandeur of his conception , pointed out that the dissolution of the empire must ensue if the revenues which supported the state were to be diminished
 crying out that he was concealing the spoil of gaul , the gold of the men of vienna , the hire of their own toils , they ransacked his baggage , and probed with javelins and lances the walls of the general's tent and the very ground beneath
these , on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy , did not then wait for any command from caesar , but of themselves executed whatever appeared proper .
 with the growth of the empire private wealth too , he said , had increased , and there was nothing new in this , but it accorded with the fashions of the earliest antiquity
 but the most portentous spectacle of all was vitellius himself , ignorant of military matters and without forethought in his plans , even asking others about the order of march , about the business of reconnoitring , and the discretion to be used in pushing on or protracting the campaign , betraying in his countenance and gait his alarm at every fresh piece of intelligence , and finally drinking to intoxication
 pompey , because he was encamped on a hill , drew up his army at the very foot of it , ever in expectation , as may be conjectured , that caesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous situation . 
the enemy being alarmed by the suddenness of the attack , were dislodged from the wall and towers , and drew up , in form of a wedge , in the market place and the open streets , with this intention that , if an attack should be made on any side , they should fight with their line drawn up to receive it .
 to be known even to his freedmen and hall-porters was thought something very grand
caesar hastens to share in the action .
 you need not reckon for how long , for it is peculiarly difficult to be moderate with that prosperity which you think you will not long enjoy
 however , he did not desist from his attempt , but hoped by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able to bear up against the violence of the storm ; and although we were carried beyond dyrrachium , by the violence of the wind , he nevertheless continued to chase us . 
when the mountain had been gained , and our men were advancing up , the boii and tulingi , who with about 15 , 000 men closed the enemy's line of march and served as a guard to their rear , having assailed our men on the exposed flank as they advanced to surround them ; upon seeing which , the helvetii who had betaken themselves to the mountain , began to press on again and renew the battle .
 but when he heard that officers of the commissariat had been again sent to novesium , and that the infantry detached as an escort were advancing just as if it were a time of profound peace , with but few soldiers round the standards , the arms stowed away in the wagons , and all wandering about at their pleasure , he attacked them in regular form , having first sent on troops to occupy the bridges and the defiles in the road
 the tribunes and centurions followed their example ; the soldiers were brought out by centuries , and took the same oath . 
 but caesar applauded the soldiers of attius , set pupius at liberty , returned thanks to the people of auximum , and promised to be grateful for their conduct . 
 many a man has behaved in a province quite otherwise than was hoped or feared of him
 towards the close of the year died two distinguished men , asinius agrippa and quintus haterius agrippa was of illustrious rather than ancient ancestry , which his career did not disgrace haterius was of a senatorian family and famous for his eloquence while he lived , though the monuments which remain of his genius are not admired as of old
for the present , therefore , inasmuch as he knew that cicero was released from the blockade , and thought that he might , on that account , relax his speed , he halted there and fortifies a camp in the most favorable position he can .
 he even pretended to fear to make himself keener in desire
 a woman had quelled a mutiny which the sovereign's name could not check
 meanwhile the rumoured loss of the fleet stirred the germans to hope for war , as it did caesar to hold them down
 but for these matters , he allowed no more time than was necessary for a person in haste . 
 having asked who they were , when they were told that this honour was granted to envoys from those nations which were distinguished for their bravery and their friendship to rome , they exclaimed that no men on earth surpassed the germans in arms or in loyalty
 but chief strength was on the rhine , as a defence alike against germans and gauls , and numbered eight legions
 silius was not unconscious of his wickedness and his peril
 the common soldiers remained obstinately faithful to vitellius , till priscus and alfenius , deserting the camp and returning to vitellius , relieved all from any shame they might feel at being traitors
 but that our friendship and union may be established for ever , we require of you to strip your city of its walls , which are the bulwarks of slavery even savage animals , if you keep them in confinement , forget their natural courage we require of you to massacre all romans within your territory
 he sent marcus antonius thither , with five cohorts of the eighth legion the inhabitants , as soon as they saw our standards , threw open their gates , and all the people , both citizens and soldiers , went out to meet and welcome antonius . 
 he yielded , and a year and six months were granted , within which every one was to settle his private accounts conformably to the requirements of the law
 during this commotion , aponius saturnius , governor of moesia , ventured on a most atrocious act he despatched a centurion to murder tettius julianus , the legate of the 7th legion , to gratify a private pique , which he concealed beneath the appearance of party zeal
 caesar having encouraged his troops , though they were greatly exhausted by incessant labor the whole day , and night was now approaching , by throwing up works cut off the communication between the river and the mountain , that the enemy might not get water in the night . 
 hence , even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment , there arose a feeling of compassion
 one of them , which continued the voyage and did not obey kalenus's command , because it carried no troops , but was private property , bore away for oricum , and was taken by bibulus , who spared neither slaves nor free men , nor even children ; but put all to the sword . 
 turesis and his band waited for night , not without the knowledge of our general
 being acquainted with the nature of the country , he left behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge , the camp , and all his baggage , and the next day set off in person for ilerda , with all his forces drawn up in three lines , and halted just before the camp of afranius , and having remained there a short time under arms , he offered him battle on equal terms . 
 we may bear with the defence put forward by men who thought it better to destroy others than to come into peril themselves
 his name was put at the head of despatches and edicts , but the real authority was in the hands of mucianus , with this exception , that domitian ventured on several acts of power , at the instigation of his friends , or at his own caprice
 arminius in his infatuation and ignorance was taking to himself the glory which belonged to another , for he had treacherously surprised three unofficered legions and a general who had not an idea of perfidy , to the great hurt of germany and to his own disgrace , since his wife and his son were still enduring slavery
 a question was then raised in the senate by arruntius and ateius whether , in order to restrain the inundations of the tiber , the rivers and lakes which swell its waters should be diverted from their courses
 on the whole , if you review all our wars , never has one been finished in a shorter time than that with the gauls
 the story becomes at this point more marvellous , and relates that the god of his own will conveyed himself on board the fleet , which had been brought close to shore , and , wonderful to say , vast as was the extent of sea that they traversed , they arrived at alexandria on the third day
 whereas if they fled , more forests , deeper swamps , and a savage foe awaited them but if they were victorious , glory and renown would be theirs
 at length , sending some horsemen , he ascertained that at that very instant the man had been eighty miles distant
 spare your ears they said , taunts and revilings
 as tidings of the mutiny in germany were arriving with daily increasing frequency , while the country was ready to receive and to credit all intelligence that had an unfavourable character , the senate came to a resolution to send deputies to the german armies
 but of the tribunes and centurions , several voluntarily remained with him , and he afterward treated them with great respect . 
 they quietly watched the opening of the campaign , but when they heard that italy was in a blaze of war , and that the whole empire was divided against itself , they stormed the winter quarters of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry , and occupied both banks of the danube
 agricola , made known to posterity by history and tradition , will live for ever
then they , according to their custom , shout out victory , and raise their war-cry , and , making an attack on our men , break their ranks .
to the utmost vigilance he adds the utmost rigor of authority ; and by the severity of his punishments brings over the wavering : for on the commission of a greater crime he puts the perpetrators to death by fire and every sort of tortures ; for a slighter cause , he sends home the offenders with their ears cut off , or one of their eyes put out , that they may be an example to the rest , and frighten others by the severity of their punishment .
there was left one way , through the sequani , by which , on account of its narrowness , they could not pass without the consent of the sequani .
 and yet augustus had appointed germanicus , drusus's offspring , to the command of eight legions on the rhine , and required tiberius to adopt him , although tiberius had a son , now a young man , in his house
 they inform them that , if the turret had entirely fallen down , the soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it , in hopes of getting spoil . 
 her character she never spared , making no distinction between a husband and a paramour , while she was never a slave to her own passion or to that of her lover
 they did not , however , resort to open violence , but chose an opportunity for a treacherous attack
he pillages and burns the town , gives the booty to the soldiers , then leads his army over the loire , and marches into the territories of the bituriges .
 a massacre then began
 vologeses meanwhile , though he had heard that the roads were blocked by paetus , here with infantry , there with cavalry , did not alter his plan , but drove off the latter by the menace of an attack , and crushed the legionaires , only one centurion of whom , tarquitius crescens , dared to defend a tower in which he was keeping guard he had often sallied out , and cut to pieces such of the barbarians as came close up to the walls , till he was overwhelmed with volleys of firebrands
in the mean time our soldiers sustained the attack of the enemy , and fought most valiantly for more than four hours , and , receiving but few wounds themselves , slew several of them .
 what will be the result if gaul throws off the yoke
 at the same time i thought that any influence i possess ought not to be destroyed by incessant protests , wishing that it might remain unimpaired , should the state ever need my counsels
 near his tent , a barbarian of no mean rank was discovered with a dagger , who divulged under torture the whole method of the plot , its contrivance by himself , and his associates the men who under a show of friendship planned the treachery , were convicted and punished
 the suspension of business then ceased , and men went back to their occupations drusus was sent to the armies of illyricum , amidst an universal eagerness to exact vengeance on piso , and ceaseless complaints that he was meantime roaming through the delightful regions of asia and achaia , and was weakening the proofs of his guilt by an insolent and artful procrastination
 they make a show of freedom , to overturn the empire
 in remonstrating too against the influence of marcus lepidus and lucius arruntius , with whom he had disputes on many matters , he had added the remark , they will have the senate's support
 a sudden attack , however , was made by the infantry under the command of sextilius
this side extends about 500 miles .
 if all went well with them , what city could they select as the seat of empire
 these acts , as being welcome to the state , were undertaken with hearty gladness by the imperial censor
 by a strong bodily effort , however , and a furious rush of his horse , he made his way through them , having smeared his face with his blood , that he might not be known
 in this flight one fabius , a pelignian common soldier in curio's army , pursuing the enemy's rear , with a loud voice shouted to varus by his name , and often called him , so that he seemed to be one of his soldiers , who wished to speak to him and give him advice . 
 this was the cause of his destruction
 undoubtedly in his speeches he fell short of his reputation , even by the admission of his admirers
 the armies of rhaetia made no delay in at once joining vitellius , and even in britain there was no hesitation
 there were persons who charged tuscus and his guests , and blaesus more vindictively than any , with passing their days in merriment while the emperor was sick
the aedui , as they could not defend themselves and their possessions against them , send embassadors to caesar to ask assistance , that they had at all times so well deserved of the roman people , that their fields ought not to have been laid waste-their children carried off into slavery-their towns stormed , almost within sight of our army .
 but heaven is on the side of a righteous vengeance
 to the langobardi , on the contrary , their scanty numbers are a distinction
 but the honour of a noble house was further increased by an annual grant of five hundred thousand sesterces on which messala might support virtuous poverty
 the legions had their assigned places , the fifth on the right wing , the twenty-first on the left , the men of the first to lead the van , the twentieth to repel pursuers
in the mean time those who had gone to the other part of the town to defend it , as we have mentioned above , at first , aroused by hearing the shouts , and , afterward , by frequent accounts , that the town was in possession of the romans , sent forward their cavalry , and hastened in larger numbers to that quarter .
 half of them have their backs covered with wounds half are once again exposing limbs battered by waves and storms to a foe full of fury , and to hostile deities , with no hope of advantage
 this circumstance was known to pompey , being told to him by the allobrogian deserters , and proved of great disadvantage to us for when our cohorts of the ninth legion were on guard by the sea-side , pompey's army arrived suddenly by break of day , and their approach was a surprise to our men , and at the same time , the soldiers that came by sea , cast their darts on the front rampart ; and the ditches were filled with fascines : and the legionary soldiers terrified those that defended the inner rampart , by applying the scaling ladders , and by engines and weapons of all sorts , and a vast multitude of archers poured round upon them from every side . 
 so many thousand troops , comprising the picked men and horses of the army , had they been under the direction of a different general , would have been quite equal even to aggressive operations
 the number of his statues , or of the places in which they were honoured , could not easily be computed when a golden shield of remarkable size was voted him as a leader among orators , tiberius declared that he would dedicate to him one of the usual kind , similar to the rest , for in eloquence , he said , there was no distinction of rank , and it was a sufficient glory for him to be classed among ancient writers
 immediately troops were despatched to draw the enemy from his position by appearing in his front , others , to hem in his rear and open the ground
 to these words the emperor added embraces and kisses for he was formed by nature and trained by habit to veil his hatred under delusive flattery
 so again the young , those whose studies are on the anvil , who go after the orators with a view to their own progress , are anxious not merely to hear but also to carry back home some brilliant passage worthy of remembrance
 hence no labour was bestowed on the ground or on the defences
 in the following year tiberius held his third , germanicus his second , consulship
 traitors and deserters are hanged on trees
 such men had a host of clients , even among foreign nations the magistrates , when leaving rome for the provinces , showed them respect , and courted their favour as soon as they returned the prætorship and the consulship seemed to offer themselves to them , and even when they were out of office , they were not out of power , for they swayed both people and senate with their counsels and influence
 in the summer in which he entered on the sixth year of his office , his operations embraced the states beyond bodotria , and , as he dreaded a general movement among the remoter tribes , as well as the perils which would beset an invading army , he explored the harbours with a fleet , which , at first employed by him as an integral part of his force , continued to accompany him the spectacle of war thus pushed on at once by sea and land was imposing while often infantry , cavalry , and marines , mingled in the same encampment and joyously sharing the same meals , would dwell on their own achievements and adventures , comparing , with a soldier's boastfulness , at one time the deep recesses of the forest and the mountain with the dangers of waves and storms , or , at another , battles by land with victories over the ocean
there was a hill opposite the town , at the very foot of that mountain , strongly fortified and precipitous on every side : however , caesar set out from the camp in the silence of night , and dislodging the garrison before succor could come from the town , he got possession of the place and posted two legions there , and drew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet broad , so that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any sudden attack of the enemy .
 he had often yielded to antonius , while he was taking vengeance on his father's murderers , often also to lepidus
 with her were involved as her accomplices and paramours cneius domitius , vibius marsus and lucius arruntius
 but the influence of an example outlives the individual character
 by forty-five years of obedience , by my association with you in the consulate , as one who formerly won the esteem of the divine augustus , your father , as one who is your friend and will never hereafter ask a favour , i implore you to save my unhappy son
 caedicia , the wife of scaevinus , and caesonius maximus were forbidden to live in italy , their penalty being the only proof they had of having been accused
 it was accordingly usual with our ancestors , when a lad was being prepared for public speaking , as soon as he was fully trained by home discipline , and his mind was stored with culture , to have him taken by his father , or his relatives to the orator who held the highest rank in the state
 to limit the number of their children or to destroy any of their subsequent offspring is accounted infamous , and good habits are here more effectual than good laws elsewhere
 about a third part of their army being dismissed in two days , caesar ordered two of his legions , to go before , the rest to follow the vanquished enemy ; that they should encamp at a small distance from each other . 
at an earlier period perpetual wars had taken place between him and the other states ; but , greatly alarmed by our arrival , the britons had placed him over the whole war and the conduct of it .
 this conduct he counted worthy of his ancestors and of the cassian family which had won renown even in those countries
 neither of these statements would i positively affirm
 it had been the intention of the cherusci to help the chatti
 the fortunate lot of the semnones strengthens this belief
 i have related in sequence the events of two summer-campaigns , as a relief to the reader's mind from our miseries at home
 africa displayed the same obedience , carthage taking the lead in that city crescens , one of nero's freedmen for in evil times even this class makes itself a power in the state , without waiting for the sanction of the proconsul , vipstanus apronianus , had given an entertainment to the populace by way of rejoicings for the new reign , and the people , with extravagant zeal , hastened to make the usual demonstrations of joy
ho thought that these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him before he provoked him to war ; lest he , despairing of safety , should either proceed to conceal himself in the territories of the menapii , or should be driven to coalesce with the germans beyond the rhine .
 were all other matters in every department of the empire as admirable as if thrasea and not nero had the direction of them
 on the one hand , the provincials from long use felt a pleasure in the companionship of the soldiers , with whom many of them were connected by friendship or relationship on the other , the soldiers from the long duration of their service loved the well-known and familiar camp as a home
the breadth of this hercynian forest , which has been referred to above , is to a quick traveler , a journey of nine days .
 or , if you think all this too fabulous and imaginary , at least you grant me that homer has as much honour with posterity as demosthenes , and that the fame of euripides or sophocles is bounded by a limit not narrower than that of lysias or hyperides
 while he was hurrying on without caution , as against a vanquished enemy , the vitellianists , who had disposed some infantry among their cavalry , met him
 m cluvius rufus , who had left his government in spain , came up with vitellius after his departure from lugdunum he wore a look of joy and congratulation , but he was anxious at heart , for he knew that he was the object of accusations
 a sudden cry was raised that the 14th legion had retraced its steps , and was advancing to the attack
for dispatch of lading , and for drawing them on shore , he makes them a little lower than those which we have been accustomed to use in our sea ; and that so much the more , because he knew that , on account of the frequent changes of the tide , less swells occurred there ; for the purpose of transporting burdens and a great number of horses , a little broader than those which we use in other seas .
 i do not wish my remarks to be taken as implying that i would deter from poetry those to whom nature has denied the orator's talent , if only they can amuse their leisure and push themselves into fame by this branch of culture
 a contest then arose about the election of a praetor in the room of vipstanus gallus , whom death had removed
 our men , taking advantage of fortune's kindness , for they were still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet , if the wind abated , having come near a port , called nymphaeum , about three miles beyond lissus , put into it this port is protected from a south-west wind , but is not secure against a south wind ; and thought less danger was to be apprehended from the storm than from the enemy . 
but the enemy , even in the last hope of safety , displayed such great courage , that when the foremost of them had fallen , the next stood upon them prostrate , and fought from their bodies ; when these were overthrown , and their corpses heaped up together , those who survived cast their weapons against our men , as from a mound , and returned our darts which had fallen short between ; so that it ought not to be concluded , that men of such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very broad river , ascend very high banks , and come up to a very disadvantageous place ; since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy , although in themselves very difficult .
 public opinion is not always mistaken
 i will not name any one , as i think it enough to have pointed at a class
 with the old patrician family of the sulpicii this quirinus , who was born in the town of lanuvium , was quite unconnected
 besides , a capitulation was expected
 he wavered in purpose , dreading at one moment the anger of the god , terrified at another by the threats and opposition of the people
from this town a bridge extends to the helvetii .
 lucretius and attius leaped off the walls . 
 he himself , on hearing that a fort on the river luppia was being besieged , led six legions to the spot
 shewing how from one point the columns of the legions had rushed to the attack
caesar , being informed of these things by crassus , since he was so far distant himself , orders ships of war to be built in the mean time on the river loire , which flows into the ocean ; rowers to be raised from the province ; sailors and pilots to be provided .
 yet if the auxiliary troops and allies were to be armed against the retiring legions , civil war was in fact begun
 their minds had passed from apprehension to confidence of success
 hilarius , the emperor's freedman , had indeed brought this charge against him , that on hearing of the contest for the throne between vitellius and otho , he had made an attempt to secure power for himself , and to obtain possession of spain , and that with this view he had not headed his passports with the name of any emperor
 and indeed i know , as facts , that the julii came from alba , the coruncanii from camerium , the porcii from tusculum , and not to inquire too minutely into the past , that new members have been brought into the senate from etruria and lucania and the whole of italy , that italy itself was at last extended to the alps , to the end that not only single persons but entire countries and tribes might be united under our name
 as the numbers were excessive , he divided the business of enrolment between the consuls
 accordingly they were carried off to prison , the boy , aware of his impending doom , and the little girl , who was so unconscious that she continually asked what was her offence , and whither she was being dragged , saying that she would do so no more , and a childish chastisement was enough for her correction
they will own my manhood
 the troops formed themselves in cohorts and companies , for they could not deploy into line
 cheering on his men to offer battle in the open plain , he drew up his line in front of his intrenchments
 many voted for putting to death men so turbulent and faithless , stained too with the blood of their generals
 if first , i shall know what to follow
fortune accomplishes much , not only in other matters , but also in the art of war .
 what town puts itself under our protection but one harassed by its neighbours or by strife at home
 what if there were to rise up the remembrance of those who fell in rome's citadel and at her altar by the hands of these same barbarians ! let them enjoy indeed the title of citizens , but let them not vulgarise the distinctions of the senate and the honours of office
for this object he selected fitting emissaries , by whose subtle pleading or private friendship , each of the nobles could be most easily influenced .
 with them a lengthened shadow fell from men and horses , and the enemy's missiles , incorrectly aimed at what seemed the substance , fell short , while the vitellianists , who had the light shining on their faces , were unconsciously exposed to an enemy who were , so to speak , concealed while they aimed
 neither samnite nor carthaginian , neither spain nor gaul , not even the parthians , have given us more frequent warnings
 his fleet remained there on the left bank of the stream , and it was a blunder that he did not have it brought up the river
 but fortune who exerts a powerful influence as well in other matters , as especially in war , effects great changes from trifling causes , as happened at this time . 
 it commanded too a prospect of the most lovely bay , till vesuvius , bursting into flames , changed the face of the country
 to this was added the yet more appalling horror of poppaea beholding the severed head which was conveyed to rome
 our soldiers made it a pretext for carlessness , as if all fighting was over , and the enemy were biding their time
 he demanded soldiers : they sent them . 
 nero was conveyed into the camp , and having first spoken suitably to the occasion and promised a donative after the example of his father's bounty , he was unanimously greeted as emperor
 to retreat south of the bodotria , and to retire rather than to be driven out , was the advice of timid pretenders to prudence , when agricola learnt that the enemy's attack would be made with more than one army
 it was privately discussed whether piso should go with them to give them a more imposing appearance they , it was said , would bring with them the authority of the senate , he the majesty of the caesar
 tiridates first dwelt much on the nobility of his race , but went on to speak in a tone of moderation
 those who survived tiberius , those who survived caligula , thought the same
 a request from the spaniards that they might erect a temple to augustus in the colony of tarraco was granted , and a precedent thus given for all the provinces
in that legion there were two very brave men , centurions , who were now approaching the first ranks , t .
 before the hostile lines engaged , the vitellianists began to retreat , but celsus , aware of the stratagem , kept his men back
 paullinus alleged that he feared the effects of so much additional toil and so long a march , apprehending that the vitellianists might issue fresh from their camp , and attack his wearied troops , who , once thrown into confusion , would have no reserves to fall back upon
 at last , reckless even of health , a large portion of them quartered themselves in the notoriously pestilential neighbourhood of the vatican
 the soldiers seized their arms , bared their swords , and , mounted on their horses , made for the city and the palace
 so evident it is , that we can neither perish , nor be saved , except together
 on herod's death , one simon , without waiting for the approbation of the emperor , usurped the title of king
 at length several stones being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the musculus , part of it fell down suddenly , and the rest , as if following it , leaned forward . 
 and what most stimulates their courage is , that their squadrons or battalions , instead of being formed by chance or by a fortuitous gathering , are composed of families and clans close by them , too , are those dearest to them , so that they hear the shrieks of women , the cries of infants
 now i would have an orator , like a rich and grand householder , not merely be sheltered by a roof sufficient to keep off rain and wind , but by one to delight the sight and the eye
 this , and the like , he was always saying , and he would embrace britannicus , expressing earnest wishes for his speedy arrival at a mature age , and would raise his hand , now to heaven , now to the young prince , with entreaty that as he grew up , he would drive out his father's enemies and also take vengeance on the murderers of his mother
 at antioch gold and silver money was coined , everything being vigorously carried on in its appointed place by properly qualified agents
 even iron is not plentiful with them , as we infer from the character of their weapons
 marcus rufus , the quaestor , pursued him with twelve ships , which curio had brought from sicily as convoy to the merchantmen , and seeing a ship left on the shore , he brought her off by a towing rope , and returned with his fleet to curio . 
 nor was any man so negligent or drowsy as to sleep that night . 
 in soil and climate , in the disposition , temper , and habits of its population , it differs but little from britain
that matter being determined on , marching out of their camp at the second watch , with great noise and confusion , in no fixed order , nor under any command , since each sought for himself the foremost place in the journey , and hastened to reach home , they made their departure appear very like a flight .
 they had no leader , for verginius had been withdrawn on the pretext of his friendship with the emperor
 it resembles the sea , but is more nauseous in taste
 meanwhile civilis blockaded the old camp
 they his officers , exerting boldness and courage , aided by the instructions of marcus antonius , and fusius kalenus , and animated by the soldiers strongly encouraging them , and declining no danger for caesar's safety , having got a southerly wind , weighed anchor , and the next day were carried past apollonia and dyrrachium , and being seen from the continent , quintus coponius , who commanded the rhodian fleet at dyrrachium , put out of the port with his ships ; and when they had almost come up with us , in consequence of the breeze dying away , the south wind sprang up afresh , and rescued us . 
 in the senate all the customary honours , which had been devised during the long reigns of other emperors , were forthwith decreed
 caesar added these cohorts to his own army , and sent attius away in safety . 
 on the father's side he was descended from flavus , the brother of arminius
their mode of fighting with their chariots is this : firstly , they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels ; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse , leap from their chariots and engage on foot .
on the day following , before the enemy could recover from their terror and flight , caesar led his army into the territories of the suessiones , which are next to the remi , and having accomplished a long march , hastens to the town named noviodunum .
 such zeal , he thought , could not be guileless
on this circumstance being announced , caesar orders his cavalry also to form three divisions and charge the enemy .
 they had been joined by the 11th legion , which at first had hesitated , but now in the hour of success felt alarm at having stood aloof
in short , that these were the same men whom the helvetii , in frequent encounters , not only in their own territories , but also in theirs , have generally vanquished , and yet can not have been a match for our army .
when night had put an end to the assault , iccius remus , who was then in command of the town , one of the remi , a man of the highest rank and influence among his people , and one of those who had come to caesar as embassador for peace , sends messengers to him , that , unless assistance were sent to him he could not hold out any longer .
some of them let themselves down from the walls by their hands , and surrendered to our soldiers .
 i am not unaware that people at entertainments and social gatherings condemn all this and demand some restriction
 her father likewise , an illustrious roman knight , and her brother , an ex-praetor , seeing their doom was near , destroyed themselves
under these difficulties two things proved of advantage ; the skill and experience of the soldiers , because , having been trained by former engagements , they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done , as conveniently as receive information from others ; and that caesar had forbidden his several legates to depart from the works and their respective legions , before the camp was fortified .
 fired with indignation , he exclaimed , it is not flaccus or vocula , whom you are thus abandoning
 away then with the excuse of quiet and safety , when you are deliberately choosing a more doughty adversary
while caesar was in winter quarters in hither gaul , as we have shown above , frequent reports were brought to him , and he was also informed by letters from labienus , that all the belgae , who we have said are a third part of gaul , were entering into a confederacy against the roman people , and giving hostages to one another ; that the reasons of the confederacy were these-first , because they feared that , after all gaul was subdued , our army would be led against them ; secondly , because they were instigated by several of the gauls ; some of whom as they had been unwilling that the germans should remain any longer in gaul , so they were dissatisfied that the army of the roman people should pass the winter in it , and settle there ; and others of them , from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition , were anxious for a revolution ; by several , also , because the government in gaul was generally seized upon by the more powerful persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops , and they could less easily effect this object under our dominion .
 while the same consuls were in office , an atrocious crime was committed in nearer spain by a peasant of the termestine tribe
 for he had admitted the children of agrippa , caius and lucius , into the house of the caesars and before they had yet laid aside the dress of boyhood he had most fervently desired , with an outward show of reluctance , that they should be entitled princes of the youth , and be consuls-elect
 as soon as he touched on the mutiny and asked what had become of soldierly obedience , of the glory of ancient discipline , whither they had driven their tribunes and centurions , they all bared their bodies and taunted him with the scars of their wounds and the marks of the lash
there is a river the saône , which flows through the territories of the aedui and sequani into the rhône with such incredible slowness , that it can not be determined by the eye in which direction it flows .
 at batavodurum the german troops tried to break down the bridge partly built
 still , if the hesitation of augustus is to influence us , how much stronger is the fact that he bestowed his daughter on marcus agrippa , then on myself
 germanicus , too , that he might be the better known , took his helmet off his head and begged his men to follow up the slaughter , as they wanted not prisoners , and the utter destruction of the nation would be the only conclusion of the war
 among the troops from germany the panic was particularly great for they believed that this separation marked them out for slaughter
 for as soon as the customs were swept away , there would follow a demand for the abolition of the direct taxes
 having publicly praised his victorious troops , caesar raised a pile of arms with the proud inscription , the army of tiberius caesar , after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the rhine and the elbe , has dedicated this monument to mars , jupiter , and augustus
 induced by these motives , early in the night he sent all his cavalry to the enemy's camp near the river bagrada , of which sabura , of whom we have already spoken , was the commander . 
 caesar calling his legions off from their work , and ordering the horse to hold themselves in readiness , marshaled his army : for to appear to decline an engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldiers and the general voice , would have been attended with great disadvantage . 
 most mourners could hardly bear even the soothing words of kinsfolk or to look on the light of day
he gives a commission to the senones and the other gauls who were neighbors of the belgae , to learn what is going on among them , and inform him of these matters .
 i will not attempt to deny one thing
 piso neither said nor did anything else in public in the following four days which intervened between his adoption and his death
 for all this nero was unanimously saluted emperor , and by the senate's decree a thanksgiving was held statues also , arches and successive consulships were voted to him , and among the holy days were to be included the day on which the victory was won , that on which it was announced , and that on which the motion was brought forward other proposals too of a like kind were carried , on a scale so extravagant , that caius cassius , after having assented to the rest of the honours , argued that if the gods were to be thanked for the bountiful favours of fortune , even a whole year would not suffice for thanksgivings , and therefore there ought to be a classification of sacred and business-days , that so they might observe divine ordinances and yet not interfer with human affairs
 even granting that the deaths of cassius and of the bruti were sacrifices to a hereditary enmity though duty requires us to waive private feuds for the sake of the public welfare , still pompeius had been deluded by the phantom of peace , and lepidus by the mask of friendship
 it is forbidden to pour blood on the altar
 as neither crime nor accuser appeared , nero , being thus unable to assume the semblance of a judge , had recourse to the sheer might of despotism , and despatched gerellanus , a tribune , with a cohort of soldiers , and with orders to forestall the designs of the consul , to seize what he might call his fortress , and crush his train of chosen youths for vestinus had a house towering over the forum , and a host of handsome slaves of the same age
 all these motions valerius asiaticus , consul elect , proposed
 against him were the veteran troops drawn up in ranks and with reserves , a formidable soldiery on one side , a formidable position on the other
 both were shameless , infamous , and intractable , and were rivals in vice as much as in the advantages they had derived from fortune
this he sends written in greek characters , lest the letter being intercepted , our measures should be discovered by the enemy .
the town wall was 1200 paces distant from the plain and foot of the ascent , in a straight line , if no gap intervened ; whatever circuit was added to this ascent , to make the hill easy , increased the length of the route .
 what the compensation for so great a disaster
 thus it became commonly known that the place stood empty with no similitude of gods within , and that the shrine had nothing to reveal
 look again at the poet's lot , with its delightful companionships
therefore , having laid waste all their country , having burned their villages and houses , caesar led back his army and stationed them in winter quarters among the aulerci and lexovii , and the other states which had made war upon him last .
 otho however received the prediction as the words of wisdom and the intimation of destiny , with that inclination so natural to the human mind readily to believe in the mysterious
 he strengthened the hitherto moderate powers of his office by concentrating the cohorts scattered throughout the capital into one camp , so that they might all receive orders at the same moment , and that the sight of their numbers and strength might give confidence to themselves , while it would strike terror into the citizens
 civilis was on the field , trusting quite as much to the faults of his adversaries as to the valour of his own troops
 he entrusted to the batavians the care of the machines and the vast siege-works , and when the transrhenane tribes clamoured for battle , he bade them go and cut through the ramparts , and , if repulsed , renew the struggle
 brought before the tribunal , silius sought neither defence nor delay , but begged that his death might be hastened
cassivellaunus , when this battle was reported to him as so many losses had been sustained , and his territories laid waste , being alarmed most of all by the desertion of the states , sends embassadors to caesar about a surrender through the mediation of commius the atrebatian .
 he looked also at public opinion , wishing to have the credit of having been called and elected by the state rather than of having crept into power through the intrigues of a wife and a dotard's adoption
they consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft , or in robbery , or any other offense , is more acceptable to the immortal gods ; but when a supply of that class is wanting , they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent .
 acutia , formerly the wife of publius vitellius , had been accused of treason by laelius balbus
 there he is informed that , by the consent of all the inhabitants of antioch and roman citizens who traded there , the castle had been seized to shut him out of the town ; and that messengers had been dispatched to all those who were reported to have taken refuge in the neighboring states , that they should not come to antioch ; that if they did , that it would be attended with imminent danger to their lives . 
 on the day , however , that the senate was voting about the imperial dignities of vespasian , it had been resolved that envoys should be sent to the new emperor
 classicus then assumed the insignia of roman imperial power , and entered the camp
 thrasyllus accordingly was led up the same cliffs , and when he had deeply impressed his questioner by cleverly revealing his imperial destiny and future career , he was asked whether he had also thoroughly ascertained his own horoscope , and the character of that particular year and day
having encouraged the soldiers with no further speech than that they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted valor , and not be confused in mind , but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy ; as the latter were not further from them than the distance to which a dart could be cast , he gave the signal for commencing battle .
 some were in the act of climbing over when they were thrust down by the swords of the enemy , and fell overwhelmed by a storm of javelins and stakes
 he had also strengthened it with ditches and breastworks of stones
 in former times , too , they venerated aurinia , and many other women , but not with servile flatteries , or with sham deification
 they bestow the same care on the dead , and they hold the same belief about the lower world
he , as there was a scarcity of corn in those parts , sent out some officers of cavalry , and several military tribunes among the neighbouring states , for the purpose of procuring corn and provision ; in which number titus terrasidius was sent among the esubii ; marcus trebius gallus among the coriosolitae ; quintus velanius , titus silius , amongst the veneti .
he adopted this conduct for the following reason : because he did not think that a legate ought to engage in battle with so great a force , especially while he who held the chief command was absent , except on advantageous ground or some favorable circumstance presented itself .
 meanwhile the guards surrounded those who had sat at his table , and it was only at a late hour of the night that they were dismissed , when nero , having pictured to himself and laughed over their terror at the expectation of a fatal end to their banquet , said that they had suffered enough punishment for the consul's entertainment
 celsus and paullinus remonstrated against exposing troops wearied with a march and encumbered with baggage to any enemy , who , being himself ready for action and having marched barely four miles , would not fail to attack them , either when they were in the confusion of an advance , or when they were dispersed and busy with the work of entrenchment titianus and proculus , overcome in argument , fell back on the imperial authority
 when , however , summer was at its height some of the legions were sent back overland into winter-quarters , but most of them caesar put on board the fleet and brought down the river amisia to the ocean
 the soldiers immediately seized the arms without regard to rule or military order , no distinction being observed between praetorians and legionaries , both of whom again indiscriminately assumed the shields and helmets of the auxiliary troops
 i am well aware that it will seem a fable that any persons in the world could have been so obtuse in a city which knows everything and hides nothing , much more , that these persons should have been a consul-elect and the emperor's wife that , on an appointed day , before witnesses duly summoned , they should have come together as if for the purpose of legitimate marriage that she should have listened to the words of the bridegroom's friends , should have sacrificed to the gods , have taken her place among a company of guests , have lavished her kisses and caresses , and passed the night in the freedom which marriage permits
 he had with him 19 cohorts of infantry , 5 squadrons of cavalry , and a vast number of moors , a force trained to war by robbery and plunder
 unwarlike , unarmed , they will give way the moment they have recognised that sword and that courage of their conquerors , which have so often routed them
 caesar , as soon as he saw the cheruscan bands which in their impetuous spirit had rushed to the attack , ordered the finest of his cavalry to charge them in flank , stertinius with the other squadrons to make a detour and fall on their rear , promising himself to come up in good time
 the consuls , however , did not dare to ratify the senate's vote , and simply communicated their unanimous resolution to the emperor
 even the very sound of his rising , as popular belief adds , may be heard , and the forms of gods and the glory round his head may be seen
 subsequently no one has made the attempt , and it has been thought more pious and reverential to believe in the actions of the gods than to inquire
 hesitating for a while between shame and rage , he at last wrote to them in reply that antistius , without having been provoked by any wrong , had uttered outrageous insults against the sovereign
 if they attempted to retire down the steep , they dreaded the pursuit of our men from the rising ground , and there was but a short time till sunset : for in hopes of completing the business , they had protracted the battle almost till night . 
this institution is supposed to have been devised in britain , and to have been brought over from it into gaul ; and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying it .
there was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that of the enemy .
 the credulous mob rushed into the market-place , and demanded that piso should shew himself
 vologeses having piled up the arms and bodies of the slain in order to attest our defeat , refrained from gazing on the fugitive legions
 the defeat of the iceni quieted those who were hesitating between war and peace then the army was marched against the cangi
 even , with virtuous training , purity is not easily upheld far less amid rivalries in vice could modesty or propriety or any trace of good manners be preserved
 this was caecina's fortieth campaign as a subordinate or a commander , and , with such experience of success and peril , he was perfectly fearless
 it was this influence of fear that drew over to vitellius the province of gallia narbonensis , which turned readily to the side that was at once the nearer and the stronger
 nero , on receiving this decree of the senate and seeing that every piece of his wickedness was regarded as a conspicuous merit , drove octavia from him , alleging that she was barren , and then married poppaea
 there he was put under the secret surveillance of soldiers
 upon this decree , the consul forbade him the senate ; and when he was attempting to harangue the people , turned him out of the rostrum . 
 new reinforcements were supplied by varus alfenius with his batavians they had routed the band of gladiators , which had been ferried across the river , and which had been cut to pieces by the opposing cohorts while they were actually in the water
 he was indeed also preparing to invade by sea and land the province of africa , which lies on the same line of coast , intending by thus closing the supplies of corn to cause famine and dissension among the enemy
 why , at this very moment , he is on a tour amid the shores and lakes of campania
 night too was given up to infamy , so that virtue had not a moment left to her , but all the vilest of that promiscuous throng dared to do in the darkness anything they had lusted for in the day
 but i cannot doubt that even then there were some who secretly laughed at such a petition , though the caesars were but in the beginning of their grandeur , and ancient usage was more constantly before men's eyes , while also the tie between stepfather and stepson was weaker than that between grandfather and grandchild
the gauls having tried every expedient , as nothing had succeeded , adopted the design of fleeing from the town the next day , by the advice and order of vercingetorix .
 this enraged the people more than ever , the recent unpopularity of vinius being superadded to their old hatred against tigellinus
 some parts of their buildings they stain more carefully with a clay so clear and bright that it resembles painting , or a coloured design
 he was kept in prison , and only set at liberty after the victory of vitellius , when the resentment of the soldiery had subsided
 while claudius sat to witness the games of the circus , some of the young nobility acted on horseback the battle of troy among them was britannicus , the emperor's son , and lucius domitius , who became soon afterwards by adoption heir to the empire with the surname of nero the stronger popular enthusiasm which greeted him was taken to presage his greatness
 this was vonones , who had been given as an hostage to augustus by phraates
 all this was known to caesar
 they were under the command of pompeius silvanus , a man of consular rank
 no tribune or centurion encouraged them , every man acted on his own impulse and guidance , and the vilest found their chief incitement in the dejection of the good
 they are particularly delighted by gifts from neighbouring tribes , which are sent not only by individuals but also by the state , such as choice steeds , heavy armour , trappings , and neck-chains
 at rome the senate , delighted and full of confident hope , decreed to vespasian all the honours customarily bestowed on the emperors and indeed the civil war , which , beginning in gaul and spain , and afterwards drawing into the struggle first germany and then illyricum , had traversed aegypt , judaea , and syria , every province , and every army , this war , now that the whole earth was , as it were , purged from guilt , seemed to have reached its close
 this becoming known to the enemy , they suddenly changed their plan , and with their whole force attacked by night the ninth legion , as being the weakest , and cutting down the sentries , who were asleep or panic-stricken , they broke into the camp
 the soldier brings his wounds to mother and wife , who shrink not from counting or even demanding them and who administer both food and encouragement to the combatants
 instead of reckoning by days as we do , they reckon by nights , and in this manner fix both their ordinary and their legal appointments
 which is the most pitiable , to be accused for friendship's sake or to have to accuse a friend , i cannot decide
 the iceni , a powerful tribe , which war had not weakened , as they had voluntarily joined our alliance , were the first to resist
 but marcus bibulus was appointed commander-in-chief of the whole maritime department , and regulated every matter . 
 in the fifth year of the war agricola , himself in the leading ship , crossed the clota , and subdued in a series of victories tribes hitherto unknown
 have you not heard that the cohorts at brundusium are composed of invalids ? the forces which you now behold , have been recruited by levies lately made in hither spain , and the greater part from the colonies beyond the po ; moreover , the flower of the forces perished in the two engagements at dyrrachium . 
 it opened thus 
these were reviewed in the country of the aedui , and a calculation was made of their numbers : commanders were appointed : the supreme command is intrusted to commius the atrebatian , viridomarus and eporedirix the aeduans , and vergasillaunus the arvernan , the cousin-german of vercingetorix .
 then to the tubantes
 ptolemy , however , with the true disposition of a despot , though prone to alarm , was , when the feeling of security returned , more intent on pleasures than on religious matters and he began by degrees to neglect the affair , and to turn his thoughts to other concerns , till at length the same apparition , but now more terrible and peremptory , denounced ruin against the king and his realm , unless his bidding were performed
 give therefore your love and respect to the cause of peace , and to that capital in which we , conquerors and conquered , claim an equal right
 he collects , likewise , from the neighboring countries , as many cohorts as he can from pompey's new levies . 
having provided corn and selected his cavalry , he began to direct his march toward those parts in which he heard the germans were .
 on the other , were the letters of mucianus and everyone else inveighed against him , as an ill-affected and conceited man , nor did they forget the scandals of his early life
 these were the legions which a short time before had belonged to the enemy ; for the custom of offering free towns to those who joined the opposite party had changed caesar's kindness . 
 these orders the boldest spirit among the ambassadors thus expounded for your return into the unity of the german nation and name we give thanks to the gods whom we worship in common and to mars , the chief of our divinities , and we congratulate you that at length you will live as free men among the free
 the rest voted with agrippa priscus was dragged off to prison and instantly put to death
 the people of temnus , philadelpheia , aegae , apollonis , the mostenians , and hyrcanian macedonians , as they were called , with the towns of hierocaesarea , myrina , cyme , and tmolus , were it was decided , to be exempted from tribute for the same time , and some one was to be sent from the senate to examine their actual condition and to relieve them
 when he had nodded assent , they began to plead their cause
 it is not for us to criticise one whom you may raise above all others , or your motives for so doing
 they went to rome , and while they waited for nero , who was intent on other engagements , among the sights shown to the barbarians they were admitted into pompey's theatre , where they might behold the vastness of the roman people
 varro after a while , as he was infirm and aged , yielded to silius who was in his prime
 they had provided iron hooks and harpoons , and had furnished themselves with a vast number of javelins , darts , and missiles . 
 they had provided neither money nor corn , and they were embarrassed by the general impatience and rapacity
 from an angry conversation they passed by degrees to long and bitter speeches helvidius asked , why should marcellus be so afraid of the judgment of the magistrates
 without further delay galba sided with these more plausible advisers
 and looking round saw anicetus , who had with him the captain of the trireme , herculeius , and obaritus , a centurion of marines
 letters also from drusus were read , which , though studiously modest in expression , were taken to be extremely supercilious
 nor did he accept a legacy from any one unless he had earned it by friendship
 two squadrons were sent with the deserter , and outflanked the unsuspecting enemy
 if an assembly were called , there too the lead of a few was followed by the shout of the many
 nero , on the contrary , with his slave girl mistress , tied down by his attachment to acte , had derived nothing from his slavish associations but what was low and degrading
 as to the tribes of the peucini , veneti , and fenni , i am in doubt whether i should class them with the germans or the sarmatæ , although indeed the peucini called by some bastarnæ , are like germans in their language , mode of life , and in the permanence of their settlements
 the age and moderation of the new emperor reassure us
 for bibulus at corcyra , being informed of caesar's approach , hoped to fall in with some part of our ships , with their cargoes , but found them empty ; and having taken about thirty , vented on them his rage at his own remissness , and set them all on fire : and , with the same flames , he destroyed the mariners and masters of the vessels , hoping by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest . 
 vitellius detained suetonius paullinus and licinus proculus in all the wretchedness of an odious imprisonment when they were heard , they resorted to a defence , necessary rather than honourable
 caesar , however , while the vessels were coming up , ordered silius , his lieutenant-general , to make an inroad on the chatti with a flying column
 he swept through italy as if it were a conquered country and caressed the legions as if they were his own
they , advancing to the river with their cavalry and chariots from the higher ground , began to annoy our men and give battle .
 nec recusaturum tiridaten accipiendo diademati in urbem venire , nisi sacerdotii religione attineretur 
 yet the prosecution was continued in the senate with the same persistency , and tiberius declared on oath that he would have interceded for his life , guilty though he was , but for his hasty suicide
 caesar , encouraged by their zeal and importunity , though he felt reluctant to expose his army to a river so exceedingly large , yet judged it prudent to attempt it and make a trial . 
 neither rank nor age nor previous high promotion hindered any one from practising the art of a greek or latin actor and even stooping to gestures and songs unfit for a man
 nor did this end their miseries
 corbulo , however , notwithstanding his successes thought he must use his good fortune with moderation , and sent vologeses a message of remonstrance against the violence done to a roman province , and the blockade of an allied and friendly king and of roman cohorts
caesar , discovering their design , leads his army into the territories of cassivellaunus to the river thames ; which river can be forded in one place only and that with difficulty .
 nor ought we to fall back on imperial authority , when we can have recourse to the laws
 in the mean time , being informed that thermus the praetor was in possession of iguvium , with five cohorts , and was fortifying the town , but that the affections of all the inhabitants were very well inclined toward himself , he detached curio with three cohorts , which he had at ariminum and pisaurus . 
 but for the reasons already known , he was dissuaded from wishing to engage , and the more especially , because the short space between the camps , even if the enemy were put to flight , would not contribute much to a decisive victory ; for the two camps were not distant from each other above two thousand feet . 
thither only two british states sent hostages ; the rest omitted to do so .
 cestius undertook the prosecution and this was the most dreadful feature of the age , that leading members of the senate , some openly , some secretly employed themselves in the very lowest work of the informer
 night they regard as bringing on day
 this alarm opened the ears that had before been deaf to their general's advice
 next to primus in influence was cornelius fuscus , the procurator
 under happier auspices and in a more loyal spirit the flavianist leaders were discussing the plans of the campaign
 it was then agreed that tiridates should lay down his royal crown before caesar's image , and resume it only from the hand of nero
he makes inquiries on the same points privately of others , and discovered that it is all true ; that dumnorix is the person , a man of the highest daring , in great favor with the people on account of his liberality , a man eager for a revolution : that for a great many years he has been in the habit of contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the aedui at a small cost , because when he bids , no one dares to bid against him .
 piso , although the emperor had said that he would be absent , held that all the more ought the business to be transacted , that the state might have honour of its senate and knights being able to perform their duties in the sovereign's absence
 and even the invective against vitellius comes too late , and is ungenerous
 do you suppose that the romans will be as brave in war as they are licentious in peace
 lucius himself sent to his brother a laurelled dispatch with an account of his success , and asked whether he wished him at once to return to rome , or to complete the subjugation of campania
caesar , accepting their defense , demands hostages , and orders them to be brought to him on a specified day , and assures them that unless they did so he would visit their state with war .
 men changed from one side to the other under the pressure of fear or necessity
 nor did he perish , they said , by his own hand , but by that of one sent to be his executioner
 apamea , too , which had been shaken by an earthquake , had its tribute remitted for five years
 they raised their hands to the gods , to the statue of augustus , and to the knees of tiberius , when he ordered a document to be produced and read
accordingly , they refer the matter to a council , and a great controversy arises among them .
 civilis confronted him with his troops ranged , not in line , but in columns
but what other motive or wish have the romans , than , induced by envy , to settle in the lands and states of those whom they have learned by fame to be noble and powerful in war , and impose on them perpetual slavery ? for they never have carried on wars on any other terms .
 then the sun was suddenly darkened and the fourteen districts of the city were struck by lightning
 this tiberius did not approve , either interpreting unfavourably every act of germanicus , or because he thought that the spectacle of the slain and unburied made the army slow to fight and more afraid of the enemy , and that a general invested with the augurate and its very ancient ceremonies ought not to have polluted himself with funeral rites
 having deliberated on the matter , they replied , and sent written proposals to him by the same persons , the purport of which was , that caesar should return into gaul , leave ariminum , and disband his army : if he complied with this , that pompey would go to spain . 
 julius montanus , a senator , but one who had not yet held any office , happened to encounter the prince in the darkness , and because he fiercely repulsed his attack and then on recognizing him begged for mercy , as though this was a reproach , forced to destroy himself
 after this he dismissed every one , and took some repose
 it was really not sejanus of vulsinii , it was a member of the claudian and julian houses , in which he had taken a position by his marriage-alliance , it was your son-in-law , caesar , your partner in the consulship , the man who administered your political functions , whom we courted
 one after another was ruined by the same poverty and license , and rushed into mutiny and dissension , and finally into civil war otho , however , not to alienate the affections of the centurions by an act of bounty to the ranks , promised that his own purse should pay these annual sums
 a temple , proportioned to the grandeur of the city , was erected in a place called rhacotis , where there had stood a chapel consecrated in old times to serapis and isis
 by command of vitellius all the batavian youth was then being summoned to the conscription , a thing naturally vexatious , and which the officials made yet more burdensome by their rapacity and profligacy , while they selected aged and infirm persons , whom they might discharge for a consideration , and mere striplings , but of distinguished beauty and many attained even in boyhood to a noble stature , whom they dragged off for infamous purposes
 accordingly , an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty then , upon their information , an immense multitude was convicted , not so much of the crime of firing the city , as of hatred against mankind
 but though military men had put him on his guard against imminent disasters , still , not wishing to seem to need the advice of others , he would fall back on some quite different and inferior plan
 the general's speech was followed by enthusiasm in the soldiers , and the signal for battle was given
 pompey , also , guessing at caesar's design , determined to hasten to scipio , that if caesar should march in that direction , he might be ready to relieve him ; but that if caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and corcyra , because he expected legions and cavalry from italy , he himself might fall on domitius with all his forces . 
 the men then charged as confidently as if they had been strengthened by fresh reinforcements , while the enemy's array was now less compact for , as there was no one to command , it was now contracted , now extended , as the courage or fear of individual soldiers might prompt
 who will be kept safe by the number of his slaves when four hundred have not protected pedanius secundus
 with domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen , to know that our sighs were being recorded , to have , ever ready to note the pallid looks of so many faces , that savage countenance reddened with the hue with which he defied shame
 our troops attacked them on the way , dispersed and unprepared moreover the treveri had constructed a breastwork and rampart across their territory , and they and the germans continued to contend with great losses on both sides up to the time when they tarnished by rebellion their distinguished services to the roman people
 but any detailed account of them would be misleading , since they moved from place to place as circumstances required , and had their numbers increased and sometimes diminished
 that every one about the person of britannicus should care nothing for right or honour , had long ago been provided for
 still , though this is instructive , it gives very little pleasure
these things being finished , and the assizes being concluded , he returns into hither gaul , and proceeds thence to the army .
 it was next proposed to relax the papia poppaea law , which augustus in his old age had passed subsequently to the julian statutes , for yet further enforcing the penalties on celibacy and for enriching the exchequer
 what meant the sad sight
 the most needy of the populace and the most worthless of the slaves did not fail to come forward and betray their wealthy masters
 and as our men , who had completed their works by drawing lines of communication from one fort to another , were afraid that pompey's men would sally out from some part , and attack us in the rear ; so the enemy were making a continued fortification in a circuit within ours to prevent us from breaking in on any side , or surrounding them on the rear . 
 mnester alone occasioned a pause rending off his clothes , he insisted on claudius looking at the scars of his stripes and remembering his words when he surrendered himself , without reserve , to messalina's bidding
 the wise looked to the interests of peace and of the commonwealth , while the giddy and those who were thoughtless of the future were inflated with idle hopes
 on the disclosure of his information , anteius and ostorius were classed with condemned criminals rather than with men on their trial , so completely , indeed , that no one would attest the will of anteius , till tigellinus interposed to sanction it
 gaul did not hesitate to follow
 so the senate drew up a decree in the severe spirit of antiquity , and the consuls issued a not less stringent proclamation
 caesar having sent forward his cavalry , to annoy and retard their rear , followed close after with his legions . 
they reckoned that a term of two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs ; they fix by decree their departure for the third year .
 there was no appearance of the triumphant general about germanicus , and he seemed to be in a conquered city rather than in his own camp , while groans and wailings attracted the ears and looks even of the soldiers
 then came the news about caecina , and he heard with a satisfaction mingled with distress , first , that he had revolted , and then , that he had been put in irons by the army
 intelligence was brought to afranius that the great convoys , which were on their march to caesar , had halted at the river . 
 soon afterwards this same piso gave an equal proof of a fearless sense of wrong by suing urgulania , whom augusta's friendship had raised above the law
this circumstance is reported to the enemy by some deserters from lucius aemilius , a captain of the gallic horse .
 caesar sent publius vatinius , one of his lieutenants , to the bank of the river , to make such proposals as should appear most conducive to peace ; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice asking , are citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat of peace ? a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the pyrenean mountains , and to robbers , especially when by so doing they would prevent citizens from fighting against citizens . 
 for we now expect from a speaker even poetic beauty , not indeed soiled with the old rust of accius or pacuvius , but such as is produced from the sacred treasures of horace , virgil , and lucan
 then the enemy fell upon the sutlers and roman traders , who were wandering about in every direction , as they would in a time of peace
 their voyage was prosperous , and the response of the oracle was clear
 t vinius thought that he should remain within the palace , array the slaves against the foe , secure the approaches , and not go out to the enraged soldiers
 think not of how it fared with the armies of vindex
 but , lost among the crowd of greater criminals , in the vast confusion of events , they were neither rewarded by otho nor punished by vitellius
 when these came near our ships , our veteran soldiers retreated within the harbor . 
 libo having sailed from oricum , with a fleet of fifty ships , which he commanded , came to brundusium , and seized an island , which lies opposite to the harbor ; judging it better to guard that place , which was our only pass to sea , than to keep all the shores and ports blocked up by a fleet . 
having attempted to take it by storm on his march , because he heard that it was destitute of defenders , he was not able to carry it by assault , on account of the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall , though few were defending it .
 this is a lake of vast circumference
 and as she was forbidden to approach nero , she would haunt his doors and implore him to hear an innocent man , and not surrender to a freedman one who had once been his colleague in the consulship , now pleading with the cries of a woman , now again forgetting her sex and lifting up her voice in a tone of menace , till the emperor showed himself unmoved alike by entreaty and reproach
 take away the rewards of a profession , and the profession must perish
 the irritation of the legions still increased , nor had the imprisonment of a single soldier struck them with terror
 imagining that he mitigated the scandal by disgracing many others , he brought on the stage descendants of noble families , who sold themselves because they were paupers
 with minds affected by these words and growing mutually suspicious , they divided off the new troops from the old , and one legion from another
caesar arrived here in two days ; after pitching his camp before the town , being prevented by the time of the day , he defers the attack to the next day , and orders his soldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that enterprise ; and as a bridge over the loire connected the town of genabum with the opposite bank , fearing lest the inhabitants should escape by night from the town , he orders two legions to keep watch under arms .
 the nearer the emperor approached to rome , the greater was the license of his march , accompanied as it was by players and herds of eunuchs , in fact by all that had characterised the court of nero
they all concurred in asserting , what caesar himself had already ascertained by his scouts , that the back of that hill was almost level ; but likewise woody and narrow , by which there was a pass to the other side of the town ; that they had serious apprehensions for this place , and had no other idea , on the occupation of one hill by the romans , than that , if they should lose the other , they would be almost surrounded , and cut off from all egress and foraging ; that they were all summoned by vercingetorix to fortify this place .
 gallus proposed that the elections of magistrates should be held every five years , and that the commanders of the legions who before receiving a praetorship discharged this military service should at once become praetorselect , the emperor nominating twelve candidates every year
 atilla , the mother of annaeus lucanus , without either acquittal or punishment , was simply ignored
 they saw themselves hemmed in , without arms , filthy and squalid and when they began to be separated , some to be marched to one spot , and some to another , a thrill of terror ran through them all
when they saw that they persisted in their resolution , they began to shout aloud , and give intelligence of their flight to the romans .
 in his peril he found safety only in the camp of the first legion
 against the boldest of these , who after the manner of their country were disporting themselves with songs and dances in front of the rampart , he sent some picked archers , who , discharging distant volleys , inflicted many wounds without loss to themselves
 the more relatives he has , the more numerous his connections , the more honoured is his old age
 they will surely fly , as did the now deified julius , if once we emulate the valour of our sires
 at the next meeting of the senate caesar began by recommending that the wrongs , the resentments , and the terrible necessities of former times , should be forgotten , and mucianus spoke at great length in favour of the informers
a part of the hostages being now delivered up , when the rest of the terms were being performed , a few centurions and soldiers being sent into the town to collect the arms and horses , the enemy's cavalry which had outstripped the main body of vercingetorix's army , was seen at a distance ; as soon as the townsmen beheld them , and entertained hopes of assistance , raising a shout , they began to take up arms , shut the gates , and line the walls .
 vitellius himself , mounted on a splendid charger , with military cloak and sword , advanced from the mulvian bridge , driving the senate and people before him but deterred by the advice of his friends from marching into rome as if it were a captured city , he assumed a civil garb , and proceeded with his army in orderly array
 a successor he should accept as an announcement of his doom
 they said that it was by his orders that they had offered battle to the batavians , supposing that the legions from mogontiacum were following them
 pay and provisions were scanty , gaul was rebelling against conscription and taxes , while the rhine , owing to a drought unexampled in that climate , would hardly admit of navigation , and thus supplies were straitened at the same time that outposts had to be established along the entire bank to keep the germans from fording the stream the self-same cause thus bringing about a smaller supply of grain and a greater number of consumers
 he bore no longer the suspense of fear or of hope
 she hastened herself to effect poppaea's destruction , and hired agents to drive her to suicide by the terrors of a prison caesar meanwhile was so unconscious that a few days afterwards he asked her husband scipio , who was dining with him , why he sat down to table without his wife , and was told in reply that she had paid the debt of nature
 he accordingly devoted a few days to the repair of his fleet , and , at the same time , in remembrance of his ancestors , he visited the bay which the victory of actium had made famous , the spoils consecrated by augustus , and the camp of antonius
 one septimius , who fled to the tribunal and was grovelling at caecina's feet , was persistently demanded till he was given up to destruction
 the emperor promised ten million sesterces , and remitted for five years all they paid to the exchequer or to the emperor's purse
 but servilius and cornelius , his accusers , alleged adultery with livia and the practice of magical rites
 but he was easy of approach his courtesy was open to all , and he had thus virtues with which the parthians were unfamiliar , and vices new to them
 the victorious enemy met petilius cerialis , commander of the ninth legion , as he was coming to the rescue , routed his troops , and destroyed all his infantry
 i often inquire into them by myself that which consoles some minds , to me increases the difficulty for i perceive that even with the greeks it has happened that there is a greater distance between aeschines and demosthenes on the one hand , and your friend nicetes or any other orator who shakes ephesus or mitylene with a chorus of rhetoricians and their noisy applause , on the other , than that which separates afer , africanus , or yourselves from cicero or asinius
 when galba heard of the mutiny in germany , though nothing was as yet known about vitellius , he felt anxious as to the direction which the violence of the legions might take , while he could not trust even the soldiery of the capital he therefore resorted to what he supposed to be the only remedy , and held a council for the election of an emperor
 after making these arrangements , he ordered his soldiers to go on board without noise , and disposed here and there , on the wall and turrets , some light-armed veterans , archers and slingers . 
 the people were summoned as to a grand spectacle
 domitian had entered into possession of the title and residence of caesar , but not yet applying himself to business , was playing the part of a son of the throne with debauchery and intrigue
a proper garrison is selected for the town .
 as for her , careless of concealment , she went continually with a numerous retinue to his house , she haunted his steps , showered on him wealth and honours , and , at last , as though empire had passed to another , the slaves , the freedmen , the very furniture of the emperor were to be seen in the possession of the paramour
 se priora et totiens iactata super obtineneda armenia nunc omittere , quoniam dii , quamvis potentium populorum arbitri , possessionem parthis non sine ignominia romana tradidissent
when he had arrived there , the enemy's scouts , as they were stationed along every part of the river , not expecting an attack , because a great storm had suddenly arisen , were surprised by our soldiers : the infantry and cavalry are quickly transported , under the superintendence of the roman knights , whom he had appointed to that office .
 thus the sentiments of all having been discovered and laid bare , the discussion is renewed on the following day , and from each occasion its own peculiar advantage is derived
 there , as he was wisely enduring a most undeserved calamity , he was suddenly seized by a centurion sent to slay him
 to keep his soldiers free from sloth , he dug a canal of twenty-three miles in length between the rhine and the meuse , as a means of avoiding the uncertain perils of the ocean
 the loss of chastity meets with no indulgence
 popular talk was confirmed by an interpretation put with similar credulity on a flash of lightning
 thus , though engaged with superior numbers , he sustained the furious charge of the legions and the horse . 
 of these grave accusations he brought no proof whatever , and then repenting , sought , when the crime had been consummated , a pardon which could be of no avail
 far from it you have , i think , only made a beginning , and indicated , so to say , its traces and outlines
 every one may believe or disbelieve them as he feels inclined
 for she had gained such a hold on the aged augustus that he drove out as an exile into the island of planasia , his only grandson , agrippa postumus , who , though devoid of worthy qualities , and having only the brute courage of physical strength , had not been convicted of any gross offence
 that the consuls , praetors , tribunes of the people , and proconsuls in the city , should take care that the state received no injury . 
 but his sons might alike visit both , and not compromise the imperial dignity , which inspired the greatest awe at a distance
 when agrippa died , and lucius caesar as he was on his way to our armies in spain , and caius while returning from armenia , still suffering from a wound , were prematurely cut off by destiny , or by their step-mother livia's treachery , drusus too having long been dead , nero remained alone of the stepsons , and in him everything tended to centre
 in both quarters plunder was collected with peculiar hostility in the case of the ubii , because , this nation , being of german origin , had forsworn its native country , and assumed the roman name of the agrippinenses
 even the ocean had worn the aspect of blood , and , when the tide ebbed , there had been left the likenesses of human forms , marvels interpreted by the britons , as hopeful , by the veterans , as alarming
 the troops under the control of silius , with minds yet in suspense , watched the issue of mutiny elsewhere but the soldiers of the lower army fell into a frenzy , which had its beginning in the men of the twenty-first and fifth legions , and into which the first and twentieth were also drawn
for during the whole of this battle , although the fight lasted from the seventh hour to eventide , no one could see an enemy with his back turned .
 while the whole space outside the town , up to its buildings , was bright with sunlight , the enclosure within the walls was suddenly shrouded in a black cloud , seamed with lightning-flashes , and thus the city was thought to be given up to destruction , as if heaven was wroth against it
 they said further that he had nobles about him for his letters , books , and accounts , titles all and rehearsals of supreme power
 germany and its mighty legions are far from us , and we know that even countries protected by infantry and cavalry have been plundered and ravaged by the fleet
 then the bravest centurions among the othonianists were put to death this , more than anything else , alienated from vitellius the armies of illyricum
 meantime , agrippina's peril being universally known and taken to be an accidental occurrence , everybody , the moment he heard of it , hurried down to the beach
 but while we instinctively shrink from a writer's adulation , we lend a ready ear to detraction and spite , because flattery involves the shameful imputation of servility , whereas malignity wears the false appearance of honesty
 place was then given to the witnesses , and the appearance among them of publius egnatius provoked as much indignation as the cruelty of the prosecution had excited pity
 accordingly he intercepted a letter from anteius , and having also stolen some notes about the day of his nativity and his future career , which were hidden away among pammenes' secret papers , and having further discovered some remarks on the birth and life of ostorius scapula , he wrote to the emperor that he would communicate important news which would contribute to his safety , if he could but obtain a brief reprieve of his exile
 mark you , how in one breath they cry for my punishment and for your execution
 there is , he said , no alliance , as once there was
 cossutianus made a beginning , and then marcellus in more violent tones exclaimed that the whole commonwealth was at stake
 the leading men in the state had secret conferences with flavius sabinus , prefect of the city , urging him to secure a share in the credit of the victory
 in the consulship of didius junius and quintus haterius , nero , now sixteen years of age , married octavia , the emperor's daughter
 really i think that the characteristic and peculiar vices of this city , a liking for actors and a passion for gladiators and horses , are all but conceived in the mother's womb
 it was ascertained that rome had provisions for no more than fifteen days , and it was through the signal bounty of heaven and the mildness of the winter that its desperate plight was relieved
 is it a small thing that veneti and insubres have already burst into the senate-house , unless a mob of foreigners , a troop of captives , so to say , is now forced upon us
 having examined this place , curio got a view of varus's camp , joining the wall and town , at the gate called bellica , well fortified by its natural situation , on one side by the town itself , on the other by a theater which is before the town , the approaches to the town being rendered difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of that structure . 
then they shouted , according to their custom , that some of our men should go forward to a conference , that they had some things which they desired to say respecting the common interest , by which they trusted their disputes could be removed .
 of this the cause and origin was aelius sejanus , commander of the praetorian cohorts , of whose influence i have already spoken
 at rome the wills of the childless were , so to say , caught in his snare while italy and the provinces were drained by a boundless usury
 tiberius too , though he had offspring of his own , had adopted germanicus
 tutor , having augmented the army of the treveri with fresh levies from the vangiones , the caeracates , and the triboci , strengthened it with a force of veteran infantry and cavalry , men from the legions whom he had either corrupted by promises or overborne by intimidation
 then indeed , not having opportunity either to choose a convenient position for their camp , or to march forward , they were obliged to halt , and to encamp at a distance from water , and on ground naturally unfavorable . 
 here was the first step to breaking open private houses here , if resistance were made , a pretext for slaughter
 although , he said , i am not ignorant of the reports about silanus , still we must decide nothing by hearsay
 there , at the suggestion of the commanding officer , he was hailed with joyful shouts , and set on a litter
 yours too is a still vigorous manhood , quite equal to the labours of business and to the fruit of those labours and , as for myself , i am but treading the threshold of empire but perhaps you count yourself inferior to vitellius , thrice a consul , and me to claudius such wealth as long thrift has procured for volusius , my bounty , you think , cannot fully make up to you
 meetings , conversations , the ear of friend and stranger were alike shunned
 but i can more easily believe that tiberius and augusta , who did not leave the palace , kept her within , that their sorrow might seem equal to hers , and that the grandmother and uncle might be thought to follow the mother's example in staying at home
 without hesitation vitellius surrendered himself and his cohorts to the discretion of the conqueror , and the soldiers threw down their ill-starred arms in rage quite as much as in alarm
 they simply observe the custom of burning the bodies of illustrious men with certain kinds of wood
 thrasea checked his impetuous temper , not wishing him to attempt what would be as futile , and useless to the accused , as it would be fatal to the protester
 messengers now came in haste and alarm to inform fabius valens , how otho's fleet was threatening the province of gallia narbonensis , which had sworn allegiance to vitellius
 a salutary delay will bring us new forces , while we shall lose nothing of what we have
 he offered to those who stayed service on honourable terms , to those who departed the spoils of the roman army
 but , making each pleasant spot ring with the noise of their daily and nightly dissipation , they dispersed their soldiers on errands which were to minister to their luxury , and never spoke of war , except at their banquets
 what a march is this before us ! they cried , who will lead us on our way
 i am aware , senators , that many deplore my want of firmness in not having opposed a similar recent petition from the cities of asia
 the caralitani , as soon as they heard that valerius was sent against them , even before he left italy , of their own accord drove cotta out of the town ; who , terrified because he understood that the whole province was combined against him , fled from sardinia to africa . 
 for they not only entered our lines before the roman army began to retire , but also stood about the camp streets , recognizing and dragging off slaves or beasts of burden which we had previously captured
 about this time caius caesar , who became his grandfather's companion on his retirement to capreae , married claudia , daughter of marcus silanus he was a man who masked a savage temper under an artful guise of self-restraint , and neither his mother's doom nor the banishment of his brothers extorted from him a single utterance
 yet all have their weapons in readiness , and an army if necessary , with a multitude of men and horses
these matters being settled , caesar went to port itius with the legions .
 had he had the sole control of affairs , had he possessed the power and title of a king , he would have attained military glory as much more easily as he had excelled alexander in clemency , in self-restraint , and in all other virtues
 thus two soldiers from the ranks undertook to transfer the empire of rome , and actually transferred it
the sites of their towns were generally such that , being placed on extreme points and on promontories , they neither had an approach by land when the tide had rushed in from the main ocean , which always happens twice in the space of twelve hours ; nor by ships , because , upon the tide ebbing again , the ships were likely to be dashed upon the shoals .
 dictatorships were held for a temporary crisis
 the latter menaced italy
they entice from the town of cabillonus , by a promise of safety , marcus aristius , a military tribune , who was on his march to his legion ; they compel those who had settled there for the purpose of trading to do the same .
caesar , when he observes this , draws off his forces to the next hill , and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy .
when vercingetorix , nevertheless , would not descend to the level ground , a slight cavalry action , and that a successful one , having taken place , he led back his army into the camp .
 there were many sanguinary encounters between the soldiers for ever since the mutiny which broke out at ticinum there had lingered a spirit of dissension between the legions and the auxiliary troops , though they could unite whenever they had to fight with the rustic population
 either he invented this in his terror , or he thus confessed his share in the conspiracy his life and character incline us rather to believe that he was an accomplice in the crime which he certainly caused
 while antonius was deliberating as to what was to be done , arrius varus , eager to do his best , charged with the bravest of the cavalry , and drove back the vitellianists , inflicting upon them some slight loss
 if we are conquered , we must die
 for tiberius would inaugurate everything with the consuls , as though the ancient constitution remained , and he hesitated about being emperor
 lighter offences , too , have penalties proportioned to them he who is convicted , is fined in a certain number of horses or of cattle
 lastly , he had , they said , destroyed germanicus himself by sorceries and poison , and hence came those ceremonies and horrible sacrifices made by himself and plancina then he had threatened the state with war , and had been defeated in battle , before he could be tried as a prisoner
 blaesus , with the consummate tact of an orator , said , it is not through mutiny and tumult that the desires of the army ought to be communicated to caesar , nor did our soldiers of old ever ask so novel a boon of ancient commanders , nor have you yourselves asked it of the divine augustus
 he then entrusted the conduct of his meditated treason to onomastus , one of his freedmen , who brought over to his views barbius proculus , officer of the watchword to the bodyguard , and veturius , a deputy centurion in the same force having assured himself by various conversations with these men that they were cunning and bold , he loaded them with presents and promises , and furnished them with money with which to tempt the cupidity of others
 i may mention that the colonies of nuceria and capua were strengthened by an addition of veterans to every member of the city populace four hundred sesterces were given , and forty million paid into the exchequer to maintain the credit of the citizens
 as soon as the fleet was seen on the horizon , not only the harbour and the adjacent shores , but the city walls too and the roofs and every place which commanded the most distant prospect were filled with crowds of mourners , who incessantly asked one another , whether , when she landed , they were to receive her in silence or with some utterance of emotion
 the inhabitants however opened the gates of their own accord , and surrendered themselves and their property to the romans
 this compliment was paid to their ancient alliance , and to the fact that they alone of the gauls cling to the name of brothers of the roman people
 so sejanus inveighed against agrippina's arrogance , and worked powerfully on augusta's old hatred of her and on livia's consciousness of recent guilt , and urged both these women to represent to the emperor that her pride as a mother and her reliance on popular enthusiasm were leading her to dream of empire
 at nightfall , leaving his tent of augury by a secret exit , unknown to the sentries , with one companion , his shoulders covered with a wild beast's skin , he visited the camp streets , stood by the tents , and enjoyed the men's talk about himself , as one extolled his noble rank , another , his handsome person , nearly all of them , his endurance , his gracious manner and the evenness of his temper , whether he was jesting or was serious , while they acknowledged that they ought to repay him with their gratitude in battle , and at the same time sacrifice to a glorious vengeance the perfidious violators of peace
 long before the arrival of titus , both armies had taken the oath of allegiance to otho the news had come , as is usual , with great speed , while there was much to delay the gigantic undertaking of a civil war , for which the east after a long period of repose was then for the first time preparing
 in the consulship of sisenna statilius taurus and lucius libo there was a commotion in the kingdoms and roman provinces of the east it had its origin among the parthians , who disdained as a foreigner a king whom they had sought and received from rome , though he was of the family of the arsacids
 then the defendant sought the advocacy of lucius arruntius , marcus vinicius , asinius gallus , aeserninus marcellus and sextus pompeius , and on their declining for different reasons , marcus lepidus , lucius piso , and livineius regulus became his counsel , amid the excitement of the whole country , which wondered how much fidelity would be shown by the friends of germanicus , on what the accused rested his hopes , and how far tiberius would repress and hide his feelings
 africa and its legions , now that clodius macer was dead , were disposed to be content with any emperor , after having experienced the rule of a smaller tyrant
 nero meanwhile declared by edict that the prefect had been corrupted into a design of gaining over the fleet , and added , in forgetfulness of his late charge of barrenness against octavia , that , conscious of her profligacies , she had procured abortion , a fact he had himself ascertained
 caesar , observing his former custom , had placed the tenth legion on the right , the ninth on the left , although it was very much weakened by the battles at dyrrachium . 
 the supreme direction rested with germanicus , then busily employed in conducting the assessment of gaul
when they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking , they set fire to all their towns , in number about twelve-to their villages about four hundred-and to the private dwellings that remained ; they burn up all the corn , except what they intend to carry with them ; that after destroying the hope of a return home , they might be the more ready for undergoing all dangers .
 the men opposed his departure with their weapons , threatening him repeatedly if he would not go back
 this was publius suilius he had been terrible and venal , while claudius reigned , and when times were changed , he was not so much humbled as his enemies wished , and was one who would rather seem a criminal than a suppliant
 they deliberate when they have no power to dissemble
 even in their fury , this seemed to them a savage act and one of evil precedent , and there was a pause during which caesar's friends hurried him into his tent
 henceforth tiberius even in private conversations persisted in showing contempt for such homage to himself
 that this might be the more promptly effected , a colony of a strong body of veterans was established at camulodunum on the conquered lands , as a defence against the rebels , and as a means of imbuing the allies with respect for our laws
 the people of ceea , who were inferior in numbers , had summoned to their aid the garamantes , a wild race incessantly occupied in robbing their neighbours
 for my part i hold all eloquence in its every variety something sacred and venerable , and i regard as preferable to all studies of other arts not merely your tragedian's buskin or the measures of heroic verse , but even the sweetness of the lyric ode , the playfulness of the elegy , the satire of the iambic , the wit of the epigram , and indeed any other form of eloquence
 julius tutor and julius sabinus joined him in his schemes one was a trever , the other a lingon
 i was put off by that dilatory general , and , as i found but little protection in the laws , i urged him to arrest myself , arminius , and his accomplices
 northwards the country takes a vast sweep
 however , in a little time , by messengers sent from one side to the other , they were informed of domitius's meditated flight , of which they were previously ignorant . 
 then , after losing a centurion and a few soldiers whom he had sent on in advance to reconnoitre the enemy's forces , he returned in alarm
 this we had foreseen
 he then upbraided them with their fatal infatuation , revived not so much by the anger of the soldiers as by that of heaven , and explained the reasons of the envoys' arrival
 to raise the dignity of the priesthood and to inspire the priests with more zeal in attending to the ceremonial , a gift of two million sesterces was decreed to the vestal cornelia , chosen in the room of scantia and , whenever augusta entered the theatre , she was to have a place in the seats of the vestals
 when galba had fallen , he was strongly disposed in favour of otho he even looked beyond africa and threatened spain , which is separated from it only by a narrow strait
after he perceived that this was too difficult to accomplish , he issued in silence from his camp at the third watch , and reached melodunum by the same route by which he came .
 with a most rare felicity , his good nature did not weaken his authority , nor his strictness the attachment of his friends
 classicus despatched one aemilius longinus , a deserter from the first legion , and speedily accomplished the murder
 for the huge shields and unwieldly lances of the barbarians cannot , amid trunks of trees and brushwood that springs from the ground , be so well managed as our javelins and swords and closefitting armour
 let us not be panicstricken at the result of one or two engagements
then , again , following the change of tide , he urged on with the oars that he might make that part of the island in which he had discovered the preceding summer , that there was the best landing-place , and in this affair the spirit of our soldiers was very much to be extolled ; for they with the transports and heavy ships , the labor of rowing not being discontinued , equaled the speed of the ships of war .
 vologeses , however , sent a message to corbulo , requiring him to remove the fortresses on the further bank of the euphrates , and to leave the river to be , as formerly , the boundary between them
 this having been heard and become generally known , the allies were discontented and the legions murmured
 two of our ships , that had not kept up with the rest , being overtaken by the night , and not knowing what port the rest had made to , came to an anchor opposite lissus . 
 what day , they asked , will be without some execution , when amid sacrifices and prayers , a time when it is usual to refrain even from a profane word , the chain and halter are introduced
they say that special care should be paid to this , that caesar should be cut off from his army before their secret plans should be divulged .
 after burning mattium , the capital of the tribe , and ravaging the open country , germanicus marched back towards the rhine , the enemy not daring to harass the rear of the retiring army , which was his usual practice whenever he fell back by way of stratagem rather than from panic
 hostilities had ceased everywhere , but a considerable number of the senate , who had accompanied otho from rome , and had been afterwards left at mutina , encountered the utmost peril
letters are immediately sent to caesar by cicero , great rewards being offered if they carried them through .
the next day , according to his custom , caesar led out his forces from both camps , and having advanced a little from the larger one , drew up his line of battle , and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting .
 while , however , he relieved the honourable poverty of the virtuous , he expelled from the senate or suffered voluntarily to retire spendthrifts whose vices had brought them to penury , like vibidius varro , marius nepos , appius appianus , cornelius sulla , and quintus vitellius
 however , let him leave rome , lose his property , and be outlawed
 if he prefers to fight , we do not refuse that alternative
 and so sinnaces , whose enmity to the prince i have already mentioned , drew into actual revolt his father abdageses and others , who had been secretly in his counsel , and were now after their continued disasters more eager to fight by degrees , many flocked to him who , having been kept in subjection by fear rather than by goodwill , took courage as soon as they found leaders
 in reward for this man's services , both to himself and the public , caesar presented to him two hundred thousand pieces of copper money , and declared him promoted from the eighth to the first centurion . 
 after him labienus spoke , as well to express his contempt of caesar's forces , as to extol pompey's scheme with the highest encomiums . 
 after this he sent messengers to tamper with the british auxiliaries and with the batavian cohorts , who , as i have before related , had been sent into germany , and were then stationed at mogontiacum
 a more formidable movement broke out among the aedui , proportioned to the greater wealth of the state and the distance of the force which should repress it
when these came to the roman fortifications , weeping , they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to receive them as slaves and relieve them with food .
 about the same time the emperor enrolled in the ranks of the patricians such senators as were of the oldest families , and such as had had distinguished ancestors there were now but scanty relics of the greater houses of romulus and of the lesser houses of lucius brutus , as they had been called , and those too were exhausted which the dictator caesar by the cassian and the emperor augustus by the saenian law had chosen into their place
which embassies caesar , because he was hastening into italy and illyricum , ordered to return to him at the beginning of the following summer .
 let the fortitude of so courageous an end be alike in both of us , but let there be more in your decease to win fame
 his troops occupied the plains of umbria and that portion of the picentine territory that is washed by the adriatic , and now the whole of italy was divided by the range of the apennines between vespasian and vitellius
 i will now describe the origin and occasion of the revolt of vitellius
 the things were true , and so were believed to have been said
among the latter was ariovistus , who meeting with a small vessel tied to the bank , escaped in it ; our horse pursued and slew all the rest of them .
 hence my purpose is to relate a few facts about augustus , more particularly his last acts , then the reign of tiberius , and all which follows , without either bitterness or partiality , from any motives to which i am far removed
 in the consulship of servius galba and lucius sulla , the emperor , after having long considered whom he was to choose to be husbands for his granddaughters , now that the maidens were of marriageable age , selected lucius cassius and marcus vinicius
 he would , it said , provide for the honours due to his father , and not leave the lifeless body , and this was the only public duty he now claimed
 for although he had driven before him armies and generals from rome , phraates had shown to augustus every token of reverence and had sent him some of his children , to cement the friendship , not so much from dread of us as from distrust of the loyalty of his countrymen
 the auxiliary gauls and germans were in the van , then the foot-archers , after them , four legions and caesar himself with two praetorian cohorts and some picked cavalry
 accordingly , suffering no time to intervene but what was necessary for a proper attention to be paid to the sick and wounded , he sent on all his baggage privately in the beginning of the night from his camp to apollonia , and ordered them not to halt till they had performed their journey ; and he detached one legion with them as a convoy . 
 according to caius plinius , the historian of the german wars , she stood at the extremity of the bridge , and bestowed praise and thanks on the returning legions
 valens even reproached them with having transferred the imperial power to otho , though it had so long before been entrusted to vitellius
 he gathered round him all whom he knew to cherish the memory of germanicus , and to be opposed to his enemies , dwelling repeatedly on the greatness of the general , with hints that the state was being threatened with an armed attack , and he put himself at the head of a strong force , prepared for battle
this space having intervened , the others resume courage so far as to venture to take their place on the fortifications and present the aspect of defenders .
 this was a narrow road amid vast swamps , which had formerly been constructed by lucius domitius on every side were quagmires of thick clinging mud , or perilous with streams
 then riding up to the army of germany , he stretched forth his hand , and implored them to recover their river bank and their camp by the slaughter of the foe
 he had thrown himself on our archers and was on the point of breaking through them , when the cohorts of the raeti , vendelici , and gauls faced his attack
 great was the reputation for brotherly affection , as well as for eloquence , which vipstanus messalla earned for himself on that day , by venturing , though not yet of senatorial age , to plead for his brother aquilius regulus
conflagrations are beheld in every quarter ; and although all bore this with great regret , yet they laid before themselves this consolation , that , as the victory was certain , they could quickly recover their losses .
 fix at fifty-six years the subsequent rule of the divine augustus over the state add tiberius's three-and-twenty years , the four years or less of caius , the twenty-eight years of claudius and nero , the one memorable long year of galba , otho , and vitellius , and the now six years of the present happy reign , during which vespasian has been fostering the public weal , and the result is that from cicero's death to our day is a hundred and twenty years , one man's life-time
 an unworthy jealousy made him the enemy of blaesus , whose illustrious character raised him far above one who was stained with every infamy he burst into the imperial chamber , and clasping to his bosom the emperor's son , fell at his knees
 at length on the arrival of the infantry and cavalry the folly of his plans became evident with so small a force , even had it been thoroughly loyal , he could not have made his way through the enemy , and the loyalty they had brought with them was not beyond suspicion
 in their councils an accusation may be preferred or a capital crime prosecuted
 every day afterward , caesar drew up his army on a level ground , and offered pompey battle , and led his legions almost close to pompey's camp ; and his front line was at no greater distance from the rampart than that no weapon from their engines could reach it . 
 these by a prescriptive privilege of the alexandrian army , used to demand the king's favorites to be put to death , pillage the properties of the rich to increase their pay , invest the king's palace , banish some from the kingdom , and recall others from exile . 
 after a rapid march they joined caecina
 caecina , who seemed to have left his cruelty and profligacy on the other side of the alps , advanced through italy with his army under excellent discipline
 accordingly , having encouraged his men to despise a vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken , he advanced against them full of confidence and spirit . 
 his father , camillus , had raised an armed insurrection in dalmatia , and the emperor in again sparing a hostile family sought the credit of clemency
 dwelling on one side of the chauci and chatti , the cherusci long cherished , unassailed , an excessive and enervating love of peace
 their food is herbs , their clothing skins , their bed the earth
 the balsam is a shrub
the method of battle in which the germans had practiced themselves was this there were 6 , 000 horse , and as many very active and courageous foot , one of whom each of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own protection by these they were constantly accompanied in their engagements ; to these the horse retired ; these on any emergency rushed forward ; if any one , upon receiving a very severe wound , had fallen from his horse , they stood around him : if it was necessary to advance further than usual , or to retreat more rapidly , so great , from practice , was their swiftness , that , supported by the manes of the horses , they could keep pace with their speed .
 yet as eagerly as ever they stripped the bodies of slaughtered kinsfolk , connexions , and brothers
 but a general survey inclines me to believe that the gauls established themselves in an island so near to them
 thus the attack fell upon the legions , who had lost their standards and were being cut down within the entrenchments , when the fortune of the day was suddenly changed by a reinforcement of fresh troops
of all which events , it seemed the most surprising , that the germans , who had crossed the rhine with this object , that they might plunder the territories of ambiorix , being led to the camp of the romans , rendered ambiorix a most acceptable service .
 and i implore you to think of my children , one of whom , cneius is in way implicated in my career , whatever it may have been , seeing that all this time he has been at rome , while the other , marcus piso , dissuaded me from returning to syria
 they demanded that marius celsus , consul elect , galba's faithful friend to the very last moment , should be led to execution , loathing his energy and integrity as if they were vices
 but when vespasian has once seized the throne , neither he , nor his friends , nor even his armies , will feel themselves secure till all rivalry has been extinguished
 it is , again , a singular advantage to us , due to divine providence , for a widow to be united to an emperor who has limited himself to his own lawful wives
caesar orders the legions which he had drawn up in front of the rampart to advance a little .
these assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated place in the territories of the carnutes , which is reckoned the central region of the whole of gaul .
 some delay indeed was occasioned by cumanus and felix for claudius on hearing the causes of the rebellion had given authority for deciding also the case of these procurators
 besides , he was moved with compassion for those citizens , who , he foresaw , must fall : and he had rather gain his object without any loss or injury to them . 
 they advanced in three divisions , one column straight from where they had halted along the via flaminia , another along the bank of the tiber , a third moved on the colline gate by the via salaria
 they did as they were bidden
 the common account is that they were buried in the general's tent , though according to some their bodies were flung outside the entrenchments for all to see
 soon afterwards , sinnaces reinforced the army , and abdageses , the mainstay of the party , came with the royal treasure and what belonged to the crown
 having concluded his speech , he disgraced some standard-bearers , and reduced them to the ranks ; for the whole army was seized with such grief at their loss and with such an ardent desire of repairing their disgrace , that not a man required the command of his tribune or centurion , but they imposed each on himself severer labors than usual as a punishment , and at the same time were so inflamed with eagerness to meet the enemy , that the officers of the first rank , sensibly affected at their entreaties , were of opinion that they ought to continue in their present posts , and commit their fate to the hazard of a battle . 
 tiberius , however , argued as if his power would be thus increased
 about five miles from the spot the germans rose upon them , and attacked them as they marched without thought of danger
 they resolved by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity of herba , on account of the advantages of its situation . 
 one musonius rufus , a man of equestrian rank , strongly attached to the pursuit of philosophy and to the tenets of the stoics , had joined the envoys
he orders cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of the senones , lest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper , or out of the hatred of the state which he had incurred .
 they pointed out too the raised ground from which arminius had harangued his army , the number of gibbets for the captives , the pits for the living , and how in his exultation he insulted the standards and eagles
 the train moved on in silence like a long funeral procession
 the first and second lines confined under arms , as was from the first appointed . 
 it was not to villages or towns of armenia , but to a roman camp with two legions , a worthy recompense for their efforts , that they were bound
 he added some advice for meherdates , who was present , and told him not to be thinking of a despot and his slaves , but rather of a ruler among fellow citizens , and to practise clemency and justice which barbarians would like the more for being unused to them
 about the same time , the mountain between lake fucinus and the river liris was bored through , and that this grand work might be seen by a multitude of visitors , preparations were made for a naval battle on the lake , just as formerly augustus exhibited such a spectacle , in a basin he had made this side the tiber , though with light vessels , and on a smaller scale
 the destruction of messalina shook the imperial house for a strife arose among the freedmen , who should choose a wife for claudius , impatient as he was of a single life and submissive to the rule of wives
 but those magistrates and nobles who intrude on you against your wishes and consult you on all matters , openly give out that you have long overstepped the rank of a knight and gone far beyond my father's friendships , and from their dislike of you they also condemn me
then these leaders and chiefs of the nervii , who had any intimacy and grounds of friendship with cicero , say they desire to confer with him .
 rome , sated with her glory , had reached such a height that , she wished even foreign nations to enjoy repose
the signal having been immediately given by fires , as caesar had previously commended , a rush was made thither from the nearest fort ; and the battle was fought by the enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fought by brave men , in the last hope of safety , in a disadvantageous place , and against those who were throwing their weapons from a rampart and from towers ; since all hope of safety depended on their courage alone .
 courage , strength , even the eye with its keenest sight , were of no avail
 but there are , as i said but now , instances close at hand , and we may know them , not by hearsay , but may see them with our eyes the lower and meaner their birth , the more notorious the poverty and the straitened means amid which their life began , the more famous and brilliant are they as examples to show the efficacy of an orator's eloquence without the recommendation of birth , without the support of riches , neither of the two distinguished for virtue , one even despised for the appearance of his person , they have now for many years been the most powerful men in the state , and , as long as it suited them , they were the leaders of the bar at this moment , as leading men in the emperor's friendship they carry all before them , and even the leading man himself of the state esteems and almost reverences them vespasian indeed , venerable in his old age and most tolerant of truth , knows well that while his other friends are dependent on what he has given them , and on what it is easy for him to heap and pile on others , marcellus and crispus , in becoming his friends , brought with them something which they had not received and which could not be received from a prince
 there by the same practices he drew on himself , fresh odium and revived the old stripped of his property and outlawed , he wore out his old age on the rock of seriphos
 the centurion sisenna , who was the bearer of the clasped right hands , the usual emblems of friendship , from the armies of syria to the praetorians , was assailed by him with various artifices , till he left the island secretly , and , fearing actual violence , made his escape with all haste
 i really mean now to deal with the subject more boldly and confidently , but i must first observe that the types and varieties of eloquence change with the age
 corsica , sardinia , and the other islands of the neighbouring seas , were retained in the interests of otho by the fame of these naval successes
 this was the motive alleged , and it sounded well , but what every one said to himself was this 
 in her presence it was the last offence to utter an unseemly word or to do a disgraceful act
 but these reflections on the character of ancient and modern times have carried me too far from my subject
 search was then made for all the chief mutineers some as they roamed outside the camp were cut down by the centurions or by soldiers of the praetorian cohorts
 he orders all the forces raised every where by the new levies to repair to him . 
 and even he himself , though usually artificial in manner , and though his words escaped him with a seeming struggle , spoke out freely and fluently whenever he came to a man's rescue
when the fight was going on most vigorously before the fortifications , pullo , one of them , says , why do you hesitate , vorenus ? or what opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek ? this very day shall decide our disputes .
 such a beginning raised the hopes of the country , and all who wished for war approved the precedent , and anxiously watched the temper of the new governor
 it is naturally a fluid of dark colour
 had not night stopped the conflict , the siege would have been begun and finished within one day
 everything , senators , which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity , was once new
 it was the same with the emperor vescularius atticus and julius marinus were hurried off to execution , two of his oldest friends , men who had followed him to rhodes and been his inseparable companions at capreae
 in the other case , the limb , which had fallen into a diseased condition , might be restored , if a healing influence were applied
 when caecina and valens had united their forces , the vitellianists had no longer any reason to delay giving battle with their whole strength otho deliberated as to whether protracting the war or risking an engagement were the better course
 then did roman soldiers rush forward like men who had to drive a vologeses or pacorus from the ancestral throne of the arsacidae , not as though they were hastening to murder their aged and defenceless emperor in all the terror of their arms , and at the full speed of their horses , they burst into the forum , thrusting aside the crowd and trampling on the senate
lastly , who would persuade himself of this , that ambiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without sure grounds ? that his own opinion was safe on either side ; if there be nothing very formidable , they would go without danger to the nearest legion ; if all gaul conspired with the germans , their only safety lay in dispatch .
but the sugambri , at the very time the bridge was begun to be built , made preparations for a flight , and quitted their territories , and conveyed away all their possessions , and concealed themselves in deserts and woods .
 the civil war began with vitellius he was the first cause of our contending in arms for the throne
 to leave some months of office open for valens and caecina , the consulates of others were abridged , that of martius macer was ignored on the ground of his having been one of otho's generals
 that sect of his gave birth to the tuberones and favonii , names hateful even to the old republic
 seldom is it that two or three states meet together to ward off a common danger
 by this time the fleet had arrived , and caesar , having sent on his supplies and assigned vessels for the legions and the allied troops , entered drusus's fosse , as it was called he prayed drusus his father to lend him , now that he was venturing on the same enterprise , the willing and favourable aid of the example and willing and favorable aid of the example and memory of his counsels and achievements , and he arrived after a prosperous voyage through the lakes and the ocean as far as the river amisia
 and thus these mighty beginnings , which had embroiled italy , and kept the magistrates employed , found a speedy and happy issue . 
 if you repent your bounty , i give it back to you ; restore to me my former name that you may not appear to have conferred the honor on me as a reproach . 
 they had inflicted many losses on each other so continuously and so savagely that they could not have been fighting only for nero or galba
 there will be vices as long as there are men but they are not perpetual , and they are compensated by the occurrence of better things
 the cavalry and the auxiliaries chose their position themselves
 there too father bacchus , when victorious in war , pardoned the suppliant amazons who had gathered round the shrine
they rise from the council , detain both , and entreat , that they do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their dissension and obstinacy ; the affair was an easy one , if only they all thought and approved of the same thing , whether they remain or depart ; on the other hand , they saw no security in dissension .
 such was the state of the roman world , when servius galba , consul for the second time , with t vinius for his colleague , entered upon a year , which was to be the last of their lives , and which well nigh brought the commonwealth to an end
 when caesar gave him his liberty , he went over to africa ; now , curio had transported to africa those legions which caesar had received under his command a short time before at corfinium ; so that the officers and companies were still the same , excepting the change of a few centurions . 
 the women have the same dress as the men , except that they generally wrap themselves in linen garments , which they embroider with purple , and do not lengthen out the upper part of their clothing into sleeves the upper and lower arm is thus bare , and the nearest part of the bosom is also exposed
 marsus too was distinguished by the honours of his ancestors and by his own attainments
the matter is prolonged by debate till midnight .
 mucianus , seeing that antonius could not be openly crushed , heaped many praises upon him in the senate , and loaded him with promises in secret , holding out as a prize the government of eastern spain , then vacant in consequence of the departure of cluvius rufus
 fear and terror there certainly are , feeble bonds of attachment
 luceria was his native place
 nor could they be extinguished by the fall of rain , or by river-water , or by any other moisture , till some countrymen , in despair of a remedy and in fury at the disaster , flung stones from a distance , and then , approaching nearer , as the flames began to sink , tried to scare them away , like so many wild beasts , with the blows of clubs and other weapons
 scattered through all parts of italy , and mingled with the conquerors , they spoke the language of enemies
 for a brief space the prince's hopes rose then his frame became exhausted , and , as his end drew near , he spoke as follows to the friends by his side 
 cerialis , having thus all but ruined everything by his carelessness , restored the day by his resolution
 could a community be found in which no one did wrong , an orator would be as superfluous among its innocent people as a physician among the healthy
 curio , censuring both measures , said , that the one was as deficient in spirit , as the other exceeded in it : that the latter advised a shameful flight , and the former recommended us to engage at a great disadvantage . 
but when ariovistus saw them before him in his camp , he cried out in the presence of his army , why were they come to him ? was it for the purpose of acting as spies ? he stopped them when attempting to speak , and cast them into chains .
 the vessel had not gone far , agrippina having with her two of her intimate attendants , one of whom , crepereius gallus , stood near the helm , while acerronia , reclining at agrippina's feet as she reposed herself , spoke joyfully of her son's repentance and of the recovery of the mother's influence , when at a given signal the ceiling of the place , which was loaded with a quantity of lead , fell in , and crepereius was crushed and instantly killed
 nero after having butchered so many illustrious men , at last aspired to extirpate virtue itself by murdering thrasea paetus and barea soranus
there is a panic in the entire camp , and one inquires of another the cause of the confusion , nor do they readily determine whither the standards should be borne , nor into what quarter each should betake himself .
therefore , in such an unfavorable state of affairs , various events of fortune followed .
 a morass was in the enemy's rear , and the romans were hemmed in by the river or by the hills
 seneca replied that natalis had been sent to him and had complained to him in piso's name because of his refusal to see piso , upon which he excused himself on the ground of failing health and the desire of rest
 phrases like fortune's wheel and verrine soup , i do not care to ridicule , or that stock ending of every third clause in all cicero's speeches , it would seem to be , brought in as the close of a period
 even in his will he did not , as did many in their last moments , flatter nero or tigellinus or any other of the men in power on the contrary , he described fully the prince's shameful excesses , with the names of his male and female companions and their novelties in debauchery , and sent the account under seal to nero
 the baggage-wagons and the camp-followers were mingled with the troops and as there were steep ditches on both sides the road , it would have been found too narrow even for an undisturbed advance
 the emperor was asked whether he would allow him to be buried , and he blushed not to grant the favour , and actually blamed the accident which had proved fatal to the accused before he could be convicted in his presence
 the noblest men , it was said , have the loftiest aspirations , and so hercules and bacchus among the greeks and quirinus among us were enrolled in the number of the gods
 thereupon fulcinius trio began with some old and irrelevant accusations about intrigues and extortion during piso's government of spain
 but , on the other hand , caesar could not place sufficient confidence in men so lately thrown into consternation , and thought he ought to allow them time to recover their dejected spirits ; and having abandoned his works , he was apprehensive of being distressed for want of corn . 
 it had its beginning in that part of the circus which adjoins the palatine and caelian hills , where , amid the shops containing inflammable wares , the conflagration both broke out and instantly became so fierce and so rapid from the wind that it seized in its grasp the entire length of the circus
 a force was next set over the conquered , and their groves , devoted to inhuman superstitions , were destroyed
 his vassals fight for their chief
 few cared for the honour of the state
they called this a lily from its resemblance to that flower .
 he corrupted a few of the men , but the majority were steadfast in their allegiance
 if last , i fear that i may differ from you unwillingly
 about the same time mucianus ordered the son of vitellius to be put to death , alleging that dissension would never cease , if he did not destroy all seeds of civil war
 there were two roads , one to ilerda , if they chose to return , the other to tarraco , if they should march to it . 
 after the young man departure there was comparative quiet , but there was an arrogant tone among the soldiers , to whom the fact that their commander's son was pleading their common cause clearly showed that they had wrested by compulsion what they had failed to obtain by good behaviour
in proportion as the attack became daily more formidable and violent , and particularly , because , as a great number of the soldiers were exhausted with wounds , the matter had come to a small number of defenders , more frequent letters and messages were sent to caesar ; a part of which messengers were taken and tortured to death in the sight of our soldiers .
the supreme command is intrusted to camalugenus one of the aulerci , who , although almost worn out with age , was called to that honor on account of his extraordinary knowledge of military tactics .
by these means he makes his departure like a retreat .
 roused by so significant and strange an appearance , ptolemy disclosed the vision of the night to the egyptian priests , whose business it is to understand such matters
 then the vitellianists , whose capitulation at bovillae i have already related , and the other troops of the party , who had been collected from the capital and its neighbourhood , were brought forth almost naked
 that same year , some states of gaul , under the pressure of heavy debts , attempted a revolt its most active instigators were julius florus among the treveri and julius sacrovir among the aedui
 they often kill them , not in enforcing strict discipline , but on the impulse of passion , as they would an enemy , only it is done with impunity
 it mattered not whether he had sinned so greatly from choice or compulsion
 is it that they are in fear themselves , or are a fear to others
caesar , having accomplished the object which he had in view , ordered the signal to be sounded for a retreat ; and the soldiers of the tenth legion , by which he was then accompanied , halted .
 civilis , retaining a part of his forces , sent the veteran cohorts and the bravest of his german troops against vocula and his army , under the command of julius maximus and claudius victor , his sister's son
 there upon seneca , not to thwart her noble ambition , from an affection too which would not leave behind him for insult one whom he dearly loved , replied 
over these people viridovix ruled , and held the chief command of all those states which had revolted ; from which he had collected a large and powerful army and in those few days , the aulerci and the lexovii , having slain their senate because they would not consent to be promoters of the war , shut their gates and united themselves to viridovix ; a great multitude besides of desperate men and robbers assembled out of gaul from all quarters , whom the hope of plundering and the love of fighting had called away from husbandry and their daily labor .
 caesar , finding the road to dyrrachium already in the possession of pompey , was in no great haste , but encamped by the river apsus , in the territory of apollonia , that the states which had deserved his support might be certain of protection from his out-guards and forts ; and there he resolved to wait the arrival of his other legions from italy , and to winter in tents . 
 by that sortie the rhine might be reached
 the prince's prosperity he despises
 there were not wanting in the army itself the elements of civil strife the whole of it had taken part in the war against vindex it had not passed over to galba till nero fell even then in this transference of its allegiance it had been anticipated by the armies of lower germany besides this , the treveri , the lingones , and the other states which galba had most seriously injured by his severe edicts and by the confiscation of their territory , were particularly close to the winter-quarters of the legions thence arose seditious conferences , a soldiery demoralized by intercourse with the inhabitants of the country , and tendencies in favour of verginius , which could easily be to the profit of any other person
 there is no room for delay in a business which can only be approved when it is done
 silence might seem contumacious , and frankness might provoke suspicion , and otho , who had lately been a subject , and had used the same language , was familiar with flattery accordingly , they discussed various motions on which they had put many constructions vitellius they called a public enemy and a traitor to his country , the more prudent contenting themselves with hackneyed terms of abuse , though some threw out reproaches founded in truth , yet only did so in the midst of clamour , and when many voices were heard at once , drowning their own speech in a tumult of words
 if only the legates of the legions were put to death , the remaining multitude , moved by the consciousness of guilt and the hope of escape , would readily join their cause
 he then sketched the plan of his future government , carefully avoiding anything which had kindled recent odium
 for themselves , they found that the promises held out by the laws , for which they had long waited , were turned into mockery , when one who knew nothing of a parent's solicitude or of the sorrows of bereavement could rise in a moment to the level of a father's long deferred hopes on this , a decree of the senate was passed that a fictitious adoption should be of no avail in any department of the public service , or even hold good for acquiring an inheritance
 the consul and the praetor retained their prestige
 quiet being thus restored for the present , a no less formidable difficulty remained through the turbulence of the fifth and twenty-first legions , who were in winter quarters sixty miles away at old camp , as the place was called
 the two , it was decided , were to be attacked , but sabinus was to be put off for a time varro , the consul , was let loose on them , who , under colour of a hereditary feud , humoured the malignity of sejanus to his own disgrace
 then it was that roman knights were first enrolled under the title of augustani , men in their prime and remarkable for their strength , some , from a natural frivolity , others from the hope of promotion
 to this he added a few words of the cause for which they fought , and of his own forces and resources . 
 there were formerly certain colonnades on the right side of the slope as one went up the defenders , issuing forth on the roof of these buildings , showered tiles and stones on the vitellianists
 there was no place left them from which the materials for their mound could be fetched , in consequence of all the timber , far and wide , in the territories of the massilians , having been cut down and carried away ; they began therefore to make an agger of a new construction , never heard of before , of two walls of brick , each six feet thick , and to lay floors over them of almost the same breadth with the agger , made of timber . 
 thus the preparations of vitellius became known , while the plans of vespasian were for the most part kept secret at first the supineness of vitellius was in fault afterwards the occupation of the pannonian alps with troops stopped all intelligence
 caesar made a public oration at corduba , in which he returned thanks to all severally : to the roman citizens , because they had been zealous to keep the town in their own power ; to the spaniards , for having driven out the garrison ; to the gaditani , for having defeated the attempts of his enemies , and asserted their own liberty ; to the tribunes and centurions who had gone there as a guard , for having by their valor confirmed them in their purpose . 
 he likewise gave directions that search should be made for whatever corn was in lissus , the country of the parthini , and all the places of strength . 
 people were incriminated for some casual remark in the forum or at the dinner-table , for every one was impatient to be the first to mark his victim , some to screen themselves , most from being , as it were , infected with the contagion of the malady
 from britain he went to rome , to go through the regular course of office , and there allied himself with domitia decidiana , a lady of illustrious birth the marriage was one which gave a man ambitious of advancement distinction and support
 custom adapts itself to expediency , and this novelty will hereafter take its place among recognized usages
 this , he said , would bring prosperity to the realm , and great and illustrious would be the city which gave it a reception
 then , as if he was going to describe successes in war , he summoned the senate , and awarded triumphal honours to petronius turpilianus , an ex-consul , to cocceius nerva , praetor-elect , and to tigellinus , commander of the praetorians tigellinus and nerva he so distinguished as to place busts of them in the palace in addition to triumphal statues in the forum
 the rule of pompeius and of crassus soon yielded before caesar the arms of lepidus and antonius before augustus who , when the world was wearied by civil strife , subjected it to empire under the title of prince
 they assemble , except in the case of a sudden emergency , on certain fixed days , either at new or at full moon
 the strength and power of oratory , unlike all other arts , is not confined within narrow and straitened limits , but the orator is he who can speak on every question with grace , elegance , and persuasiveness , suitably to the dignity of his subject , the requirements of the occasion , and the taste of his audience
 didius was succeeded by veranius , who died within the year
 besides , lucius metellus , one of the tribunes , was suborned by caesar's enemies , to prevent this , and to embarrass every thing else which caesar should propose . 
 fearing that their superior numbers and their knowledge of the country might enable them to hem him in , he too distributed his forces into three divisions , and so advanced
 plancina too , instead of keeping herself within the proper limits of a woman , would be present at the evolutions of the cavalry and the manoeuvres of the cohorts , and would fling insulting remarks at agrippina and germanicus
the work is carried on incessantly in the night : not even to the sick , or wounded , is opportunity given for rest : whatever things are required for resisting the assault of the next day are provided during the night : many stakes burned at the end , and a large number of mural pikes are procured : towers are built up , battlements and parapets are formed of interwoven hurdles .
this discussion having been held on the two sides , when opposition was offered strenuously by cotta and the principal officers , prevail , said sabinus , if so you wish it ; and he said it with a louder voice , that a great portion of the soldiers might hear him ; nor am i the person among you , he said , who is most powerfully alarmed by the danger of death ; these will be aware of it , and then , if any thing disastrous shall have occurred , they will demand a reckoning at your hands ; these , who , if it were permitted by you , united three days hence with the nearest winter-quarters , may encounter the common condition of war with the rest , and not , as if forced away and separated far from the rest , perish either by the sword or by famine .
the neighboring people led on by their influence , detain trebius and terrasidius for the same motive ; and quickly sending embassadors , by means of their leading men , they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except by general consent , and abide the same issue of fortune ; and they solicit the other states to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they had received from their ancestors , than endure slavery under the romans .
 intent as he had once been on the cares of state , he was now for thoroughly unbending himself in secret profligacy and a leisure of malignant schemes
 then returning to the camp , he saw the broken companies of the legions , which had been captured at bonna and novesium , with but few soldiers round the standards , and the eagles all but surrounded by the foe
 votienus was charged with insulting expressions towards the emperor , and while the witness , aemilius , a military man , in his eagerness to prove the case , repeated the whole story and amid angry clamour struggled on with loud assertion , tiberius heard the reproaches by which he was assailed in secret , and was so deeply impressed that he exclaimed that he would clear himself either at once or on a legal inquiry , and the entreaties of friends , with the flattery of the whole assembly , hardly restored his composure
 he reproached other men with being cowards
 it was believed by many persons that one of the freedmen employed on confidential services was sent to agricola , bearing a despatch in which syria was offered him , and with instructions to deliver it should he be in britain
 he next assigned some very vague reasons for his absence , then passed to more important matters , the ill-will against him originating in his state policy , and requested that macro , who commanded the praetorians , with a few tribunes and centurions , might accompany him whenever he entered the senate-house
 that same year the emperor put into possession of the latin franchise the tribes of the maritime alps
 claudius then again appointed quaestors , and that they might not be too lax in their duties from fear of offending , he promised them promotion out of the usual course
 his father , after venturing on many acts of hostility , had scorned with impunity the ridiculous expedition of caligula
 hereupon , urged by want of fodder , that they might be the readier for a march , they killed all their baggage cattle . 
 this alarmed nero , and he wrote a letter to plautus , bidding him consider the tranquillity of rome and withdraw himself from mischievous gossip
 those , on the contrary , whom he hated , had to struggle with danger and humiliation
 in other parts of the town , they fought so obstinately , that they quitted the field with equal advantage , and neither were beaten in consequence of the narrowness of the passes ; and a few being killed on both sides , caesar secured the most necessary posts , and fortified them in the night . 
 for , even as it then was , the commander was still obeyed by the centurions and by all the best men among the soldiers
 sophonius tigellinus , a man of obscure birth , steeped in infamy from his boyhood , and shamelessly profligate in his old age , finding vice to be his quickest road to such offices as the command of the watch and of the praetorian guard , and to other distinctions due to merit , went on to practise cruelty , rapacity , and all the crimes of maturer years he perverted nero to every kind of atrocity he even ventured on some acts without the emperor's knowledge , and ended by deserting and betraying him
 all these proposals were rejected , and opposition made to them all , in the speeches of the consul , scipio , and cato . 
but when the issue of the victory was still uncertain , and the circumstances which were taking place on the left wing were announced to the tribunes of the seventh legion , they faced about their legion to the enemy's rear and attacked it : not even then did any one retreat , but all were surrounded and slain .
 he was raising levies of roman citizens , among the lucani and brutii , by his lieutenants , and exacting a certain quota of horse and foot from the states of sicily . 
 and so cumanus was condemned for the crimes which the two had committed , and tranquillity was restored to the province
 in great exultation he returned to rome , and before a crowded assembly of the people heaped praises on the dutiful obedience of the soldiers
 about six hundred were wounded of afranius's party there were killed titus caecilius , principal centurion , and four other centurions , and above two hundred men . 
and while the attention of our men is engaged in that matter , in another part adiatunnus , who held the chief command , with 600 devoted followers whom they call soldurii ; adiatunnus , endeavoring to make a sally with these , when our soldiers had rushed together to arms , upon a shout being raised at that part of the , fortification , and a fierce battle had been fought there , was driven back into the town , yet he obtained from crassus that he should enjoy the same terms of surrender .
this side is considered to be 800 miles in length .
 without the recklessness with which young men often make the profession of arms a mere pastime , and without indolence , he never availed himself of his tribune's rank or his inexperience to procure enjoyment or to escape from duty
 they were preceded by the standards unadorned and the faces reversed
 such , he said , was his arrangement with caecina caecina , however , being with the army in person , and consequently having greater influence , pretended that this plan had been changed , so that the gathering forces of the enemy might be met with their whole strength
 let daylight come , they said , let battle be given
 nor are they taught various evolutions after our fashion , but are driven straight forward , or so as to make one wheel to the right in such a compact body that none is left behind another
 there is a war , forsooth , or he is kept from us in some remote part of the world
 it was not one alone who spoke thus , as did percennius among the legions of pannonia , nor was it in the ears of trembling soldiers , who looked with apprehension to other and mightier armies , but there was sedition in many a face and voice
 when curio perceived that in the general consternation neither his exhortations nor entreaties were attended to , imagining that the only hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to gain the nearest hills , he ordered the colors to be borne that way . 
after he saw that this request was firmly refused him , all hope of success being lost , he began to tamper with the chief persons of the gauls , to call them apart singly and exhort them to remain on the continent ; to agitate them with the fear that it was not without reason that gaul should be stripped of all her nobility ; that it was caesar's design , to bring over to britain and put to death all those whom he feared to slay in the sight of gaul , to pledge his honor to the rest , to ask for their oath that they would by common deliberation execute what they should perceive to be necessary for gaul .
 the despotisms of cinna and sulla were brief
 let him enjoy the wages of his crimes and his impunity , but let him leave vespasian to worthier advisers
 there was a story that vespasian was insulted by phoebus , a freedman , for closing his eyes in a doze , and that having with difficulty been screened by the intercessions of the well disposed , he escaped imminent destruction through his grander destiny
 every night had its anxieties , for his sleepless hours , his dreams and sighs were all made known by his wife to her mother livia and by livia to sejanus
 vitellius is our emperor to him we will retain our fealty and devote our swords till our last breath
 rome , he said , is not now , as formerly , beset with wars , nor are the provinces hostile
on discovering these things the chiefs of britain , who had come up after the battle was fought to perform those conditions which caesar had imposed , held a conference , when they perceived that cavalry , and ships , and corn were wanting to the romans , and discovered the small number of our soldiers from the small extent of the camp , and thought that the best plan was to renew the war , and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract the affair till winter ; because they felt confident , that , if they were vanquished or cut off from a return , no one would afterward pass over into britain for the purpose of making war .
 they are dismal and uncouth , and the very soundness of which they boast , is the result not so much of real vigour as of fasting
when caesar discovered this , having already accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved to lead his army over , namely , to strike fear into the germans , take vengeance on the sugambri , and free the ubii from the invasion of the suevi , having spent altogether eighteen days beyond the rhine , and thinking he had advanced far enough to serve both honor and interest , he returned into gaul , and cut down the bridge .
 at rome , however , there was no alarm
 he annuls laws
over that fort and guard he appointed c .
 but the legions , having been concentrated to act against vindex , and having thus learnt to measure their own strength against the strength of gaul , were now on the lookout for another war and for new conflicts
 he knew everything , but did not always act on his knowledge
 though caesar highly approved of collecting a fleet , and crossing the sea , and pursuing pompey before he could strengthen himself with his transmarine auxiliaries , with the hope of bringing the war to a conclusion , yet he dreaded the delay and length of time necessary to effect it : because pompey , by collecting all his ships , had deprived him of the means of pursuing him at present . 
 in the campus martius also the hostile armies met , the flavianists with all the prestige of fortune and repeated victory , the vitellianists rushing on in sheer despair

 i was , said he , too formidable to nero , and i must not look for another lusitania , another honourable exile
 for whole legions were no longer transplanted , as in former days , with tribunes and centurions and soldiers of every grade , so as to form a state by their unity and mutual attachment , but strangers to one another from different companies , without a head or any community of sentiment , were suddenly gathered together , as it might be out of any other class of human beings , and became a mere crowd rather than a colony

 when they were collected , leaving behind him his neighboring enemies , the parthians who shortly before had killed marcus crassus , the imperator , and had kept marcus bibulus besieged , he drew his legions and cavalry out of syria ; and when he came into the province , which was under great anxiety and fear of the parthian war , and heard some declarations of the soldiers , that they would march against an enemy , if he would lead them on ; but would never bear arms against a countryman and consul ; he drew off his legions to winter quarters to pergamus , and the most wealthy cities , and made them rich presents : and in order to attach them more firmly to his interest , permitted them to plunder the cities . 
 so , at first , there were clamorous meetings and importunate entreaties then noisy applications to the praetor's court and the very device intended as a remedy , the sale and purchase of estates , proved the contrary , as the usurers had hoarded up all their money for buying land

 but the greatness of the works , the height of the wall and towers , and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works . 
 if , again , he offers his audience , not without some tremblings at heart , the result of a fresh and sudden effort , his very anxiety enhances the joy of success , and ministers to his pleasure
 encouraged by this address , lentulus begged leave to return to the town , that the security which he had obtained for himself might be an encouragement to the rest to hope for theirs ; saying that some were so terrified that they were induced to make desperate attempts on their own lives . 
a few escaping from the battle , made their way to labienus at winter-quarters , after wandering at random through the woods , and inform him of these events .
 neither could the states , which had espoused caesar's cause , furnish him with corn , nor the troops , which had gone far to forage , return , as they were stopped by the waters : nor could the convoys , coming from italy and gaul , make their way to the camp .

 what then is my meaning
 faenius could not meet this with either speech or silence halting in his words and visibly terror-stricken , while the rest , especially cervarius proculus , a roman knight , did their utmost to convict him , he was , at the emperor's bidding , seized and bound by cassius , a soldier , who because of his well-known strength of limb was in attendance

 caius silanus , pro-consul of asia , was accused by our allies of extortion whereupon mamercus scaurus , an ex-consul , junius otho , a praetor , brutidius niger , an aedile , simultaneously fastened on him and charged him with sacrilege to the divinity of augustus , and contempt of the majesty of tiberius , while mamercus scaurus quoted old precedents , the prosecutions of lucius cotta by scipio africanus , of servius galba by cato the censor and of publius rutilius by scaurus
 the soil poisoned with blood forbade the enemy to remain long by the ruins of the buried city
 when , however , these persons were worthless , he was even culpably blind
 the titles of the laws passed , the names of the nations conquered by augustus were to be borne in front , on that of lucius arruntius

 vonones himself too further provoked their disdain , by his contrast with their ancestral manners , by his rare indulgence in the chase , by his feeble interest in horses , by the litter in which he was carried whenever he made a progress through their cities , and by his contemptuous dislike of their national festivities
 libo , vexed at the distress and disgrace , departed from brundusium , and abandoned the blockade . 
having related the exploit and roused the aduatuci , the next day he arrived among the nervii , and entreats that they should not throw away the opportunity of liberating themselves forever and of punishing the romans for those wrongs which they had received from them ; that two lieutenants have been slain , and that a large portion of the army has perished ; that it was not a matter of difficulty for the legion which was wintering with cicero to be cut off , when suddenly assaulted ; he declares himself ready to cooperate in that design .

 se priora et totiens iactata super obtineneda armenia nunc omittere , quoniam dii , quamvis potentium populorum arbitri , possessionem parthis non sine ignominia romana tradidissent
 it was currently reported in after times that while the emperor broke into contradictory exclamations , now inveighing against the infamies of his wife , and now , returning in thought to the remembrance of his love and of his infant children , vitellius said nothing but , what audacity ! what wickedness ! narcissus indeed kept pressing him to clear up his ambiguities and let the truth be known , but still he could not prevail upon him to utter anything that was not vague and susceptible of any meaning which might be put on it , or upon largus caecina , to do anything but follow his example

 there he adored the gods then he entered also the temple of vesta , and there feeling a sudden trembling throughout his limbs , either from terror inspired by the deity or because , from the remembrance of his crimes , he was never free from fear , he relinquished his purpose , repeatedly saying that all his plans were of less account than his love of his country

 the next day , as if he were addressing the senate and people of another state , he pronounced a high panegyric on himself , extolling his own energy and moderation , though his enormities were known to the very persons who were present and to the whole of italy , his progress through which had been disgraced by sloth and profligacy yet the mob , who had no patriotic anxieties , and who , without distinguishing between truth and falsehood , had learnt the lesson of habitual flattery , applauded him with shouts and acclamations , and , reluctant as he was to assume the name of augustus , extorted from him a compliance as idle as his previous refusal

 caecina himself turned aside to ravenna , on the pretext that he wished to address the fleet
 the scene was a contrast to all civil wars which have ever occurred

 enough and more than enough blunders , they said , had been made by granting discharges and money , indeed , by conciliatory measures even if germanicus held his own life cheap , why should he keep a little son and a pregnant wife among madmen who outraged every human right
 for he too will be a part of rome's calamities
 when caesar perceived this , he gave the signal to his fourth line , which he had formed of the six cohorts . 
 but he did not thereby create a belief in his patriotism , for he had revived the law of treason , the name of which indeed was known in ancient times , though other matters came under its jurisdiction , such as the betrayal of an army , or seditious stirring up of the people , or , in short , any corrupt act by which a man had impaired the majesty of the people of rome

 they replied that they would hear better as they were
 but the soldiers of the veteran legion , who had also struggled , not only with the inclemency of the weather , but by laboring at the pump , thought it their duty to remit nothing of their former valor : and having protracted the beginning of the night in settling the terms , under pretense of surrendering , they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground : and having got a convenient place on the shore , they spent the rest of the night there , and at day-break , when otacilius had sent against them a party of the horse , who guarded that part of the coast , to the number of four hundred , beside some armed men , who had followed them from the garrison , they made a brave defense , and having killed some of them , retreated in safety to our army . 
 idly , he said have you challenged the vitellianists with threatening words , if you cannot abide their attack or even their looks so he spoke to each as he approached them the third legion he addressed at greater length , reminding them of old and recent achievements , how under marcus antonius they had defeated the parthians , under corbulo the armenians , and had lately discomfited the sarmatians

 it is for a brother and for a brother's children that i have come hither with my prayers and tears it is idle to fear vespasian , when there are so many legions of germany , so many provinces with their valour and their loyalty , and lastly , so vast an extent of sea and land with enormous distances , to keep him from us
 i find in the registers of the senate that cerialis anicius , consul-elect , proposed a motion that a temple should as soon as possible be built at the public expense to the divine nero
 with the romans the fortune of the day varied , and the most violently mutinous shewed themselves cowards

 he preferred to give office and power to men who would not transgress , rather than have to condemn a transgressor
 those whose business it is take it with the hand , and draw it on to the deck of the boat it then continues of itself to flow in and lade the vessel till the stream is cut off nor can this be done by any instrument of brass or iron

 mucianus now brought forward as a new thought a plan he had long concealed
 tiberius deferred any investigation into the priest's legal position , but he modified the ceremonies which had been decreed in honour of drusus's tribunitian power with special censure on the extravagance of the proposed inscription in gold , so contrary to national usage

 they refused all rest they would not wait for their general
 as for the impeachment of barea soranus , ostorius sabinus , a roman knight , had already claimed it for himself it arose out of his proconsulate of asia , where he increased the prince's animosity by his uprightness and diligence , as well as by having bestowed pains on opening the port of ephesus and passed over without punishment the violence of the citizens of pergamos in their efforts to hinder acratus , one of the emperor's freedmen , from carrying off statues and pictures

this speech was not disagreeable to the gauls , principally , because he himself was not disheartened by receiving so severe a loss , and had not concealed himself , nor shunned the eyes of the people : and he was believed to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than the rest , because , when the affair was undecided , he had at first been of opinion that avaricum should be burnt , and afterward that it should be abandoned .
 when it was notorious that the emperor was the assailant , and the insults on men and women of distinction were multiplied , other persons too on the strength of a licence once granted under nero's name , ventured with impunity on the same practices , and had gangs of their own , till night presented the scenes of a captured city
