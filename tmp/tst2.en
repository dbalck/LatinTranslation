 a barricade had been raised before the gates , at which a short contest was maintained , our men endeavoring to force their way in , and the enemy to defend the camp ; titus pulcio , by whose means we have related that caius antonius's army was betrayed , defending them with singular courage . 
 caecina , having embraced vitellius and received tokens of high distinction , left him , and sent a detachment of cavalry to occupy cremona
 every foot soldier still unwounded fled to remote wilds , and those who were disabled , returned to the camp , exaggerating in their terror the king's valour , and the warlike strength of his tribes , everything in short , to the simple credulity of those who trembled with like fear
 they had advanced to aquileia , and by roughly repulsing the messengers who brought the tidings of otho's defeat , by tearing the colours which displayed the name of vitellius , by finally seizing on the military chest and dividing it among themselves , had assumed a hostile attitude
in the same place , the cavalry of the whole of gaul , in number 4 , 000 , assembles , and the chief persons of all the states ; he had determined to leave in gaul a very few of them , whose fidelity toward him he had clearly discerned , and take the rest with him as hostages ; because he feared a commotion in gaul when he should be absent .
 he could no longer be restrained , when seneca and burrus thought it best to concede one point that he might not persist in both
 even caius caesar's disordered intellect did not wholly mar his faculty of speech
 the palm-groves are tall and graceful
 to interrupt his progress , they drew out their legions about the eighth hour , by a certain signal , and placed them in order of battle before their camp . 
 upon notice of his approach , thermus , distrusting the affections of the townsmen , drew his cohorts out of it and made his escape ; his soldiers deserted him on the road , and returned home . 
 after the death of lucanus , he rigorously called in the debts due to his estate , and thereby provoked an accuser in the person of fabius romanus , one of the intimate friends of lucanus
 during the consulship of memmius regulus and verginius rufus , nero welcomed with something more than mortal joy the birth of a daughter by poppaea , whom he called augusta , the same title having also been given to poppaea
 that freedmen's sons should be intrusted with public offices is not , as many wrongly think , a sudden innovation , but was a common practice in the old commonwealth
 your title also will be equally uncertain , so long as it shall be a question , whether it is the emperor of the roman people , or a public enemy , whom you have in your camp
 vitellius , who was standing before the steps of the palace , and was preparing to intercede , was induced to desist
they surrender vercingetorix , and lay down their arms .
the german war being finished , caesar thought it expedient for him to cross the rhine , for many reasons ; of which this was the most weighty , that , since he saw the germans were so easily urged to go into gaul , he desired they should have their fears for their own territories , when they discovered that the army of the roman people both could and dared pass the rhine .
 tiberius augusta refrained from showing themselves , thinking it below their dignity to shed tears in public , or else fearing that , if all eyes scrutinised their faces , their hypocrisy would be revealed
 the first revolt of which vitellius received tidings was that of the 3rd legion , despatches having been sent by aponius saturninus before he too attached himself to the party of vespasian
this day was by far the most calamitous to our men ; it had this result , however , that on that day the largest number of the enemy was wounded and slain , since they had crowded beneath the very rampart , and the hindmost did not afford the foremost a retreat .
indutiomarus having been slain , as we have stated , the government was conferred upon his relatives by the treviri .
 in summer it catches the western breezes , and the open sea round it renders it most delightful
 this had brought the leptitani to extremities their territories had been ravaged far and wide , and they were trembling within their walls , when the garamantes were put to flight by the arrival of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry , and the whole of the booty was recaptured , with the exception of some which the plunderers , in their wanderings through inaccessible hamlets , had sold to more distant tribes
the barbarians , espying our standard in the distance , desist from the attack ; at first they suppose that the legions , which they had learned from their prisoners had removed further off , had returned ; afterward , despising their small number , they make an attack on them at all sides .
 gaul always had its petty kingdoms and intestine wars , till you submitted to our authority
 successor to the julii , the claudii , the servii , have been the first to bring the imperial dignity into a new family
 iturius and calvisius , whom he had himself temporarily exiled , he now released from their penalty
having quickly collected an army by their punishments , he sends lucterius , one of the cadurci , a man the utmost daring , with part of his forces , into the territory of the ruteni ; and marches in person into the country of the bituriges .
 all that could be looked for was honour in death
 a dispute then arose between gallus and the emperor
 where , they asked , was the glory of the men who slew crassus , who drove out antonius , if caesar's drudge , after an endurance of so many years' slavery , were to rule over parthians
 there they learnt that three cohorts , belonging to vitellius , and the sebonian horse had taken up a position at the forum alieni , where they had thrown a bridge across the river
 a great part of the army remained at bedriacum these certainly were never vanquished
 night at last released the legions , which were now wavering , from a disastrous engagement
 only , they said , let us have the foe face to face
 while he deliberated what he was to do , his son , marcus piso , advised speedy return to rome
 he gives arms to the slaves that attended the flocks , and appoints horses for them of these he made up about three hundred horse . 
 civilis , who occupied the centre of the army with the elite of the batavian troops , wishing to add a new terror to his demonstration , covered both banks of the rhine with columns of his german allies , while his cavalry galloped about the plains
 caesar refreshed his army on the plain that he might not expose them to battle while fatigued ; and when the enemy attempted to renew their march , he pursued and stopped them . 
 its people had previously offered this same amount for the distresses of rome
 the walls of jerusalem were destroyed , the temple was left standing after these provinces had fallen , in the course of our civil wars , into the hands of marcus antonius , pacorus , king of the parthians , seized judaea
 they had triremes assigned them and crews specially selected to promote speed
which command having been most carefully obeyed , when any cohort had quitted the circle and made a charge , the enemy fled very precipitately .
 but this did not mitigate the hatred felt against mucianus
 so much so , that for many subsequent years nero prolonged his reign and his crimes still , to deepen the popular hatred towards his mother , and prove that since her removal , his clemency had increased , he restored to their ancestral homes two distinguished ladies , junia and calpurnia , with two ex-praetors , valerius capito and licinius gabolus , whom agrippina had formerly banished
 thereupon the frisii moved up their youth to the forests and swamps , and their non-fighting population , over the lakes , to the river-bank , and established themselves in unoccupied lands , reserved for the use of our soldiers , under the leadership of verritus and malorix , the kings of the tribe , as far as germans are under kings
they determine that ten thousand men should be picked out of the entire army and sent into the town , and decide that the general safety should not be intrusted to the bituriges alone , because they were aware that the glory of the victory must rest with the bituriges , if they made good the defense of the town .
 when they were fairly within the fortifications , the signal was given to the cohorts , and the horns and trumpets sounded
 not long afterwards some tribes of the wild population of cilicia , known as the clitae , which had often been in commotion , established a camp , under a leader troxobor , on their rocky mountains , whence rushing down on the coast , and on the towns , they dared to do violence to the farmers and townsfolk , frequently even to the merchants and shipowners
 from this as his starting-point he might cross into achaia , and there , winning the well-known and sacred garlands of antiquity , evoke , with increased fame , the enthusiasm of the citizens
 there upon panic seized the whole company and there was a general flight of the guests
 when tiberius asked him how he had become agrippa , he is said to have replied , as you became caesar
 and even these troops embarked very short of their number , because several had fallen in so many wars in gaul , and the long march from spain had lessened their number very much , and a severe autumn in apulia and the district about brundusium , after the very wholesome countries of spain and gaul , had impaired the health of the whole army . 
 nor indeed was there less restlessness among the partisans of vitellius , who were distracted by yet more fatal dissensions , springing , not from the suspicions of the common men , but from the treachery of the generals
 a show of gladiators was then given by fabius valens at bononia , with all the arrangements introduced from the capital
 there was no one to comfort or to go near her , except a few ladies , whether out of love or malice was doubtful
 part of the cavalry , and some of the auxiliary cohorts led the van
to this ariovistus replied , that the right of war was , that they who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered , in what manner they pleased ; that in that way the roman people were wont to govern the nations which they had conquered , not according to the dictation of any other , but according to their own discretion .
 there were some who thought him too eager for fame , and indeed the desire of glory is the last infirmity cast off even by the wise
 permission , he said , would be readily obtained
 sensible men , however , spoke variously of his life with praise and censure
accordingly , while the winter was not yet ended , having concentrated the four nearest legions , he marched unexpectedly into the territories of the nervii , and before they could either assemble or retreat , after capturing a large number of cattle and of men , and wasting their lands and giving up that booty to the soldiers , compelled them to enter into a surrender and give him hostages .
 thus the state had been revolutionised , and there was not a vestige left of the old sound morality
 for even honourable motives of action , unless directed by judgment , are followed by disastrous results
 as soon as he received the letter , he dismissed his attendants , and began to prepare for his journey to macedonia ; and a few days after set out . 
 this was the form of it : first , two beams of equal length were laid on the ground , at the distance of four feet from each other ; and in them were fastened small pillars , five feet high , which were joined together by braces , with a gentle slope , on which the timber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be laid : upon this were laid beams , two feet square , bound with iron plates and nails . 
 when he himself was on his road to casilinum , at the same time that his military standards and arms were seized at capua , his slaves seen at naples , and the design of betraying the town discovered : his plots being revealed , and capua shut against him , being apprehensive of danger , because the roman citizens residing there had armed themselves , and thought he ought to be treated as an enemy to the state , he abandoned his first design , and changed his route . 
 some men , seizing his hand under pretence of kissing it , thrust his fingers into their mouths , that he might touch their toothless gums
 the report of the surrender and kind reception of segestes , when generally known , was heard with hope or grief according as men shrank from war or desired it
 where is the mind once content with a humble lot is this the man who is building up his garden terraces , who paces grandly through these suburban parks , and revels in the affluence of such broad lands and such widely-spread investments
 varus , who had been made commander of the praetorian guard , had still at his disposal much military strength
 titus vespasian had been sent from judaea by his father while galba still lived , and alleged as a reason for his journey the homage due to the emperor , and his age , which now qualified him to compete for office but the vulgar , ever eager to invent , had spread the report that he was sent for to be adopted
our troops , as each man's post had been assigned him some days before , man the fortifications ; they intimidate the gauls by slings , large stones , stakes which they had placed along the works , and bullets .
 clemens , the centurion was summoned with all others who for their good qualities were liked by the common soldiers
 piso mockingly replied that he would be there as soon as the praetor who had to try poisoning cases had fixed a day for the accused and his prosecutors
 antonius , seeing that they gave way , charged them with a heavy column
 at the same time , cotus's cavalry , which used to infest the neighborhood of macedonia , flew to attack cassius's camp , at which cassius being alarmed , and having received information of scipio's approach , and seen the horse , which he imagined to be scipio's , he betook himself to the mountains that environ thessaly , and thence began to make his route toward ambracia . 
 silver and gold the gods have refused to them , whether in kindness or in anger i cannot say
a peace being established by these proceedings four days after we had come into britain , the eighteen ships , to which reference has been made above , and which conveyed the cavalry , set sail from the upper port with a gentle gale , when , however , they were approaching britain and were seen from the camp , so great a storm suddenly arose that none of them could maintain their course at sea ; and some were taken back to the same port from which they had started ; -others , to their great danger , were driven to the lower part of the island , nearer to the west ; which , however , after having cast anchor , as they were getting filled with water , put out to sea through necessity in a stormy night , and made for the continent .
 why should he hazard the loss of any of his men , even in a successful battle ? why should he expose soldiers to be wounded , who had deserved so well of him ? why , in short , should he tempt fortune ? especially when it was as much a general's duty to conquer by tactics as by the sword . 
 and on the sea the prevalent etesian winds favoured an eastward voyage , but hindered all return
 mucianus , who acted more as a colleague than as a servant of the emperor , moved on with some light-armed troops , not indeed at a tardy pace so as to give the appearance of delay , yet not with extraordinary speed thus he allowed rumour to gather fresh strength by distance , well aware that his force was but small , and that exaggerated notions are formed about what is not seen
 they however fearing to be hemmed in on one side by the romans , on the other by the cherusci , with whom they are perpetually at feud , sent envoys and hostages to rome
 about the same time lucilius bassus was sent with some light cavalry to establish order in campania , where the towns were still disturbed , but by mutual animosities rather than by any spirit of opposition to the new emperor
while the state , incensed at this act , was endeavoring to assert its right by arms , and the magistrates were mustering a large body of men from the country , orgetorix died ; and there is not wanting a suspicion , as the helvetii think , of his having committed suicide .
 afranius's men were distressed in foraging , and procured water with difficulty . 
 he asked for one day of truce before the final struggle , and said , that if they would permit some delay to intervene , everything might be more easily arranged
 from the town , indeed , the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near four hundred paces . 
 they had also been the first , they said , to build a temple in honour of rome , during the consulship of marcus porcius cato , when rome's power indeed was great , but not yet raised to the highest point , inasmuch as the punic capital was still standing and there were mighty kings in asia
 his accusers were satrius secundus and pinarius natta , creatures of sejanus
 one soldier , it was said , had suffered death for working at the trenches without his sword , another for wearing nothing as he dug , but his poniard
 narcissus persevered , only so far changing his plan as not to make her aware beforehand by a single word what was the charge or who was the accuser
having in the mean time assembled the legates and military tribunes , he told them both what he had learned from volusenus , and what he wished to be done ; and enjoined them that all things should be performed by them at a nod and at the instant .
on that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the senate at rome to beseech aid , as he alone was bound neither by oath nor hostages .
 by his order , the paramour's house was thrown open and the emperor conducted thither first , on the threshold , he pointed out the statue of silius's father , which a decree of the senate had directed to be destroyed
 vocula retired first to gelduba , after , wards to novesium civilis took possession of gelduba , and not long after was victorious in a cavalry engagement near novesium
the size , shape , and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen .
 he then fled on a swift horse , and reached a wooded country , where he parted with his steed and eluded pursuit amid rocky and pathless wilds
 this is a tribe which inhabits part of the island , and closely resembles the batavians in their origin , their language , and their courageous character , but is inferior in numbers
 the young men marry late , and their vigour is thus unimpaired
when these affairs were accomplished , caesar marched to the avaricum , which was the largest and best fortified town in the territories of the bituriges , and situated in a most fertile tract of country ; because he confidently expected that on taking that town , he would reduce beneath his dominion the state of the bituriges .
 here are these flooded plains which we know so well , here the marshes so fatal to the enemy
 but he barricaded with large beams fastened in the ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads without the walls , which led to the port . 
 report exaggerated them so that the war appeared to be almost at an end when these letters and dispatches were received at rome , a great concourse of people resorted to the house of afranius , and congratulations ran high ; several went out of italy to cneius pompey ; some of them , to be the first to bring him the intelligence ; others , that they might not be thought to have waited the issue of the war , and to have come last of all . 
 capito further added , the country in its eagerness for discord is now talking of you , nero , and of thrasea , as it talked once of caius caesar and marcus cato
 tiberius all the more studiously assumed an air of unconcern he changed neither his residence nor his look , but kept up his usual demeanour during the whole time , either from the profoundness of his reserve
 they were on the watch for something that might lead to an outbreak in the upper army , however , the 4th and 13th legions , which were stationed in the same winter-quarters , proceeded on this same first of january to break in pieces the images of galba , the 4th legion being foremost , the 18th shewing some reluctance , but soon joining with the rest
 then he led the emperor , furious and bursting out in menace , into the camp , where the soldiers were purposely assembled
 then descending into a cave and drinking a draught from a secret spring , the man , who is commonly ignorant of letters and of poetry , utters a response in verse answering to the thoughts conceived in the mind of any inquirer
from which a judgment might be formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as those whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed , they had afterward vanquished , when well armed and flushed with success .
 astonishment and indignation ran through the whole army , and they cursed this most horrible war
 when all things else , sacred and profane , were settling down into the flames , the temple of mephitis outside the walls alone remained standing , saved by its situation or by divine interposition
 rousing each other by this and like language , under the leadership of boudicea , a woman of kingly descent for they admit no distinction of sex in their royal successions , they all rose in arms
 his bowels too were relieved , and this seemed to have saved him
 hence a feud between vitellius and otho , ending in otho's banishment then albucilla , notorious for the number of her lovers , who had been married to satrius secundus , the betrayer of the late conspiracy , was charged with irreverence towards the emperor
 he then went back , and as he stood before the walls , now smiting his breast , now calling on individual soldiers by name , and luring them on by rewards , sought to excite a mutiny he had so far roused them that a standard bearer of the sixth legion went over to him with his standard
 being slighted , however , by that prince , he found no employment during the war
 fabius rusticus tells us that it was not agrippina , but nero , who lusted for the crime , and that it was frustrated by the adroitness of that same freed-girl
 aper himself thinks otherwise he merely followed an old practice much in vogue with your philosophical school of assuming the part of an opponent
 these things being prepared , he embarked on board small boats and row galleys by night , a considerable number of light infantry and archers , with all their fascines , and immediately after midnight , he marched sixty cohorts drafted from the greater camp and the outposts , to that part of our works which extended toward the sea , and were at the furthest distance from caesar's greater camp . 
 they even believe that the sex has a certain sanctity and prescience , and they do not despise their counsels , or make light of their answers
 he had himself been chosen to be the husband of the younger antonia , daughter of octavia , and subsequently led an army across the elbe , penetrating further into germany than any roman before him for this achievement he gained triumphal honours
 the weaker he assigned to cornelius flaccus , his lieutenant , and to insteius capito , his camp-prefect
but cotta , who had reflected that these things might occur on the march , and on that account had not been an adviser of the departure , was wanting to the common safety in no respect ; both in addressing and encouraging the soldiers , he performed the duties of a general , and in the battle those of a soldier .
 others crossed mount haemus , to stir up remote tribes
 on the revolt of the fleet becoming known , caecina called together to head-quarters , which he purposely selected as being the most retired part of the camp , the chief centurions and some few soldiers , while the rest were dispersed on various military duties
after arranging these matters , he levies ten thousand infantry on the aedui and segusiani , who border on our province : to these he adds eight hundred horse .
 in this new kind of war , new methods of managing it were invented by both generals . 
 maroboduus , now utterly deserted , had no resource but in the mercy of caesar
 their safety , he said , lay in their arms , which they must , however , use with discretion , and they must remain within the entrenchments , till the enemy approached closer , in the hope of storming them
 whatever the cause of the accident , it was thought of but little moment as long as more terrible disasters were apprehended
 strangers too and foreigners , having heard of him in their towns and colonies , as soon as they have arrived at rome , ask for him and are eager , as it were , to recognise him
 their stories and their prejudices from the very first fill the child's tender and uninstructed mind
 let the ancient character of these shows be retained , whenever the praetors exhibited them , and let no citizen be under the necessity of competing
 then the king or the chief , according to age , birth , distinction in war , or eloquence , is heard , more because he has influence to persuade than because he has power to command
in this manner , mixed with their own fugitives , such as the woods and mountains did not shelter were cut to pieces by our cavalry .
 but there are no tribes beyond us , nothing indeed but waves and rocks , and the yet more terrible romans , from whose oppression escape is vainly sought by obedience and submission
 as for montanus , a youth without a blemish , author of no libellous poem , he was positively driven out an exile because he had exhibited genius
 the accused was accordingly outlawed , with the further sentence that he was to be confined in an island from which neither macedonia nor thrace were conveniently accessible
 the king either suspecting a stratagem from these simultaneous movements in different directions , or intending to cut off our supplies as they were coming up from the sea of pontus and the town of trapezus , hastily withdrew
 and there were sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women
 afterward , changing his design for certain reasons , caesar removed his camp to a small distance beyond that place ; and after a few days , pompey took possession of it , and added more extensive works , leaving the inner rampart standing , as he intended to keep several legions there . 
 and the emperor , while he exalted his own glory , enhanced the renown of the vanquished
 the romans had everything ready for battle , the sarmatians were scattered , and in their eagerness for plunder had encumbered themselves with heavy baggage , while the superior speed of their horses was lost on the slippery roads
 an indefatigable soldier , he had by his zealous services won the consulship under the divine augustus , and subsequently the honours of a triumph for having stormed some fortresses of the homonadenses in cilicia
 that this freedman in crossing the straits met agricola , and without even saluting him made his way back to domitian though i cannot say whether the story is true , or is only a fiction invented to suit the emperor's character
 her panegyric was pronounced from the rostra by her great-grandson , caius caesar , who afterwards succeeded to power
 and now they had proceeded to further murders but for the opposition of afranius burrus and annaeus seneca
 and there still lingered the dread of the divine wrath nor was it without meaning , they thought , that , hostile to an impious host , the stars grew dim and storms burst over them
 by this means he gained this point , that he could be supplied without danger with corn , and auxiliaries ; for he sent to all the neighboring countries , to demand supplies . 
 the exhortations of the generals were not addressed as formal harangues to the assembled armies , but to the divisions separately , as they rode along the line
 as often as they turned their eyes back on the throng , they broke into savage exclamations , then looking up to drusus they trembled
 the voting and the judgment of the senate were devised to reach the lives and reputations of individuals
 he was himself for many years an exile , for four days a caesar , and galba's hurried adoption of him only gave him this privilege over his elder brother , that he perished first
 his comrades might stand by and look on , but that the most intense agony would not wring the truth from him
the motive for crossing was , that having been for several years harassed by the suevi , they were constantly engaged in war , and hindered from the pursuits of agriculture .
 above all , the conflagration of the capitol had made them believe that the end of the roman empire was at hand
at break of day they quit the camp , in a very extended line and with a very large amount of baggage , in such a manner as men who were convinced that the advice was given by ambiorix , not as an enemy , but as most friendly .
from all these things he judges with what danger and with what great courage matters had been conducted ; he commends cicero according to his desert , and likewise the legion ; he addresses individually the centurions and the tribunes of the soldiers , whose valor he had discovered to have been signal .
 for it appeared that the fort had been in a great measure saved by his exertions ; and he afterward very amply rewarded the cohorts with double pay , corn , clothing , and other military honors . 
 in pannonia , however , the 13th legion and the 7th galba's , which still retained their vexation and rage at the defeat of bedriacum , joined vespasian without hesitation , mainly under the influence of primus antonius
 i did not myself succeed to a throne without anxiety
he receives information of the death of sabinus and cotta from the prisoners .
 could vitellius have swayed the feelings of his partisans as easily as he had himself yielded , the army of vespasian might have entered the capital without bloodshed
 galba indeed was aware of the friendship between vinius and otho
 fabius valens had defamed him by secret charges of which he knew nothing , publicly praising him all the while , that he might the less suspect the treachery
 the angrivarii , who had lately been admitted to our alliance , restored to us several had ransomed from the inland tribes
 henceforth a respectful feeling towards the prince and a love of emulation proved more efficacious than legal penalties or terrors
 you , treveri , and other enslaved creatures , what reward do you expect for the blood which you have shed so often what but a hateful service , perpetual tribute , the rod , the axe , and the passions of a ruling race
 mucianus had no dislike to vespasian , and was strongly inclined towards titus
 we shall more readily endure his censure of details than we can now bear the silence by which he condemns everything
 i have heard that the total number of the besieged , of every age and both sexes , amounted to six hundred thousand
 meanwhile he conferred the praetorship on libo and often invited him to his table , showing no unfriendliness in his looks or anger in his words so thoroughly had he concealed his resentment
 discharges were offered without distinction
 that these things might be the more easily performed , and conditions secured and confirmed by oath , either let pompey come to caesar , or allow caesar to go to him ; it might be that all their disputes would be settled by an interview . 
 yet he endeavored to surround them with a wall and trench , that he might be able to check their most sudden sally , to which he imagined that they must have recourse . 
 this was the only style of adulation which yet remained
 the fields were full of rural wealth , the houses stood with open doors
 corbulo meantime transferred to syria the fourth and twelfth legions , which , from the loss of their bravest men and the panic of the remainder , seemed quite unfit for battle , and led thence into armenia the third and sixth legions , troops in thorough efficiency , and trained by frequent and successful service and he added to his army the fifth legion , which , having been quartered in pontus , had known nothing of disaster , with men of the fifteenth , lately brought up , and picked veterans from illyricum and egypt , and all the allied cavalry and infantry , and the auxiliaries of the tributary princes , which had been concentrated at melitene , where he was preparing to cross the euphrates
 but eloquence cannot be obtained for nothing
vercingetorix , having beheld his countrymen from the citadel of alesia , issues forth from the town ; he brings forth from the camp long hooks , movable pent-houses , mural hooks , and other things , which he had prepared for the purpose of making a sally .
when they had come to the camp , our men , after making a sally , slaying many of their men , and also capturing a distinguished leader named lugotorix , brought back their own men in safety .
 meanwhile the unconscious galba , busy with his sacrifice , was importuning the gods of an empire that was now another's a rumour reached him , that some senator unknown was being hurried into the camp before long it was affirmed that this senator was otho at the same time came messengers from all parts of the city , where they had chanced to meet the procession , some exaggerating the danger , some , who could not even then forget to flatter , representing it as less than the reality

 in italy the etrurians learnt them from demaratus of corinth , and the aborigines from the arcadian evander
 he had given directions that the fleet from the pontus should be brought up to byzantium , not having yet made up his mind , whether , avoiding moesia , he should move on dyrrachium with his infantry and cavalry , and at the same time blockade the sea on the side of italy with his ships of war , thus leaving asia and achaia safe in his rear , which , being bare of troops , would be left at the mercy of vitellius , unless they were occupied with proper garrisons and thus too vitellius himself , finding brundisium , tarentum , and the shores of calabria and lucania menaced by hostile fleets , would be in utter perplexity as to which part of italy he should protect
 neither the sight of the capitol , nor the sanctity of the overhanging temples , nor the thought of rulers past or future , could deter them from committing a crime , which any one succeeding to power must avenge
 he was then put in irons , and only released on the arrival of vocula , who the next day inflicted capital punishment on the ringleaders of the mutiny
 livia availed herself of the cunning of accusers , among whom she had selected julius postumus , a man well suited to her purpose , as he had an intrigue with mutilia prisca , and was consequently in the confidence of augusta , over whose mind prisca had great influence she thus made her aged grandmother , whose nature it was to tremble for her power , irreconcilably hostile to her grandson's widow
 what antonius advised by his letters , hordeonius suggested by word of mouth
 the soldiers , however , rejected it as a false report and judging the senate to be hostile to otho , watched their language , and put an unfavourable construction on their looks and manner
 such is the way with flattery , when repeated the funeral with its procession of statues was singularly grand aeneas , the father of the julian house , all the alban kings , romulus , rome's founder , then the sabine nobility , attus clausus , and the busts of all the other claudii were displayed in a long train
 even of the freedmen , all who were of incorruptible fidelity were discarded on the following provocation
the helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the narrow defile and the territories of the sequani , and had arrived at the territories of the aedui , and were ravaging their lands .
caesar , inasmuch as he kept in remembrance that lucius cassius , the consul , had been slain , and his army routed and made to pass under the yoke by the helvetii , did not think that ought to be granted : nor was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition , if an opportunity of marching through the province were given them , would abstain from outrage and mischief .
 indeed there was as yet no one to be obliged by such services
 they had assembled at petovio , the winter-quarters of the 13th legion
 caninius rebilus , one of the first men in legal knowledge and vastness of wealth , escaped the miseries of an old age of broken health by letting the blood trickle from his veins , though men did not credit him with sufficient resolution for a self-inflicted death , because of his infamous effeminacy
 it was said that he had attempted the same practices during the reign of vitellius
 having made himself acquainted with the disposition of his soldiers , caesar set off with that legion to ariminum , and there met the tribunes , who had fled to him for protection ; he called his other legions from winter quarters ; and ordered them to follow him . 
 though but few , they withstood the vast number of the enemy , as long as they fought on equal terms ; but when the legions began to approach , having lost a few men , they retreated to the next mountains . 
after renewing the action , and repulsing the enemy , he marches in the direction in which he had sent labienus , drafts four cohorts from the nearest redoubt , and orders part of the cavalry to follow him , and part to make the circuit of the external fortifications and attack the enemy in the rear .
 caesar , not thinking it a proper time to call them to account , and willing to pardon many faults , on account of their valor , deferred the whole matter , and gave them a private rebuke , for having made a traffic of their troops , and advised them to expect every thing from his friendship , and by his past favors to measure their future hopes . 
 he would publish in the same list those who had been expelled and those who had been allowed to retire , that by this confounding together of the decision of the censors and the modesty of voluntary resignation the disgrace might be softened
 she was accordingly summoned before the senate , and there they stood facing one another before the consuls' tribunal , the aged parent , and opposite to him the daughter , in the twentieth year of her age , widowed and forlorn , her husband annius pollio having lately been driven into banishment , without so much as a glance at her father , whose peril she seemed to have aggravated
 the emperor himself dedicated the weapon in the temple of the capital , and inscribed on it , to jupiter the avenger this passed without notice at the moment , but after the war of julius vindex it was construed as an omen and presage of impending vengeance
these having been entrapped , the eburones , the nervii , and the aduatici and all their allies and dependents , begin to attack the legion : our men quickly run together to arms and mount the rampart ; they sustained the attack that day with great difficulty , since the enemy placed all their hope in dispatch , and felt assured that , if they obtained this victory , they would be conquerors forever .
 as he preserved them with the greatest care , there was not a state in thessaly except larissa , which was awed by a strong army of scipio's , but on comparing the fate of the inhabitants of metropolis with the severe treatment of gomphi , gave admission to caesar , and obeyed his orders . 
 consequently it was considered a question how far the emperor would be allowed to go against her
 for what am i first to begin with restraining and cutting down to the old standard
 all the oldest among them began to inveigh against their own credulity , and to point out the difficulty and danger of their position , if on those open plains caecina and his army were to surround their scanty forces
but then , the barbarians being alarmed , because they had heard that a town fortified by the nature of the place and by art , had been taken by us in a few days after our arrival there , began to send embassadors into all quarters , to combine , to give hostages one to another , to raise troops .
 when envoys from armenia were pleading their nation's cause before nero , she actually was on the point of mounting the emperor's tribunal and of presiding with him but seneca , when every one else was paralysed with alarm , motioned to the prince to go and meet his mother
 the valley was so difficult of assent that the foremost men could not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind . 
there were these difficulties which we have mentioned above , in carrying on the war , but many things , nevertheless , urged caesar to that war ; —the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the roman knights , the rebellion raised after surrendering , the revolt after hostages were given , the confederacy of so many states , but principally , lest if , this part was overlooked , the other nations should think that the same thing was permitted them .
 two men of noble rank died in that year , cneius lentulus and lucius domitius
 it happened at this time that the emperor after inspecting the apparel in which wives and mothers of the imperial house had been seen to glitter , selected a jewelled robe and sent it as a gift to his mother , with the unsparing liberality of one who was bestowing by preference on her a choice and much coveted present
when caesar inquired of them what states were in arms , how powerful they were , and what they could do , in war , he received the following information : that the greater part of the belgae were sprung from the germans , and that having crossed the rhine at an early period , they had settled there , on account of the fertility of the country , and had driven out the gauls who inhabited those regions ; and that they were the only people who , in the memory of our fathers , when all gaul was overrun , had prevented the teutones and the cimbri from entering their territories ; the effect of which was , that , from the recollection of those events , they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness in military matters .
 he returned , pretending to have failed in his mission , but not revealing the other facts
after summoning the chiefs of gaul , caesar thought proper to pretend ignorance of the things which he had discovered ; and having conciliated and confirmed their minds , and ordered some cavalry to be raised , resolved to make war against the germans .
 cneius piso meanwhile , that he might the sooner enter on his design , terrified the citizens of athens by his tumultuous approach , and then reviled them in a bitter speech , with indirect reflections on germanicus , who , he said , had derogated from the honour of the roman name in having treated with excessive courtesy , not the people of athens , who indeed had been exterminated by repeated disasters , but a miserable medley of tribes

 when we had possessed ourselves of achaia and asia , games were exhibited with greater elaboration , and yet no one at rome of good family had stooped to the theatrical profession during the 200 years following the triumph of lucius mummius , who first displayed this kind of show in the capital
 that general , with a view to the prestige which in a new enterprise is supremely powerful , speedily accomplished his march , and at aegeae , a city of cilicia , met quadratus who had advanced to the place under an apprehension that , should corbulo once enter armenia to take command of the army , he would draw all eyes on himself , by his noble stature , his imposing eloquence , and the impression he would make , not only by his wisdom and experience , but also by the mere display of showy attributes
 his confidential freedmen and slaves , who enjoyed a license unknown in private families , brought the debaucheries of nero's court , its intrigues , its easy marriages , and the other indulgences of despotic power , before a mind passionately fond of such things , dwelt upon them as his if he dared to seize them , and reproached the inaction that would leave them to others the astrologers also urged him to action , predicting from their observation of the heavens revolutions , and a year of glory for otho this is a class of men , whom the powerful cannot trust , and who deceive the aspiring , a class which will always be proscribed in this country , and yet always retained
 nor was it only the praetorians , who were peculiarly otho's troops , that thus acted those who had been sent on from moesia declared that the approaching army was as firmly resolved , and that the legions had entered aquileia no one therefore can doubt that the war might have been renewed with its terrible disasters , and its uncertainties both for victors and vanquished
 the forts are ungarrisoned the colonies in the hands of aged men
 to all the armies and legates letters were despatched , and instructions were given to them that they were to attach the praetorians , who hated vitellius , by the inducement of renewed military service
on obtaining this authority , he demands hostages from all these states , he orders a fixed number of soldiers to be sent to him immediately ; he determines what quantity of arms each state shall prepare at home , and before what time ; he pays particular attention to the cavalry .
but the germans , according to their custom , rapidly forming a phalanx , sustained the attack of our swords .
 the truth is , that when one craves something not yet forbidden , there is a fear that it may be forbidden
 he put faith in this intelligence , and , besides , several watchfires were seen scouts also , who had crept close up to the enemy , reported that they had heard the neighing of horses and the hum of a huge and tumultuous host
 the danger and the peril we shall share alike nay , i would rather have you , as is the better policy , direct your armies , and leave to me the conduct of the war and the hazards of battle
 during this debate severus caecina proposed that no magistrate who had obtained a province should be accompanied by his wife he began by recounting at length how harmoniously he had lived with his wife , who had borne him six children , and how in his own home he had observed what he was proposing for the public , by having kept her in italy , though he had himself served forty campaigns in various provinces
 when this work was finished , caesar's scouts observed that some cohorts , which to them appeared like a legion , were retired behind the wood , and were on their march to the old camp . 
 everything seemed in favour of the enemy , till the 21st legion , having more room than the others , formed itself into a compact body , withstood , and soon drove back the assailants
 they are less able to bear laborious work
 i will therefore both explain the grounds of my previous silence and my intentions for the future
an assembly being held the following day , he states the occurrence ; he consoles and encourages the soldiers ; he suggests , that the disaster , which had been occasioned by the misconduct and rashness of his lieutenant , should be borne with a patient mind , because by the favor of the immortal gods and their own valor , neither was lasting joy left to the enemy , nor very lasting grief to them .
 and now the albanians and iberians seized , and hurled the parthians from their steeds , and embarrassed their enemy with a double attack , pressed as they were by the cavalry on the heights and by the nearer blows of the infantry
 they are wont to bury rather than to burn their dead , following in this the egyptian custom
 it happened at the time that the emperor was on his way campania and that petronius , after going as far as cumae , was there detained
 they entreated , stopped the way , that agrippina might return and remain , some running to meet her , while most of them went back to germanicus
 then they began to back water , and to run the sterns on to the hostile shore
 never before , he said , had a native of rome , no hostage but a citizen , gone to mount a foreign throne at first his arrival was welcome to the germans , and they crowded to pay him court , for he was untainted by any spirit of faction , and showed the same hearty goodwill to all , practising sometimes the courtesy and temperance which can never offend , but oftener those excesses of wine and lust in which barbarians delight he was winning fame among his neighbours and even far beyond them , when some who had found their fortune in party feuds , jealous of his power , fled to the tribes on the border , protesting that germany was being robbed of her ancient freedom , and that the might of rome was on the rise
 creditors however were suing for payment in full , and it was not respectable for persons when sued to break faith
 his uncle , not even to the city gates where were all those usages of the past , the image at the head of the bier , the lays composed in commemoration of worth , the eulogies and laments , or at least the semblance of grief
 however , that a conspiracy was begun , matured , and conclusively proved was not doubted at the time by those who took pains to ascertain the truth , and is admitted by those who after nero's death returned to the capital
 but , it will be said , we have fought with the senones
 the baggage of the legions was therefore sent to novesium with a crowd of non-combatants to fetch corn from that place overland , for the enemy commanded the river
 he was of a royal house , of a race distinguished both in peace and war , and he himself claimed to be by family tradition the foe rather than the ally of the romans
after the battle about 130 , 000 men remained alive , who marched incessantly during the whole of that night ; and after a march discontinued for no part of the night , arrived in the territories of the lingones on the fourth day , while our men , having stopped for three days , both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of the slain , had not been able to follow them .
 but the mob was attracted by the magnificence of his bounties the most foolish bought these favours with money the wise held that to be invalid , which could neither be given nor received without ruin to the state
 this worship , however introduced , is upheld by its antiquity
 births of monsters , half man , half beast , and of a pig with a hawk's talons , were reported
 they , however , could hardly be dragged out of their tents , and would merely defend their lives , some held back by the general's order , others by their own cowardice they seemed to be awaiting corbulo , and should they be overpowered by force , they had before them the examples of candium and numantia
 caesar , having disposed parties on the mountains , and cut off all access to the ebro , fortified his camp as close to the enemy as he could . 
 vespasian had all but completed the jewish war , and only the siege of jerusalem now remained , an operation , the difficulty and arduousness of which was due , rather to the character of its mountain citadel and the perverse obstinacy of the national superstition , than to any sufficient means of enduring extremities left to the besieged
 lucius piso , the censor , offered to go to caesar : as did likewise lucius roscius , the praetor , to inform him of these affairs , and require only six days' time to finish the business . 
it was a great hinderance to the gauls in fighting , that , when several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the javelins pierced through and pinned fast together , as the point of the iron had bent itself , they could neither pluck it out , nor , with their left hand entangled , fight with sufficient ease ; so that many , after having long tossed their arm about , chose rather to cast away the buckler from their hand , and to fight with their person unprotected .
and having gone to another quarter for the purpose of encouraging , he finds them fighting .
 tiberius , to show his impartiality , received the youth courteously , and enriched him with the liberality he usually bestowed on the sons of noble families
 i will now fully describe his extraction , his character , and the daring wickedness by which he grasped at power
being repulsed by our cavalry , they concealed themselves in woods , as they had secured a place admirably fortified by nature and by art , which , as it seemed , they had before prepared on account of a civil war ; for all entrances to it were shut up by a great number of felled trees .
 at the same time he observed the roads very full of carriages and cattle , which they were conveying from the country into the town on the sudden alarm . 
 but they had life's prime for their stay they had seen some happiness , and the horror of the moment was alleviated by recollections of a better lot in the past
 he admitted into the secret of his imposture all the most worthless of his followers and the credulous populace and some of the soldiers , either from not knowing the truth , or impatient for revolution , began eagerly to rally round him when he was brought before vitellius , and asked who he was , as his account of himself could not be trusted , , and his master recognised him as a runaway slave , by name geta , he was executed as slaves usually are
 germany is separated from the galli , the rhæti , and pannonii , by the rivers rhine and danube mountain ranges , or the fear which each feels for the other , divide it from the sarmatæ and daci
when eporedirix and viridomarus came to this place , and received information of the disposition of the state , that litavicus had been admitted by the aedui into bibracte , which is a town of the greatest importance among them , that convictolitanis the chief magistrate and a great part of the senate had gone to meet him , that embassadors had been publicly sent to vercingetorix to negotiate a peace and alliance ; they thought that so great an opportunity ought not to be neglected .
while these things are going on at gergovia , the aedui , on receiving the first announcements from litavicus , leave themselves no time to ascertain the truth of those statements .
 in her extremity , it was her pride alone which forsook her
 soon afterwards , corbulo's envoys whom he had sent to tigranocerta , reported that the city walls were open , and the inhabitants awaiting orders
 men of the legions rapax and italica were mingled with all the companies
 to pacify the feelings of domitian , which were not unfavourable to varus , he appointed arretinus clemens , who was closely connected with the house of vespasian , and who was also a great favourite with domitian , to the command of the praetorian guard , alleging that his father , in the reign of caligula , had admirably discharged the duties of that office the old name he said , would please the soldiers , and clemens himself , though on the roll of senators , would be equal to both duties
with these instructions he dismissed him from his presence .
 they encouraged one another not to begin the battle with volleys of arrows
by their arrival , so great a change of matters was made , that our men , even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds , leaned on their shields , and renewed the fight : then the camp-retainers , though unarmed , seeing the enemy completely dismayed , attacked armed ; the horsemen too , that they might by their valor blot the disgrace of their flight , thrust themselves before the legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle .
 behind them there is nothing to dread
 they started for a campaign rather than for a battle , making for the confluence of the padus and addua , a distance of sixteen miles from their position
 flavius sabinus hesitating to act in a matter of such importance , triaria , the wife of lucius vitellius , with unfeminine ferocity , warned him not to seek a reputation for clemency by imperilling the emperor
 he wrote , however , a letter to the senate , confessing nothing about the murders of sulla and plautus , but merely hinting that both had a restless temper , and that he gave the most anxious thought to the safety of the state
 in the midst of this panic antonius omitted nothing that a self-possessed commander or a most intrepid soldier could do
 and proposals were also made that mount caelius should for the future be called mount augustus , inasmuch as when all around was in flames only a single statue of tiberius in the house of one junius , a senator , had remained uninjured
they esteem it their greatest praise as a nation , that the lands about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent , inasmuch as that by this circumstance is indicated , that a great number of nations can not withstand their power ; and thus on one side of the suevi the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred miles .
 he was rushing , as he spoke , into the embraces of his daughter who hurried towards him , but the lictors interposed and stopped them both
 the rest found shelter behind the fortifications
having collected such a body of troops , he brings over to his sentiments such of his fellow-citizens as he has access to : he exhorts them to take up arms in behalf of the general freedom , and having assembled great forces he drives from the state his opponents , by whom he had been expelled a short time previously .
he fearing , because several were involved in the act , that the state might revolt at their instigation , orders lucius plancus , with a legion , to proceed quickly from belgium to the carnutes , and winter there , and arrest and send to him the persons by whose instrumentality he should discover that tasgetius was slain .
 on his arrival there , he was informed that vibullius rufus , whom he had taken a few days before at corfinium , and set at liberty , was sent by pompey into spain ; and that domitius also was gone to seize massilia with seven row-galleys , which were fitted up by some private persons at igilium and cosa , and which he had manned with his own slaves , freedmen , and colonists : and that some young noble men of massilia had been sent before him ; whom pompey , when leaving rome had exhorted , that the late services of caesar should not erase from their minds the memory of his former favors . 
they thought , that considering the extent of their population , and their renown for warfare and bravery , they had but narrow limits , although they extended in length 240 , and in breadth 180 miles .
 it so happened that galba's legion had had their work allotted to them on that side the lines which faced the enemy , and that some of the allied cavalry appearing in the distance were taken for the enemy , and excited a groundless panic
his soldiers hurling their javelins from the higher ground , easily broke the enemy's phalanx .
 of the former period , the 820 years dating from the founding of the city , many authors have treated and while they had to record the transactions of the roman people , they wrote with equal eloquence and freedom
 for these reasons every thing was done in a hasty and disorderly manner , and neither was time given to caesar's relations to inform him of the state of affairs nor liberty to the tribunes of the people to deprecate their own danger , nor even to retain the last privilege , which sylla had left them , the interposing their authority ; but on the seventh day they were obliged to think of their own safety , which the most turbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to , nor to fear being called to an account for their actions , till the eighth month . 
 first , the keels and ribs were made of light timber , then , the rest of the hulk of the ships was wrought with wicker work , and covered over with hides . 
 he had himself been in the habit of opposing thrasea
 she besought vibidia , the eldest of the vestal virgins , to demand audience of the supreme pontiff and to beg for mercy
 the truth is he succeeded more by vehemence than by finish of style while the research and labours of other authors are valued by an after age , the harmonious fluency of haterius died with him
 the common people and this busy population continually inquired at his house , and talked of him in public places and in private gatherings
caesar , after sending messengers to the state of the aedui , to inform them that they whom he could have put to death by the right of war were spared through his kindness , and after giving three hours of the night to his army for his repose , directed his march to gergovia .
 should they destroy it , they will attack freedom itself
yet , in order that a period might intervene , until the soldiers whom he had ordered should assemble , he replied to the ambassadors , that he would take time to deliberate ; if they wanted any thing , they might return on the day before the ides of april .
 all the most obstinate rebels had escaped into the place , and perpetual seditions were the consequence
 i have already described how the batavian cohorts who separated from the 14th legion during the neronian war , hearing on their way to britain of the rising of vitellius , joined fabius valens in the country of the lingones they behaved themselves insolently , boasting , as they visited the quarters of the several legions , that they had mastered the men of the 14th , that they had taken italy from nero , that the whole destiny of the war lay in their hands
he sprung from the noblest family among the arverni , and possessing great influence , says , i shall pay no attention to the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender by the name of a capitulation ; nor do i think that they ought to be considered as citizens , or summoned to the council .
 still the career of blaesus merited such a reward for tacfarinas , though often driven back , had recruited his resources in the interior of africa , and had become so insolent as to send envoys to tiberius , actually demanding a settlement for himself and his army , or else threatening us with an interminable war
 when men's minds were no longer occupied by their fears , the fact , that while otho was preparing for his campaign , the campus martius and the via flaminia , his route to the war , were obstructed by causes either fortuitous or natural , was regarded as a prodigy and an omen of impending disasters
 such , as far as one can speak of so vast a multitude , was the state of feeling at rome
 he thought there must be a meaning in the frequent messages and the consultations , and he learnt at the same time that an annual payment was furnished him by publius anteius
 their strength equalized the conflict , which after a while was in our favour
the gauls within , despairing of forcing the fortifications in the plains on account of the greatness of the works , attempt the places precipitous in ascent : hither they bring the engines which they had prepared ; by the immense number of their missiles they dislodge the defenders from the turrets : they fill the ditches with clay and hurdles , then clear the way ; they tear down the rampart and breast-work with hooks .
when those in the nearest vessels saw them , they speedily followed and approached the enemy .
 but , as my actual condition required , you watched over my boyhood , then over my youth , with wisdom , counsel , and advice
 he sought a character for moderation after he had glutted his pride
 the closer and fiercer of the two threatened the asylum
 when his approach was announced , lucius plancus , who had the command of those legions , compelled by the emergency , took post on a rising ground ; and drew up his army with two fronts , that it might not be surrounded by the cavalry . 
 he was charged with having designed the assassination of vitellius
 this delusion restored the courage of the romans , and in relying on the strength of others they recovered their own
it seemed most proper to send to him gaius valerius procillus , the son of gaius valerius caburus , a young man of the highest courage and accomplishments , both on account of his fidelity and on account of his knowledge of the gallic language , which ariovistus , by long practice , now spoke fluently ; and because in his case the germans would have no motive for committing violence ; and marcus mettius , who had shared the hospitality of ariovistus .
 when he had won these distinctions , he began to believe that it portended the imperial power
on the seventh day of the attack , a very high wind having risen up , they began to throw by their slings hot bullets made of softened clay , and heated javelins , upon the huts , which , after the gallic custom , were thatched with straw .
 you often command our legions
 the dependants fight
 it was said by men who knew the stars that the motions of the heavenly bodies when tiberius left rome were such as to forbid the possibility of his return
 there can never be complete confidence in a power which is excessive
 they had now grown used to threaten
 most of the senators signified their assent by their looks , or by raising the hand but a few , who either held a distinguished rank , or had a practised talent for flattery , declared their acquiescence in studied speeches
 the result was a jealousy between the two generals
 for , after all , what a mere handful of soldiers has crossed over , if we britons look at our own numbers
 caesar , although called back to italy by many and important matters , yet had determined to leave no dregs of war behind him in spain , because he knew that pompey had many dependents and clients in the hither province . 
 meanwhile corbulo occupied the bank of the euphrates , which he had never neglected , with troops at closer intervals
 the conflict took place not far from the city among buildings , gardens , and winding lanes , which were well known to the vitellianists , but disconcerting to their opponents , to whom they were strange
 in this codicil he is also said to have written , by way of remonstrance against the injustice of his death , that he died without any cause for punishment , while rufius crispinus and anicius cerialis still enjoyed life , though bitter foes to the prince
 when however vespasian had restored to unity britain as well as the rest of the world , in the presence of great generals and renowned armies the enemy's hopes were crushed
 there were also many detachments from germany , britain , and illyria , selected by nero , and sent on by him to the caspian passes , for service in the expedition which he was preparing against the albani , but afterwards recalled to crush the insurrection of vindex
for neither does any one except merchants generally go thither , nor even to them was any portion of it known , except the sea-coast and those parts which are opposite to gaul .
 he was even heard to say at a banquet given by the king of the nabataeans , when some golden crowns of great weight were presented to caesar and agrippina and light ones to piso and the rest , that the entertainment was given to the son of a roman emperor , not of a parthian king
 if they shouted out that he was guilty , he was thrown headlong and cut to pieces
 granted that he concealed his purpose , that he procured his weapon without his fellows' knowledge
 and shortly after , caesar having got notice by the smoke of all the forts , which was the usual signal on such occasions , drafted off some cohorts from the outposts , and went to the scene of action . 
 besides , many new imposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice . 
 thus all elements of disturbance being removed , the usual appearance of the capital , the laws , and the jurisdiction of the magistrates , were once more restored
 the defence of the bank of the rhine was entrusted to hordeonius flaccus
 the emperor had despatched two praetorian cohorts with instructions that the magistrates of calabria , apulia , and campania were to pay the last honours to his son's memory
 and so cneius piso asked , in what order will you vote , caesar
 i implore you to cherish my memory with joy rather than with sorrow , numbering me too with those who by noble death have fled from the miseries of our country
 macer was executed in africa , where he was undoubtedly fomenting sedition , by trebonius garutianus the procurator , who acted on galba's authority capito fell in germany , while he was making similar attempts , by the hands of cornelius aquinus and fabius valens , legates of legions , who did not wait for an order
when they were brought , among them his son and near relations , whom he had demanded by name , he consoled indutiomarus , and enjoined him to continue in his allegiance ; yet , nevertheless , summoning to him the chief men of the treveri , he reconciled them individually to cingetorix : this he both thought should be done by him in justice to the merits of the latter , and also judged that it was of great importance that the influence of one whose singular attachment toward him he had fully seen , should prevail as much as possible among his people .
 while vespasian and the generals of his party were thus occupied in the provinces , vitellius was daily becoming more contemptible and indolent , halting to enjoy the pleasures of every town and villa in his way , as with his cumbrous host he advanced towards the capital
 hence a passion for propagating their race and a contempt for death
 as they were persons nobly descended and of liberal education , and had come with a great retinue , and several cattle , and were reckoned men of courage , and had been in great esteem with caesar , and as it was a new and uncommon event , pompey carried them round all his works , and made an ostentatious show of them , for till that day , not a soldier , either horse or foot had deserted from caesar to pompey , though there were desertions almost every day from pompey to caesar : but more commonly among the soldiers levied in epirus and aetolia , and in those countries , which were in caesar's possession . 
 then followed twenty years of continuous strife
 after a while , late at night , his wife having left his chamber , he ordered the doors to be closed , and at daybreak was found with his throat cut and a sword lying on the ground
animated by this opportunity , they who already , previously to this occurrence , were indignant that they were reduced beneath the dominion of rome , begin to organize their plans for war more openly and daringly .
 he charges him to exhort libo to effect a peace , but , above all things , requires that he should be admitted to an interview with pompey . 
 when he had done with his mimicries of sorrow he entered the senate , and having first referred to the authority of the senators and the concurrence of the soldiery , he then dwelt on the counsels and examples which he had to guide him in the right administration of empire his boyhood , he said , had not had the taint of civil wars or domestic feuds , and he brought with him no hatreds , no sense of wrong , no desire of vengeance
 it lies between two most mighty empires , and is very often at strife with them , hating rome and jealous of parthia
on the seventh day , as he did not discontinue his march , he was informed by scouts that the forces of ariovistus were only four and twenty miles distant from ours .
 when these were almost finished , afranius and petreius began to be greatly alarmed , lest they should be altogether cut off from corn and forage , because caesar was very strong in cavalry . 
accordingly , drawing out their troops , they encamp before the town , and cover the nearest trench with hurdles and fill it up with earth , and make ready for a sally and every casualty .
 rome was in her 640th year when we first heard of the cimbrian invader in the consulship of cæcilius metellus and papirius carbo , from which time to the second consulship of the emperor trajan we have to reckon about 210 years
 for during the very same period torquatus silanus was forced to die , because over and above his illustrious rank as one of the junian family he claimed to be the great-grandson of augustus
they surround and kill the man as they had been commanded ; but the aeduan horsemen all return to caesar .
 we , though so often provoked , have used the right of conquest to burden you only with the cost of maintaining peace
 cicero again was slightingly spoken of by calvus as loose and nerveless , and by brutus , to use his own words , as languid and effeminate
 while this treaty was going forward , domitius arrived at massilia with his fleet , and was received into the city , and made governor of it . 
 the number and valour of his followers , for such a man is courted by embassies , is honoured with presents , and the very prestige of his name often settles a war
 the generals of pompey's army did almost the same thing , and for the same reason : and the horse had frequent skirmishes with each other . 
 the first he met of the defeated army was paccius , a first-rank centurion , then many of the soldiers , whom , when they pleaded various excuses for flight , he advised to return to their standards and throw themselves on the mercy of paetus
 shall one or two worthless and drunken fellows , for i cannot believe that more were carried away by the frenzy of the late outbreak , imbrue their hands in the blood of centurions and tribunes , and burst into the tent of their emperor
 at once , inflated with pride and haughtiness , they demanded , by way of remuneration for their march , a donative , double pay , and an increase in the number of cavalry , things indeed which vitellius had promised , but which they now asked , not with the thought of obtaining them , but as a pretext for mutiny
 he was himself at the head of an equal number of legions and twice as many allies having established a fort on the site of his father's entrenchments on mount taunus he hurried his troops in quick marching order against the chatti , leaving lucius apronius to direct works connected with roads and bridges

 the legions had their respective duties assigned to them , and there was a cessation from fighting , till all the inventions , used in ancient warfare , or devised by modern ingenuity for the reduction of cities , were constructed

 as to the woods and groves and that retirement which aper denounced , they bring such delight to me that i count among the chief enjoyments of poetry the fact that it is composed not in the midst of bustle , or with a suitor sitting before one's door , or amid the wretchedness and tears of prisoners , but that the soul withdraws herself to abodes of purity and innocence , and enjoys her holy resting-place

 all other things princes have as a matter of course
for leaving a guard opposite to the camp and sending a small body in the direction of metiosedum , with orders to advance as far as the ships would proceed , they led the rest of their troops against labienus .

 soon , as the emperor's love grew ardent , she would change and be supercilious , and , if she were detained more than one or two nights , would say again and again that she was a married woman and could not give up her husband attached as she was to otho by a manner of life , which no one equalled
 so that it did not appear safe either to keep their ground and maintain their ranks , or to issue from the line , and run the risk . 
 in a state of moderate dimensions equality was easily preserved
many soldiers of the legions had been left invalided in the camp , of whom those who had recovered in this space of time , being about 300 , are sent together under one standard ; a large number of soldiers' attendants besides , with a great number of beasts of burden , which had remained in the camp , permission being granted , follow them .

 we who , a moment before , were alarmed for ourselves , were safely lodged in a very secure harbor : and they who had threatened ruin to our fleet , were forced to be uneasy on their own account : and thus , by a change of circumstances , the storm protected our ships , and damaged the rhodian fleet to such a degree that all their decked ships , sixteen in number , foundered , without exception , and were wrecked : and of the prodigious number of seamen and soldiers , some lost their lives by being dashed against the rocks , others were taken by our men : but caesar sent them all safe home . 
 in a word , utterly careless of the future , he mutilated the resources of the empire

 the ninth cried again and again that they ought to wait for the letter from tiberius , but soon finding themselves isolated by the departure of the rest , they voluntarily forestalled their inevitable fate
he himself , having drawn up his army in three lines , advanced to the camp of the enemy then at last of necessity the germans drew their forces out of camp , and disposed them canton by canton , at equal distances , the harudes , marcomanni , tribocci , vangiones , nemetes , sedusii , suevi ; and surrounded their whole army with their chariots and wagons , that no hope might be left in flight .
 rubrius gallus was charged with the petition of the cohorts which had been quartered at brixellum an amnesty was immediately granted to them , while at the same time the forces which had been commanded by flavius sabinus signified through him their submission to the conqueror

 at first , afranius's soldiers ran in high spirits from their camp to look at us , and in contumelious language upbraided us , that we were forced , for want of necessary subsistence , to run away , and return to ilerda . 
 to answer this question of yours , to undertake the burden of so serious an inquiry , involving , as it must , a mean opinion either of our capacities , if we cannot reach the same standard , or of our tastes , if we have not the wish , is a task on which i should scarcely venture had i to give my own views instead of being able to reproduce a conversation among men , for our time , singularly eloquent , whom , when quite a youth , i heard discussing this very question
while this town had on all sides around it very high rocks and precipices , there was left on one side a gently ascending approach , of not more than 200 feet in width ; which place they had fortified with a very lofty double wall : besides , they had placed stones of great weight and sharpened stakes upon the walls .
 everything was in an uproar with their tumultuous cries and their appeals to each other , which were not , like those of a popular assembly or a mob , the discordant expressions of an idle flattery on the contrary , as soon as they caught sight of any of the soldiers who were flocking in , they seized him , gave him the military embrace , placed him close to otho , dictated to him the oath of allegiance , commending sometimes the emperor to his soldiers , sometimes the soldiers to their emperor otho did not fail to play his part he stretched out his arms , and bowed to the crowd , and kissed his hands , and altogether acted the slave , to make himself the master

 it is related by several writers of the period that many days before the murder , nero had offered the worst insult to the boyhood of britannicus so that his death could no longer seem a premature or dreadful event , though it happened at the sacred board , without even a moment for the embraces of his sisters , hurried on too , as it was , under the eyes of an enemy , on the sole surviving offspring of the claudii , the victim first of dishonour , then of poison
 he seemed like one who had the power rather than the wish to rule it was next discussed whether the adoption should be publicly pronounced in front of the rostra , in the senate , or in the camp

 marcus aletus , one of the expraetors , was chosen , from a fear that , as an exconsul was governor of asia , there might be rivalry between men of equal rank , and consequent embarrassment
 these mysterious prophecies had pointed to vespasian and titus , but the common people , with the usual blindness of ambition , had interpreted these mighty destinies of themselves , and could not be brought even by disasters to believe the truth

sextius faints , after receiving many wounds ; he is with difficulty saved , drawn away by the hands of the soldiers .
 whether this man in their frequent interviews tempted piso to revolt , or whether he resisted such overtures , is not known for certain , for no one was present at their confidential meetings , and , after piso's death , many were disposed to ingratiate themselves with the murderer
 certainly , it was a new thing for the emperor to refer to the senate merely what concerned the soldier's interests

 they , whether they uttered the sentiments which they really entertained , or wished to gratify varus for what we wish we readily give credit to , and what we think ourselves , we hope is the opinion of other men , assured him , that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to curio , that it was very expedient that the armies should be brought in view of each other , and an opportunity of a conference be given . 
 such tactics were familiar to these veteran soldiers , but were embarrassing to an enemy armed with small bucklers and unwieldy weapons
 thrasea has his followers or rather his satellites , who copy , not indeed as yet the audacious tone of his sentiments , but only his manners and his looks , a sour and gloomy set , bent on making your mirthfulness a reproach to you
the charioteers in the mean time withdraw some little distance from the battle , and so place themselves with the chariots that , if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy , they may have a ready retreat to their own troops .
 from his acquaintance with the people and country , and his knowledge of that province , he found the means of effecting this ; because a few years before , at the expiration of his praetorship , he had obtained that province . 
 but germanicus also bestowed attention on other wonders chief of these were the stone image of memnon , which , when struck by the sun's rays , gives out the sound of a human voice the pyramids , rising up like mountains amid almost impassable wastes of shifting sand , raised by the emulation and vast wealth of kings the lake hollowed out of the earth to be a receptacle for the nile's overflow
 after a few days , he placed a party of horse in ambush in the night , where our men had usually gone to forage for several days before . 
 even the defence of traulus montanus , a roman knight , was not admitted
 rome felt for him a deep and lasting regret , because of the remembrance of his worth , because too of the merely passive virtue of one of his successors and the very flagrant iniquities of the other
 taking therefore measures suited to their exigency , and to the shortness of the time , pompey possessed himself of an eminence , at such a distance from our fort that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach him . 
when the towers had now approached the walls , caesar ascertained from the captives that vercingetorix after destroying the forage , had pitched his camp nearer avaricum , and that he himself with the cavalry and light-armed infantry , who generally fought among the horse , had gone to lay an ambuscade in that quarter , to which he thought that our troops would come the next day to forage .
 some praetorians , whom otho had attached to the embassy , ostensibly as a mark of distinction , were sent back before they could mix with the legions
 these and like arguments failed to impress the emperor
 there are many preliminaries to guilt
 some extracts from the speeches of rufus he represented as insulting to vitellius , and intended to win popularity for himself
 to part was a level approach by this encampment augustus had thought the german tribes might be watched and checked

he summons dumnorix to him ; he brings in his brother ; he points out what he censures in him ; he lays before him what he of himself perceives , and what the state complains of ; he warns him for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion ; he says that he pardons the past , for the sake of his brother , diviciacus .
two rivers , on two different sides , washed the foot of the hill before the town lay a plain of about three miles in length ; on every other side hills at a moderate distance , and of an equal degree of height , surrounded the town .
 this retribution , as great as it was just , had divided the senate into two parties
 he sent foraging parties over these bridges , because he had already consumed all the forage that was on his side of the river . 
labienus confined his men within the fortifications , and promoted the enemy's belief of his fear by whatever methods he could .

 their feelings underwent a sudden change
 in the first encounter about seventy of our men fell : among them quintus fulgenius , first centurion of the second line of the fourteenth legion , who , for his extraordinary valor , had been promoted from the lower ranks to that post . 
 hitherto he had sung in private houses or gardens , during the juvenile games , but these he now despised , as being but little frequented , and on too small a scale for so fine a voice
 he then addressed a letter to piso , renouncing his friendship , and , as many also state , ordered him to quit the province
 for men according as they pitied germanicus and were prepossessed with suspicion or were biased by partiality towards piso , gave conflicting accounts
 as it is , look back upon your former honours , question your own eyes
 about vitellius all was disorder and drunkenness , more like a nocturnal feast and revel than a properly disciplined camp
 then all the rest hurried up , called him caesar and augustus , and heaped on him all the titles of imperial rank
 money too was distributed , which the respectable had to spend under sheer compulsion and which the profligate gloried in squandering
 frenzied with fear and guilt , they sought to plunge everything into confusion , resorting , now to openly seditious language , now to secret letters to otho
 this is the style which the lecture-room chiefly praises , and which next becomes the world's talk
they report in addition also , about the death of sabinus .
 caius sosius reduced the jews to subjection
 we have examples at hand how great were the fees for which publius clodius and caius curio were wont to speak ! we are ordinary senators , seeking in the tranquillity of the state for none but peaceful gains
 freedom and the consulship were established by lucius brutus
 the vanquished troops , following what had become a regular practice , laid the blame not on their own cowardice , but on supposed treachery in the legate
 that these wars were terminated by what we may call single blows , was owing to want of energy in the chiefs
 some , it is said , hesitated , and looked round and asked where britannicus was
 and so , when the conspirators were assured by his own repeated language that the commander of the praetorian guard had come over to their side , they once more eagerly discussed the time and place of the fatal deed
 it is to be restricted within proper limits
when the battle was going on in every direction , the rest of the night being now spent , and fresh hopes of victory always arose before the enemy : the more so on this account because they saw the coverings of our towers burnt away , and perceived , that we , being exposed , could not easily go to give assistance , and they themselves were always relieving the weary with fresh men , and considered that all the safety of gaul rested on this crisis ; there happened in my own view a circumstance which , having appeared to be worthy of record , we thought it ought not to be omitted .
 all we get by patience , they said , is that heavier demands are exacted from us , as from men who will readily submit
 thus six engagements having happened in one day , three at dyrrachium , and three at the fortifications , when a computation was made of the number of slain , we found that about two thousand fell on pompey's side , several of them volunteer veterans and centurions . 
 he effected this with such celerity , that news of his march and arrival came together ; for to render his march expeditious , he left the baggage of his legions behind him at the river haliacmon , which divides macedonia from thessaly , under the care of marcus favonius , with a guard of eight cohorts , and ordered him to build a strong fort there . 
 then , as an entire year had been granted to them for inquiries , it seemed a shorter plan to begin with his crimes at rome , the witnesses of which were on the spot
 these tidings hastened the plans of galba , who had been long debating the subject of adoption with himself and with his intimate friends
 but neither of them did he strip of the rewards he had given
 accordingly he led his troops out of the camp , and ranged them in order of battle , at first on their own ground , and at a small distance from pompey's camp : but afterward for several days in succession , he advanced from his own camp , and led them up to the hills on which pompey's troops were posted , which conduct inspired his army every day with fresh courage . 
 the only resource left to caesar , was to wait for a fleet from the distant regions of gaul , picenum , and the straits of gibraltar . 
as to its being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command , or advance , he was not at all disturbed at that ; for he knew , that in the case of all those whose army had not been obedient to command , either upon some mismanagement of an affair , fortune had deserted them , or , that upon some crime being discovered , covetousness had been clearly proved .
 for it was feared that the enemy might be strengthened by reinforcements , and change the fortune of the day this policy excited the suspicions of the othonianists , who put a sinister construction on all the acts of their generals
 in the mean time , let the truce be continued till the messengers could return from him ; and let no injury be done on either side . 
 the man , i am aware , had a bad name at rome , and many a foul story was told of him
 in the field indeed they had secured no plunder their rustic adversaries were poor , and their arms worthless
 either let us go over to his system , if it is better than ours , or let those who desire change have their leader and adviser taken from them
 tiberius however , making no change in his voluptuous life , excused himself by letter for his absence from his last duty to his mother on the ground of the pressure of business he even abridged , out of moderation , as it seemed , the honours which the senate had voted on a lavish scale to her memory , allowing only a very few , and adding that no religious worship was to be decreed , this having been her own wish
 their cavalry was defeated , a legion lost its eagle we have still the troops beyond the padus , and otho himself
 having got a fair wind , they sailed out of port and went to nasidius to taurois , which is a fort belonging to the massilians , and there ranged their fleet and again encouraged each other to engage and communicated their plan of operation . 
 the man with the fullest purse was worn out with toil and cruel usage till he bought his furlough his means exhausted by this outlay , and his energies utterly relaxed by idleness , the once rich and vigorous soldier returned to his company a poor and spiritless man
 hence arises a mysterious terror and a pious ignorance concerning the nature of that which is seen only by men doomed to die
 heat and thirst they cannot in the least endure to cold and hunger their climate and their soil inure them
 letters too were scattered through every part of gaul , and in a moment a mighty war burst into flame , for the armies of illyricum were already in open revolt , and the rest were waiting only the signal of success
 but , on the other hand , there were some with whom nothing helped the accused person so much as the excessive power of the accuser
 some cohorts were sent to her aid and a sharp contest followed , which was at first doubtful but had a satisfactory termination
the issue justifies the policy of the man , and since all aimed at one , indutiomarus is slain , having been overtaken at the shawn ford of the river , and his head is carried to the camp , the horse , when returning , pursue and slay all whom they can .
 that people , when ordered to furnish arms and money , voluntarily added a supply of provisions
 cossutianus capito was accused by the people of cilicia he was a man stained with the foulest guilt , and had actually imagined that his audacious wickedness had the same rights in a province as he had claimed for it at rome but he had to confront a determined prosecution , and at last abandoned his defence
 three forts were stormed by them in one day , and the remainder , some from panic , others by the consent of the occupants , capitulated
 those whom the patron had not emancipated with the freedom-giving rod , were still held , as it were , by the bonds of slavery
 yet even to these men , if you give them time , their old vigour will return with the preparation for war
on the following day they move their camp from that place ; caesar does the same , and sends forward all his cavalry , to the number of four thousand , to observe toward what parts the enemy are directing their march .
 as he spoke , he went up to his legions , cheering them and reminding them of their past career , and pointing the way to new glory
 you could not distinguish kinsfolk from strangers , or the laments of men from those of women only the attendants of agrippina , worn out as they were by long sorrow , were surpassed by the mourners who now met them , fresh in their grief
 the next age saw him in tremendous power and a venal creature of the emperor claudius , whose friendship he long used , with success , never for good
he himself , having led his legions into winter quarters among the carnutes , the andes , and the turones , which states were close to those regions in which he had waged war , set out for italy ; and a thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed for those achievements , upon receiving caesar's letter ; which before that time had been conferred on none .
 the chances of the ballot do not discriminate men's characters
 soon afterwards , a letter arrived , in which tiberius traced the origin of the friendship between himself and cotta , enumerated his frequent services , and then requested that words perversely misrepresented and the freedom of table talk might not be construed into a crime
 wherever , he said , the roman turns his eyes , captivity , disaster , and everything that is terrible , confront him
 vistilia , born of a praetorian family , had actually published her name with this object on the aedile's list , according to a recognised custom of our ancestors , who considered it a sufficient punishment on unchaste women to have to profess their shame
 besides this , men themselves eager for power were ready to represent his very vices as virtues
 for didius , burdened with years and covered with honours , was content with acting through his officers and merely holding back the enemy
 henceforth they must pray that he might have self-control , and so be contented so would drusus talk , not unfrequently , or only in the hearing of a few persons
 so ended this servile war amidst the joy of this success , while everything was prosperous beyond his hopes , tidings of the victory of cremona reached vespasian in aegypt
 the rest of africa was garrisoned by two legions , and egypt by the same number next , beginning with syria , all within the entire tract of country stretching as far as the euphrates , was kept in restraint by four legions , and on this frontier were iberian , albanian , and other kings , to whom our greatness was a protection against any foreign power thrace was held by rhoemetalces and the children of cotys the bank of the danube by two legions in pannonia , two in moesia , and two also were stationed in dalmatia , which , from the situation of the country , were in the rear of the other four , and , should italy suddenly require aid , not to distant to be summoned but the capital was garrisoned by its own special soldiery , three city , nine praetorian cohorts , levied for the most part in etruria and umbria , or ancient latium and the old roman colonies
allured by this hope , the germans were then making excursions to greater distances , and had advanced to the territories of the eburones and the condrusi , who are under the protection of the treveri .
 he gave the command of the left wing to antonius , of the right to p sulla , and of the center to cn domitius : he himself took his post opposite pompey at the same time , fearing , from the disposition of the enemy which we have previously mentioned , lest his right wing might be surrounded by their numerous cavalry , he rapidly drafted a single cohort from each of the legions composing the third line , formed of them a fourth line , and opposed them to pompey's cavalry , and , acquainting them with his wishes , admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage . 
 and one of the vestal virgins , laelia , died , and in her place was chosen cornelia , of the family of the cossi
 first came gloomy tidings , and then fugitives from the field , making known that all was lost
 when money was not forthcoming he was bought off by sacrifices to his lust
he openly says in a council that since the germans are said to be approaching , he would not bring into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes , and the next day would move his camp at early dawn .
 while the legions were casting lots for the order of march , the cavalry charged , and , strange to say , were kept only by the courage of the italian legion from being driven back on the entrenchments by an inferior force of othonianists
 this made cerialis move with more rapidity he sent to the mediomatrici persons commissioned to conduct the legions which were there by the shortest route against the enemy and , collecting such troops as there were at mogontiacum and such as he had brought with himself , he arrived in three days' march at rigodulum valentinus , at the head of a large body of treveri , had occupied this position , which was protected by hills , and by the river mosella
 after a time , antiochus , king of that coast , having broken the unity of the barbarian forces , by cajolery of the people and treachery to their leader , slew troxobor and a few chiefs , and pacified the rest by gentle measures
 but he entirely altered the practices of his former greatness he kept the crowds of his visitors at a distance , avoided trains of followers , seldom appeared in rome , as though weak health or philosophical studies detained him at home
 the higher a man's rank , the more eager his hypocrisy , and his looks the more carefully studied , so as neither to betray joy at the decease of one emperor nor sorrow at the rise of another , while he mingled delight and lamentations with his flattery
 towards the river are the frisii , distinguished as the greater and lesser frisii , according to their strength
 yet honour was paid him in death , and his bones , by the senate's decree , were consigned to the sepulchre of the octavii
 the confederate kings were instructed to obey orders , just as the war might require
 a young man of pure life , yet of singular beauty , he had been summoned and dismissed within the space of one night by messalina , who was equally capricious in her passions and dislikes
finding there a fresh body of cavalry , which he had sent on to that place several days before , marching incessantly night and day , he advanced rapidly through the territory of the aedui into that of the lingones , in which two legions were wintering , that , if any plan affecting his own safety should have been organized by the aedui , he might defeat it by the rapidity of his movements .
 at the same time he was reminded of his hatred and jealousy of fabius valens
 this man had , when quaestor in baetica , attached himself with zeal to the party of galba , who had appointed him , young as he was , to the command of a legion , but , it being afterwards discovered that he had embezzled the public money , galba directed that he should be prosecuted for peculation
 men and women of every age crowding to the place because it was near rome and so the calamity was all the more fatal
 if nero were to rule , or britannicus succeed to the throne , he would himself have no claim on the then reigning sovereign
 it will not be your moderation , if you restore me your wealth , not your love of quiet , if you forsake your emperor , but my avarice , the fear of my cruelty , which will be in all men's mouths
 the next territory was that of the lingones who were loyal to vitellius
 indeed , vitellius used to make a display of his admiration for nero , and had constantly followed him when he sang , not from the compulsion to which the noblest had to yield , but because he was the slave and chattel of profligacy and gluttony
 only that division suffered which had wound its way along narrow and slippery roads to the left quarter of the city as far as the gardens of sallust
then at length liscus , moved by caesar's speech , discloses what he had hitherto kept secret : —that there are some whose influences with the people is very great , who , though private men , have more power than the magistrates themselves : that these by seditions and violent language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought to supply ; that , if they can not any longer retain the supremacy of gaul , it were better to submit to the government of gauls than of romans , nor ought they to doubt that , if the romans should overpower the helvetii , they would wrest their freedom from the aedui together with the remainder of gaul .
 the curse of usury was indeed of old standing in rome and a most frequent cause of sedition and discord , and it was therefore repressed even in the early days of a less corrupt morality
 the priest of the line of cinyras is alone consulted
 his brothers , magnus and crassus , had been put to death by claudius and nero respectively
 what remained but to take the sword and chose for their generals and emperors those whose images they had followed as standards
if these sacrifices should appear heavy or galling , that they ought to consider it much more distressing that their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery , and themselves slain ; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered .
 even the barbarians now learnt to excuse many attractive vices , and the occurrence of the civil war gave a good pretext for inaction but we were sorely troubled with mutiny , as troops habituated to service grew demoralised by idleness
 he was followed by 60 , 000 armed soldiers demoralized by licence
 but though it may be pardonable to have allowed this once , it would be a vain and arrogant thing to receive the sacred honour of images representing the divine throughout all the provinces , and the homage paid to augustus will disappear if it is vulgarised by indiscriminate flattery
 by their silence , by their submission , finally by their tears and entreaties , they craved forgiveness
but when caesar discovered this , he commanded those through whose territory they had gone , to seek them out and to bring them back again , if they meant to be acquitted before him ; and considered them , when brought back , in the light of enemies ; he admitted all the rest to a surrender , upon their delivering up the hostages , arms , and deserters .
 julius caesar , holding the election as dictator , was himself appointed consul with publius servilius ; for this was the year in which it was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul . 
 he is tedious in his introductions , lengthy in his narrations , careless about digressions
 early in this year a war between parthia and rome about the possession of armenia , which , feebly begun , had hitherto dragged on , was vigorously resumed for vologeses would not allow his brother tiridates to be deprived of a kingdom which he had himself given him , or to hold it as a gift from a foreign power , and corbulo too thought it due to the grandeur of rome that he should recover what lucullus and pompeius had formerly won
 he had laid in vast quantities of corn from thessaly , asia , egypt , crete , cyrene , and other countries . 
 intelligence was shortly after received of the action in thessaly , so well authenticated , that the pompeians themselves gave credit to it ; for they had hitherto believed it a fiction of caesar's lieutenants and friends . 
 the 16th legion , with the auxiliary troops that capitulated at the same time , received orders to march from novesium to the colony of the treveri , a day having been fixed by which they were to quit the camp
 the assassins closed in round her couch , and the captain of the trireme first struck her head violently with a club
the soldiers , on the signal being given , quickly advance to this fortification , and passing over it , make themselves masters of the separate camps and so great was their activity in taking the camps , that teutomarus , the king of the nitiobriges , being suddenly surprised in his tent , as he had gone to rest at noon , with difficulty escaped from the hands of the plunderers , with the upper part of his person naked , and his horse wounded .
 tutor had been made by vitellius guardian of the banks of the rhine
 i count you better than myself your house is ennobled by the glories of a triumph it has two youthful scions , one of whom is already equal to the cares of empire , and in the earliest years of his military career won renown with these very armies of germany
 two legions , the first and twentieth , with veterans discharged and serving under a standard , were there in winter-quarters
 drusus , without awaiting the envoys' return , as for the present all was quiet , went back to rome
 this circumstance was advantageous to the state as well as to the cause of vespasian had the army fresh from victory , and with all the pride of success added to its natural obstinacy , marched upon rome , a conflict of no slight magnitude , and involving the destruction of the capital , must have ensued
 subsequently , by a bill brought in by the tribunes , interest was reduced to half that amount , and finally compound interest was wholly forbidden
 the slaughter that followed was made particularly memorable through the murder of a father by his son
upon the delivery of this speech , the minds of all were changed in a surprising manner , and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecuting the war were engendered ; and the tenth legion was the first to return thanks to him , through their military tribunes , for his having expressed this most favorable opinion of them ; and assured him that they were quite ready to prosecute the war .
 the enemy's forces were increasing , and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from the camp through the town , that fresh men might relieve the weary . 
 the freedmen do not rank much above slaves , and are seldom of any weight in the family , never in the state , with the exception of those tribes which are ruled by kings
 there should be no phrase stained , so to speak , with rust
but caesar , placing guards on the rampart , forbade them to be admitted .
 they retired behind these mountains that they might avoid caesar's cavalry , and , placing parties in the narrow roads , stop the progress of his army and lead their own forces across the ebro without danger or apprehension . 
 we , who have been called to power by the issues of war , and by the deliberate judgment of others , shall incur unpopularity , however illustrious our character
 but nothing impressed tiberius more deeply than the enthusiasm kindled in favor of agrippina , whom men spoke of as the glory of the country , the sole surviving off spring of augustus , the solitary example of the old times , while looking up to heaven and the gods they prayed for the safety of her children and that they might outlive their oppressors
 and in like manner , whatever additional assistance was sent , was infected by the fears of the defeated , and increased the terror and danger . 
publius considius , who was reputed to be very experienced in military affairs , and had been in the army of lucius sulla , and afterward in that of marcus crassus , is sent forward with the scouts .
 their only relief from misery was to quit an ill-omened and polluted camp , and , having purged themselves of their guilt , to betake themselves again every one to his winterquarters
 let the property of the slain come into a common stock , so that no one may be able to secrete anything , or to detach his own interest from ours
the rest of the contest depended on courage ; in which our men decidedly had the advantage ; and the more so , because the whole action was carried on in the sight of caesar and the entire army ; so that no act , a little more valiant than ordinary , could pass unobserved , for all the hills and higher grounds , from which there was a near prospect of the sea were occupied by our army .
 everything alike was unfavourable to the romans , the place with its deep swamps , insecure to the foot and slippery as one advanced , limbs burdened with coats of mail , and the impossibility of aiming their javelins amid the water
 he was to have the rest of their message when the first part had been successful
 we are a roman colony , a part of the roman army , sharers in your successes and reverses fortune may declare against us do not abandon us to an angry foe
 the people carried round the temples images of galba , ornamented with laurel leaves and flowers , and piled chaplets in the form of a sepulchral mound near the lake of curtius , on the very spot which had been stained with the blood of the dying man
 as i am about to relate the last days of a famous city , it seems appropriate to throw some light on its origin
 there was a sort of root called chara , discovered by the troops which served under valerius . 
the camp attendants and the horse following close upon them with the same impetuosity , are saved by the courage of the soldiers .
 certainly during the whole of his illness the emperor's chief freedmen and confidential physicians came more frequently than is usual with a court which pays its visits by means of messengers
our troops , laying aside their javelins , carry on the engagement with their swords .
 it is to these that the vilest of the provincials instantly attach themselves
 cerialis mercilessly ravaged the island of the batavi , but , with a policy familiar to commanders , left untouched the estates and houses of civilis meanwhile , however , the autumn was far advanced , and the river , swollen by the continual rains of the season , overflowed the island , marshy and low-lying as it is , till it resembled a lake
almost at the same time , a little before daylight , intelligence was given to the enemy that there was an unusual tumult in the camp of the romans , and that a strong force was marching up the river , and that the sound of oars was distinctly heard in the same quarter , and that soldiers were being conveyed across in ships a little below .
 vitellius had sat down to a banquet at ticinum , and had invited verginius to be his guest
 this plan being settled , and his conduct approved of , he is informed by some deserters from the town that juba had staid behind in his own kingdom , being called home by a neighboring war , and a dispute with the people of leptis ; and that sabura , his commander-in-chief , who had been sent with a small force , was drawing near to utica . 
whether they did this for the reason which they alleged to the lieutenants , or influenced by treachery , we think that we ought not to state as certain , because we have no proof .
 he had too in his son annaeus lucanus a powerful aid in rising to distinction
 they had both alike to struggle against the domineering spirit of agrippina , who inflamed with all the passions of an evil ascendency had pallas on her side , at whose suggestion claudius had ruined himself by an incestuous marriage and a fatal adoption of a son
 they acted not from fear or affection , but from the mere love of servitude
 armenia was then abandoned , and the fortunes of artabanus were overthrown , vitellius persuading his subjects to forsake a king who was a tyrant in peace , and ruinously unsuccessful in war
 among them he meets with ulcilles hirrus fleeing from camerinum , with six cohorts , which he had in the garrison there ; by a junction with which he made up thirteen cohorts . 
 they rode over at full speed , and broke into the dwelling of the proconsul in the dim light of early dawn , with their swords drawn in their hands many of them were unacquainted with the person of piso , for the legate had selected some moorish and carthaginian auxiliaries to perpetrate the deed
 the semnones give themselves out to be the most ancient and renowned branch of the suevi
 for , as i have said , augustus was his great-uncle , antonius his grandfather , and vivid images of disaster and success rose before him on the spot
 he had seen the sad countenances of the citizens , he heard their secret complainings at the prospect of his entering on so long a journey , when they could not bear so much as his brief excursions , accustomed as they were to cheer themselves under mischances by the sight of the emperor
from them he learns that the capital town of cassivellaunus was not far from that place , and was defended by woods and morasses , and a very large number of men and of cattle had been collected in it .
 often , as he rose from the emperor's table , was he heard repeatedly to say that he was going to her , to the high birth and beauty which had fallen to his lot , to that which all men pray for , the joy of the fortunate
 and as the country was deficient in water , he established forts to guard the wells , and concealed some of the streams with heaps of sand
 the senators did not desist from threatening gestures , till he quitted the chamber then passing to paccius africanus , they assailed him in the same way
at length , worn out with wounds , they began to give way , and , as there was in the neighborhood a mountain about a mile off , to betake themselves thither .
when they have leant upon them , according to their habit , they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees , and fall down themselves along with them .
 but do not spurn mucianus as an associate , because you do not find in him a rival
 and soon afterwards the emperor in honouring junius blaesus proconsul of africa , with triumphal distinctions , said that he granted them as a compliment to sejanus , whose uncle blaesus was
 the rest are still what the gauls once were
 the veterans of the 13th legion , four cohorts of auxiliaries , and 500 cavalry , were drawn up on the left side of the road
 the german veterans wavered long their frames were still enfeebled by sickness , and their minds were favourably disposed towards galba , who , finding them exhausted by their long return voyage from alexandria , whither they had been sent on by nero , had supplied their wants with a most unsparing attention
 pharasmanes accordingly seeing the young prince had power in his grasp and was strong in the attachment of his people , fearing too his own declining years , tempted him with other prospects and pointed to armenia , which , as he reminded him , he had given to mithridates after driving out the parthians
 amid the adventures of these illustrious men , one is ashamed to relate how a certain mariccus , a boian of the lowest origin , pretending to divine inspiration , ventured to thrust himself into fortune's game , and to challenge the arms of rome
 but it was a vision of the night that was the actual charge against one of them he had , it was alleged , beheld claudius crowned with a garland of wheat , the ears of which were turned downwards , and , from this appearance , he foretold scanty harvests
 pressed by agrippina's menaces , having no charge against his brother and not daring openly to order his murder , he meditated a secret device and directed poison to be prepared through the agency of julius pollio , tribune of one of the praetorian cohorts , who had in his custody a woman under sentence for poisoning , locusta by name , with a vast reputation for crime
 subsequently by the permission of hercules , when he was subduing lydia , the grandeur of the temple's ceremonial was augmented , and during the persian rule its privileges were not curtailed
 do you know , he said of your divorce
 lucceius albinus , whom nero had appointed to the government of mauritania caesariensis , to which galba had subsequently added the charge of the province of tingitana , had the disposal of no contemptible force
 his first attempts hordeonius flaccus had encouraged by affecting ignorance
 flaccus , by his many concessions , had produced no other effect but to make them insist with more energy on what they knew he must refuse
 the 3rd legion , old troops of varus arrius , were sent back to syria
 they did not consider , in addition , that the contest was not decided by a vigorous attack , nor a regular battle ; and that our men had suffered greater loss from their numbers and want of room , than they had sustained from the enemy . 
 he received a vote of thanks , and it was decreed that on the seventeenth of october , the day on which both perished , through all future years , an offering should be consecrated to jupiter
 which of us will be rescued by his domestics , who , even with the dread of punishment before them , regard not our dangers
 he was supported too with a force of a thousand legionaries , three allied cohorts and two squadrons of cavalry , that he might the more easily secure his new kingdom
 meanwhile there was a most encouraging augury eight eagles , seen to fly towards the woods and to enter them , caught the general's eye
 all this passed in the sight of both armies , and the more it delighted the vitellianists , the more vehemently did the othonianists curse the cause and author of the disaster
 they possessed themselves of some arms and some vessels , both of which they wanted , while they became very famous throughout germany as the champions of liberty
he ordered publius sulpicius rufus , his legate , to hold possession of the harbor , with such a garrison as he thought sufficient .
marcus petreius , a centurion of the same legion , after attempting to hew down the gates , was overpowered by numbers , and , despairing of his safety , having already received many wounds , said to the soldiers of his own company who followed him : since i can not save you as well as myself , i shall at least provide for your safety , since i , allured by the love of glory , led you into this danger , do you save yourselves when an opportunity is given .
caesar having received the letter about the eleventh hour of the day , immediately sends a messenger to the bellovaci , to m .
 he then pushed on by forced marches to augustodunum , his standard-bearers vying in zeal , and even the privates loudly protesting against any halt for their usual rest or during the hours of night
 as soon , however , as augustus was dead , he had given the watchword to the praetorian cohorts , as commander-in-chief
 he ought to have gone himself and confronted with his imperial majesty those who would have soon yielded , when they once saw a sovereign of long experience , who was the supreme dispenser of rigour or of bounty
 in the mean time , the soldiers , under cover of the musculus , were rooting out with crow-bars the lowest stones of the enemy's turret , with which the foundation was laid . 
 without even taking time to form into line , disordered and weary as they were , they commenced the action
 there then ensued a notable quarrel , licinius caecina inveighing against marcellus eprius , for using ambiguous language
 was it only sons who were to visit them
 at first too our alphabet was scanty , and additions were afterwards made following this precedent claudius added three letters , which were employed during his reign and subsequently disused
 he ordered the horse to follow him , and hastened his march , that he might attack them as soon as possible , while in consternation after their flight . 
 two days were then assigned for the bringing forward of the charges , and after six days' interval , the prisoner's defence was to occupy three days
 then ensued a scene of discordant clamour , of accident , and uncertainty , where no one could see how to aim or to avoid a blow
 the rest of the world , i see , does not differ from my opinion about him
 the feelings of the soldiers were not seriously affected either with joy or alarm
 while they were thus occupied , the time for their departure arrived , and proved even more dismal than their anticipation
 instantly they rushed from all parts on the camp-prefect , and legionary cohorts left to establish fortified positions among the silures , and had not speedy succour arrived from towns and fortresses in the neighbourhood , our forces would then have been totally destroyed
 the barbarians , too , welcomed him with rejoicing , as is usual with new rulers
 this pharasmanes , who was king of the iberians and mithridates' brother , now told him that the parthians were divided , and that the highest questions of empire being uncertain , lesser matters were neglected
after receiving many wounds on all sides , and having forced no part of the works , when day drew nigh , fearing lest they should be surrounded by a sally made from the higher camp on the exposed flank , they retreated to their countrymen .
 amidst all this a mutiny in the army all but broke out
 the real cause of their destruction was that they had lent their house for the meetings of mnester and poppaea
 much of what he said was in roman speech , for he had served in our camp as leader of his fellow-countrymen
report of these events is rapidly borne into transalpine gaul .
 his infantry he drew up so that part might advance on level ground into the forest , and part clamber up the earthwork which confronted them
 but the gladiator has not in battle the firmness of the regular soldier , and now , as they stood on rocking vessels , they could not direct their blows like men who had a sure footing on land
he , addressing himself to diviciacus , the aeduan , with great earnestness , points out how much it concerns the republic and their common security , that the forces of the enemy should be divided , so that it might not be necessary to engage with so large a number at one time .
 caecina dismissed the tribunes and rode back to the camp there he found that fabius valens had given the signal for battle , and that the troops were under arms

 aponius was clamoured down by the shouts of the soldiers , when he attempted to address them
 ostorius , well aware that first events are those which produce alarm or confidence , by a rapid movement of his light cohorts , cut down all who opposed him , pursued those who fled , and lest they should rally , and so an unquiet and treacherous peace might allow no rest to the general and his troops , he prepared to disarm all whom he suspected , and to occupy with encampments the whole country to the avon and severn

 when marcellus perceived this , he made as if he would leave the house , exclaiming , we go , priscus , and leave you your senate
 at the same instant there was a mighty stir as of departure
in these pits tapering stakes , of the thickness of a man's thigh ; sharpened at the top and hardened in the fire , were sunk in such a manner as to project from the ground not more than four inches ; at the same time for the purpose of giving them strength and stability , they were each filled with trampled clay to the height of one foot from the bottom : the rest of the pit was covered over with osiers and twigs , to conceal the deceit .
 accordingly they cut off two of our auxiliary cohorts , the rapacity of whose officers let them make incautious forays
 displeased at this conduct , their soldiers went in a body to caesar , and openly complained of their ill usage ; and to their other charges added , that false musters were given in to caesar , and the surcharged pay applied to their own use . 
 he wrote instructions to publius atellius hister , governor of pannonia , that he was to have his legions , with some picked auxiliaries from the province itself , encamped on the riverbank , as a support to the conquered and a terror to the conqueror , who might otherwise , in the elation of success , disturb also the peace of our empire
 but dispersing and avoiding one another , they sought the shelter of distant and pathless wilds
 but more than the number specified came forward , and openly protested , as they marched , that they would not endure any longer the hardships of famine and the treachery of the legates

 therefore , despairing of their own safety , as men usually do in the last moment of their lives , they either lamented their unhappy deaths , or recommended their parents to the survivors , if fortune should save any from the impending danger . 
 next the emperor brought forward a motion for the election of a vestal virgin in the room of occia , who for fifty-seven years had presided with the most immaculate virtue over the vestal worship

 these colonnades nero promised to erect at his own expense , and to hand over the open spaces , when cleared of the debris , to the ground landlords
 and what were the motives of this conflict
here it might be learned how much fortune achieves in war , and how great casualties she produces .
 they then assailed the opposite approaches to the capitol , near the grove of the asylum , and where the tarpeian rock is mounted by a hundred steps
 when the tribune reported this answer in the presence of poppaea and tigellinus , the emperor's most confidential advisers in his moments of rage , he asked whether seneca was meditating suicide

it happened that night to be full moon , which usually occasions very high tides in that ocean ; and that circumstance was unknown to our men .
resistance is made by our men in the same manner as the day before ; this same thing is done afterward during the remaining days .
 the ubii did not remain quiet , but made predatory excursions into germany , escaping at first with impunity , though they were afterwards cut off throughout the whole of this war , they were more loyal than fortunate
 i can hardly venture on any positive statement about the consular elections , now held for the first time under this emperor , or , indeed , subsequently , so conflicting are the accounts we find not only in historians but in tiberius' own speeches
 nero accordingly avoided secret interviews with her , and when she withdrew to her gardens or to her estates at tusculum and antium , he praised her for courting repose

 on the one side was caecina at the head of a powerful army , on the other were the auxiliary infantry and cavalry of rhaetia and the youth of that province , inured to arms and exercised in habits of warfare

 aurelius cotta , too , and haterius antonius had yearly stipends assigned them by the emperor , though they had squandered their ancestral wealth in profligacy
 claudius , though often entreated , declined to interpose by arms in the conflict of the barbarians , and simply promised vannius a safe refuge in the event of his expulsion
 in italy meanwhile the old town of puteoli obtained from nero the privileges of a colony with an additional name
there was among the carnutes a man named tasgetius , born of very high rank , whose ancestors had held the sovereignty in his state .
 the senate clamorously interrupted , with an affectation of horror , but they were penetrated by alarm and amazement at seeing that a hitherto cunning prince , who had shrouded his wickedness in mystery , had waxed so bold as to remove , so to speak , the walls of his house and display his grandson under a centurion's lash , amid the buffetings of slaves , craving in vain the last sustenance of life
this place he selected as well on other accounts as because the fortifications of the previous year remained , in order that he might relieve the labor of the soldiers .
 every operation was at the same moment successful the pillagers were cut to pieces dissensions broke out among the besiegers , and the king made a well-timed sally just as the legion arrived
but if any thing very severe from caesar should befall him , no one would think that it had been done without his consent , since he himself held such a place in caesar's friendship : from which circumstance it would arise , that the affections of the whole of gaul would be estranged from him .
 at rome meanwhile trophies for the parthian war , and arches were erected in the centre of the capitoline hill these had been decreed by the senate , while the war was yet undecided , and even now they were not given up , appearances being consulted , in disregard of known facts
 many were covered in with decks , on which engines for missiles might be conveyed , and were also fit for the carrying of horses or supplies , and being equipped with sails as well as rapidly moved by oars , they assumed , through the enthusiasm of our soldiers , an imposing and formidable aspect
 the real power of the empire was divided between t

 but , it will be said , marriage with a brother's daughter is with us a novelty
 it was also decided that the augury of the public safety , which for twenty-five years had been neglected , should be revived and henceforth observed

 pompey's route being easy , because he was not obliged to cross the river , he advanced rapidly and by forced marches against antonius , and being informed of his approach , chose a convenient situation , where he posted his forces ; and kept his men close within camp , and forbade fires to be kindled , that his arrival might be the more secret . 
 do you suppose that nero will be the last of the tyrants
 and now the pompeians , after great havoc of our troops , were approaching marcellinus's camp , and had struck no small terror into the rest of the cohorts , when marcus antonius , who commanded the nearest fort , being informed of what had happened , was observed descending from the rising ground with twelve cohorts . 
during the remaining days after this , caesar began to cut down the forests ; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the soldiers , while unarmed and not foreseeing it , he placed together all that timber which was cut down , and piled it up as a rampart on either flank .

 then too the chieftains of the several tribes went from rank to rank , encouraging and confirming the spirit of their men by making light of their fears , kindling their hopes , and by every other warlike incitement as for caractacus , he flew hither and thither , protesting that that day and that battle would be the beginning of the recovery of their freedom , or of everlasting bondage
 there was , moreover , a circumstance that confirmed them in this resolution : for of the two adverse parties , that , which had stood by sertorius in the late war , being conquered by pompey , still trembled at his name and sway , though absent : the other which had remained firm in pompey's interest , loved him for the favors which they had received : but caesar's name was not known to the barbarians . 
 the latter was to be admitted into the julian family with the name of augusta
caesar restrained his men from battle , deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine , forage , and depredation .
therefore , that this might not happen , having pitched his camp in a woody place opposite to one of those bridges which vercingetorix had taken care should be broken down , the next day he stopped behind with two legions in a secret place ; he sent on the rest of the forces as usual , with all the baggage , after having selected some cohorts , that the number of the legions might appear to be complete .
at the same time the ambarri , the friends and kinsmen of the aedui , apprize caesar , that it was not easy for them , now that their fields had been devastated , to ward off the violence of the enemy from their towns : the allobroges likewise , who had villages and possessions on the other side of the rhône , betake themselves in flight to caesar , and assure him that they had nothing remaining , except the soil of their land .

 there was a physician , distinguished in his profession , of the name of charicles , usually employed , not indeed to have the direction of the emperor's varying health , but to put his advice at immediate disposal
 having observed this , he ordered other legions to be brought to him from asia , which he had made up out of pompey's soldiers ; for he was himself detained against his will , by the etesian winds , which are totally unfavorable to persons on a voyage from alexandria . 
 nor do they owe this to the three hundred million sesterces of the one , although it may seem that they must thank their eloquence for having attained such wealth
 these things being made known to caesar , he harangued his soldiers ; he reminded them of the wrongs done to him at all times by his enemies , and complained that pompey had been alienated from him and led astray by them through envy and a malicious opposition to his glory , though he had always favored and promoted pompey's honor and dignity . 
 the most practical and the shortest method of distinguishing between good and bad measures , is to think what you yourself would or would not like under another emperor
 soon , a hailstorm bursting from a black mass of clouds , while the waves rolled hither and thither under tempestuous gales from every quarter , rendered clear sight impossible , and the steering difficult , while our soldiers , terrorstricken and without any experience of disasters on the sea , by embarrassing the sailors or giving them clumsy aid , neutralized the services of the skilled crews after a while , wind and wave shifted wholly to the south , and from the hilly lands and deep rivers of germany came with a huge line of rolling clouds , a strong blast , all the more frightful from the frozen north which was so near to them , and instantly caught and drove the ships hither and thither into the open ocean , or on islands with steep cliffs or which hidden shoals made perilous
 a eunuch named pothinus , the boy's tutor , was regent of the kingdom on account of his youthfulness . 
 then he entered on his defence claudius he moved profoundly , and he even drew tears from messalina
on these they placed their women , who , with disheveled hair and in tears , entreated the soldiers , as they went forward to battle , not to deliver them into slavery to the romans .
caesar , having conveyed his baggage to the nearest hill , and having left two legions to guard it , pursued as far as the time of day would permit , and after slaying about three thousand of the rear of the enemy , encamped at alesia on the next day .
if this took place , he saw that it would be attended with great danger to the province to have warlike men , enemies of the roman people , bordering upon an open and very fertile tract of country .
 he found in judaea three legions , the 5th , the 10th , and the 15th , all old troops of vespasian's

but even if he were willing to forget their former outrage , could he also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs , in that they had against his will attempted a route through the province by force , in that they had molested the aedui , the ambarri , and the allobroges ? that as to their so insolently boasting of their victory , and as to their being astonished that they had so long committed their outrages with impunity , tended to the same point ; for the immortal gods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to punish for their guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity , in order that they may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances .
 then they were strangled and their bodies , mere children as they were , were flung down the gemoniae
 that of her former husband , domitius silus
 the vanquished legions were then scattered throughout illyricum for civil war was not over , and they might play a doubtful part
when the ropes which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by them and pulled , and our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars , they were severed ; and when they were cut away , the yards necessarily fell down ; so that as all the hope of the gallic vessels depended on their sails and rigging , upon these being cut away , the entire management of the ships was taken from them at the same time .
caesar , when he perceived that the seventh legion , which stood close by him , was also hard pressed by the enemy , directed the tribunes of the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually , and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front ; which having been done , since they brought assistance the one to the other , nor feared lest their rear should be surrounded by the enemy , they began to stand their ground more boldly , and to fight more courageously .
 libo came and made an apology for bibulus , that he was a man of strong passion , and had a private quarrel against caesar , contracted when he was aedile and praetor ; that for this reason he had avoided the conference , lest affairs of the utmost importance and advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper . 
 go , they said , to avenge us and utterly destroy this home of gallic rebellion
when caesar observed these things , having called a council , and summoned to it the centurions of all the companies , he severely reprimanded them , particularly , for supposing that it belonged to them to inquire or conjecture , either in what direction they were marching , or with what object .
 during the same consulship , vipsanius laenas was condemned for rapacity in his administration of the province of sardinia

 otho now began to praise his wife's beauty and accomplishments to the emperor , either from a lover's thoughtlessness or to inflame nero's passion , in the hope of adding to his own influence by the further tie which would arise out of possession of the same woman
 driven by stress of weather to the island of cythnus , he induced certain soldiers , who were on their way from the east , to join him , and ordered others , who refused , to be executed he also robbed the traders and armed all the most able bodied of the slaves
in this manner he prepares to await the succors from gaul , and carry on the war .
 before long the tactics of tacfarinas were encountered in a similar fashion
 the bridge of ilerda afforded an opportunity of getting all these without any danger , and the places beyond the bridge , to which caesar had no access , were as yet untouched . 
 just as if in a three years' interval an opportunity was wanting for the trial of an old ex-consul and the father of a number of ex-consuls
these military works they had learned from our men in the intercourse of former years , and , having taken some of our army prisoners , were instructed by them : but , as they had no supply of iron tools which are requisite for this service , they were forced to cut the turf with their swords , and to empty out the earth with their hands and cloaks , from which circumstance , the vast number of the men could be inferred ; for in less than three hours they completed a fortification of ten miles in circumference ; and during the rest of the days they began to prepare and construct towers of the height of the ramparts , and grappling irons , and mantelets , which the same prisoners had taught them .
 an active officer at home , without experience in war , he founded perpetual accusations on the high influence of paullinus , on the energy of celsus , on the mature judgment of gallus , in fact , on each man's special excellence , a thing most easy to do
lucius aurunculeius , and several tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions of the first rank , were of opinion that nothing should be done hastily , and that they should not depart from the camp without caesar's orders ; they declared , that any forces of the germans , however great , might be encountered by fortified winter-quarters ; that this fact was a proof ; that they had sustained the first assault of the germans most valiantly , inflicting many wounds upon them ; that they were not distressed for corn ; that in the mean time relief would come both from the nearest winter-quarters and from caesar ; lastly , they put the query , what could be more undetermined , more undignified , than to adopt measures respecting the most important affairs on the authority of an enemy ? .
 the same year witnessed the establishment of religious ceremonies in a new priesthood of the brotherhood of the augustales , just as in former days titus tatius , to retain the rites of the sabines , had instituted the titian brotherhood

 nor was it always punishment , but far oftener penitence , which satisfied him
 two hills of great height were fenced in by walls which had been skilfully obliqued or bent inwards , in such a manner that the flank of an assailant was exposed to missiles
 brutus sailed to the same place with an augmented fleet ; for to those made by caesar at arelas were added six ships taken from the massilians , which he had refitted since the last battle and had furnished with every necessary . 
 besides the terror of the law , crispus had exerted his own power to the utmost to destroy the man who had informed against his brother he had prevailed upon a great part of the senate to demand that he should be consigned to destruction , undefended and unheard
 caecina's motion was thus defeated at the senate's next meeting came a letter from tiberius , which indirectly censured them for throwing on the emperor every political care , and named marcus lepidus and junius blaesus , one of whom was to be chosen pro-consul of africa
 the destruction of private wealth precipitated the fall of rank and reputation , till at last the emperor interposed his aid by distributing throughout the banks a hundred million sesterces , and allowing freedom to borrow without interest for three years , provided the borrower gave security to the state in land to double the amount
 several prodigies occurred in that year
 does the nature of things , does the rapid flight of opportunities , admit of all intelligence being publicly announced , of every plan being discussed in the presence of all
 at dawn he fell with his breast upon the steel hearing a groan from the dying man , his freedmen and slaves , and plotius firmus , prefect of the praetorian guard , came in
 divine honours were decreed to claudius , and his funeral rites were solemnized on the same scale as those of augustus for agrippina strove to emulate the magnificence of her great-grandmother , livia
 the rest of the booty fell to the conquerors corbulo's lieutenant and camp-prefect met with similar success
 this , if proved , would not have been fatal to the defendant , if he cleared himself as to his late conduct , and , if refuted , would not have secured his acquittal , if he were convicted of the greater crimes
 to them , for these reasons , he had committed the offices of greatest honor in their own country , and took care to have them chosen into the senate at an unusual age , and had bestowed on them lands taken from the enemy , and large pecuniary rewards , and from being needy had made them affluent . 
this affair having been known , all the forces of the eburones and the nervii which had assembled , depart ; and for a short time after this action , caesar was less harassed in the government of gaul .
 the other generals , whose moderation or insignificance had shut them out from distinction in the war , had accordingly no share in its prizes
 he was indeed , as i have said , a kind-hearted man
 during the same consulship a hearing was given to two conflicting deputations from puteoli , sent to the senate by the town council and by the populace the first spoke bitterly of the violence of the multitude the second , of the rapacity of the magistrates and of all the chief citizens

 he had , in fact , occupied tigranocerta , a city strong from the multitude of its defenders and the vastness of its fortifications
litavicus , with his clansmen , who after the custom of the gauls consider it a crime to desert their patrons , even in extreme misfortune , flees forth to gergovia .
 they had thrown aside the insignia of their rank , and they demanded release from the toils and perils of service
 there he lived up to the time of the civil wars , not in the fashion of his disgraceful past , but uprightly and virtuously , a pleasure-loving man when idle , and self-restrained when in power
 on the day the senate met , jaded with fear and mental anguish , or , as some have related , feigning illness , he was carried in a litter to the doors of the senate house , and leaning on his brother he raised his hands and voice in supplication to tiberius , who received him with unmoved countenance
 what followed , may be deplored rather than defended
 tiberius did not venture on a public execution , but ordered him to be slain in a private part of the palace and his body to be secretly removed
this matter being brought to a council , when he discovered that all thought the same thing , he appointed the next day for the fight .
 the fresh troops were driven back along with the wounded fugitives , confused by their own alarm and by the difficulties of the road
 that should he turn back , the conqueror would certainly be offended , but with the issue of the struggle still doubtful , and the father joining the party , the son would be excused
 an exile and a fugitive he could only be a burden to those who entertained him , and they had already trespassed enough in crossing the rhine so often
the romans having faced about , advanced to the attack in two divisions ; the first and second line , to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off the field ; the third to receive those who were just arriving .
 our cavalry fought with indecisive success
 besides , it was the most distressing season of the year , when there was no corn in the blade , and it was nearly ripe : and the states were exhausted , because afranius had conveyed almost all the corn , before caesar's arrival , into ilerda , and whatever he had left , had been already consumed by caesar . 
 having obtained it , he was escorted out of town ; nor did the soldiers of domitius leave him till they brought him into caesar's presence . 
 well , even in a beaten army when every tenth man is felled by the club , the lot falls also on the brave
 when the batavians were near the camp at bonna , they sent on before them delegates , commissioned to deliver to herennius gallus a message from the cohorts
 he enlarged on the zeal of the soldiery
 only a name , they said , and an authority were wanted only , in fact , that , with caesar's consent , a scion of the house of arsaces should show himself on the banks of the euphrates
 marcellus , overawed by his reproofs , retracted his opinion . 
the day following he led his forces past caesar's camp , and encamped two miles beyond him ; with this design that he might cut off caesar from the corn and provisions , which might be conveyed to him from the sequani and the aedui .
 he could not however make any attack on the supplies , as they were brought over mountains in the occupation of our forces corbulo , that war might not be uselessly protracted , and also to compel the armenians to defend their possessions , prepared to destroy their fortresses , himself undertaking the assault on the strongest of all in that province named volandum

 hence followed a scarcity of money , a great shock being given to all credit , the current coin too , in consequence of the conviction of so many persons and the sale of their property , being locked up in the imperial treasury or the public exchequer
 but as soon as she had secured her pardon through the secret intercessions of augusta , she gradually withdrew from her husband and separated her defence from his
 nor may a man thus disgraced be present at the sacred rites , or enter their council
 he scarcely avoided giving offence from year to year , even though a candidate's rejection was solaced by the near prospect of office
 but mucianus found his principal cause of apprehension in primus antonius and varus arrius , who , in the freshness of their fame , while distinguished by great achievements and by the attachment of the soldiery , were also supported by the people , because in no case had they extended their severities beyond the battle-field
upon being apprized of caesar's arrival , ariovistus sends embassadors to him , that what he had before requested as to a conference , might now , as far as his permission went , take place , since he had approached nearer , and he considered that he might now do it without danger .
 otho had ordered the 7th cohort to be brought up to rome from ostia , and the charge of arming it was entrusted to varius crispinus , one of the tribunes of the praetorian guard
 at rome report exaggerated all these disasters , and disturbed mucianus with the fear that the generals , though distinguished men for he had already appointed gallus annius and petilius cerialis to the command , would be unequal to the weight of so vast a war
 while these things were debated before caesar , and he was very anxious to settle the royal disputes as a common friend and arbitrator ; news was brought on a sudden that the king's army and all his cavalry , were on their march to alexandria .

 his own money , on the other hand , had been acquired by industry and was not excessive
 he made no military preparation he did not seek to invigorate the soldiers by encouraging speeches or warlike exercises he did not keep himself before the eyes of the people buried in the shades of his gardens , like those sluggish animals which , if you supply them with food , lie motionless and torpid , he had dismissed with the same forgetfulness the past , the present , and the future
 agreeable and popular as this conduct would have been , had it been prompted by noble qualities , it was looked upon as undignified and contemptible from the remembrance of his past life
meanwhile , caesar kept daily importuning the aedui for the corn which they had promised in the name of their state ; for , in consequence of the coldness , not only was the corn in the fields not ripe , but there was not in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder : besides he was unable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river saône , because the helvetii , from whom he was unwilling to retire had diverted their march from the saône .
when caesar observed this , he ordered the boats of the ships of war and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers , and sent them up to the succor of those whom he had observed in distress .
he himself , fearing a greater commotion in gaul , in order to prevent his being surrounded by all the states , began to form plans as to the manner in which he should return from gergovia and again concentrate his forces , lest a departure arising from the fear of a revolt should seem like a flight .
 in the centre of the field were the whitening bones of men , as they had fled , or stood their ground , strewn everywhere or piled in heaps
 the danube pours down from the gradual and gently rising slope of mount abnoba , and visits many nations , to force its way at last through six channels into the pontus

 first annoying us by a distant volley then , as they found that very many of their missiles fixed themselves harmlessly in the turrets and battlements of the walls , and they themselves suffered from the stones showered down on them , they fell on the entrenchment with a shout and furious rush , many placing their scaling-ladders against the ramparts , and others mounting on a testudo formed by their comrades
 his departure was attended by a small retinue , one senator , who was an ex-consul , cocceius nerva , learned in the laws , one roman knight , besides sejanus , of the highest order , curtius atticus , the rest being men of liberal culture , for the most part greeks , in whose conversation he might find amusement

 we had lately money enough even to furnish a donative
 strange as this story was , it derived credibility from the fact that gaetulicus alone of all connected with sejanus lived in safety and in high favour , tiberius bearing in mind the people's hatred , his own extreme age how his government rested more on prestige than on power
 he had himself gone to illyricum and , should it be expedient , he would go to other countries , not always however with a contented mind , if he had to tear himself from a much loved wife , the mother of his many children

 others assert that in the reign of isis the overflowing population of egypt , led by hierosolymus and judas , discharged itself into the neighbouring countries
 his reason for being displeased with vestilius was that he had either written an attack on caius caesar as a profligate , or that tiberius believed a false charge
 when the latter sank into feeble dotage and the former had been ruined by his profligacy , the only remedy for his distracted country was the rule of a single man
 claudius also would do well to strengthen himself with a young prince who could share his cares with him
having held this assembly , and having encouraged the soldiers at the conclusion of his speech , that they should not be dispirited on this account , nor attribute to the valor of the enemy , what the disadvantage of position had caused ; entertaining the same views of his departure that he had previously had , he led forth the legions from the camp , and drew up his army in order of battle in a suitable place .
it happened , by the advantage of situation , by the unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy , by the valor of our soldiers , and their experience in former battles , that they could not stand one attack of our men , and immediately turned their backs ; and our men with full vigor followed them while disordered , and slew a great number of them ; the horse pursuing the rest , left but few , who escaped by flight .
 the plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry

having pronounced this decree between , he exhorted the aedui to bury in oblivion their disputes and dissensions , and , laying aside all these things , devote themselves to the war , and expect from him , on the conquest of gaul , those rewards which they should have earned , and send speedily to him all their cavalry and ten thousand infantry , which he might place in different garrisons to protect his convoys of provisions , and then divided his army into two parts : he gave labienus four legions to lead into the country of the senones and parisii ; and led in person six into the country of the arverni , in the direction of the town of gergovia , along the banks of the allier .
that the bellovaci were the most powerful among them in valor , influence , and the number of men ; that these could muster 100 , 000 armed men , promised 60 , 000 picked men out of that number , and demanded for themselves the command of the whole war .
influenced by these things they do not discharge viridovix and the other leaders from the council , before they gained permission from them to take up arms and hasten to camp ; which being granted , rejoicing as if victory were fully certain , they collected faggots and brushwood , with which to fill up the roman trenches , and hasten to the camp .
 in vespasian's days we saw veleda , long regarded by many as a divinity

the flame having abated a little , and a tower having been brought up in a particular place and touching the rampart , the centurions of the third cohort retired from the place in which they were standing , and drew off all their men : they began to call on the enemy by gestures and by words , to enter if they wished ; but none of them dared to advance .
as the action was carried on in sight of all , neither a brave nor cowardly act could be concealed ; both the desire of praise and the fear of ignominy , urged on each party to valor .
thus the whole island is 2 , 000 miles in circumference .
in the mean time , when intelligence was brought that all their soldiers were in caesar's power , they run in a body to aristius ; they assure him that nothing had been done by public authority ; they order an inquiry to be made about the plundered property ; they confiscate the property of litavicus and his brothers ; they send embassadors to caesar for the purpose of clearing themselves .
 in that battle , no more than two hundred privates were missing , but caesar lost about thirty centurions , valiant officers . 
 i remember to have heard old men say that a document was often seen in piso's hands , the substance of which he never himself divulged , but which his friends repeatedly declared contained a letter from tiberius with instructions referring to germanicus , and that it was his intention to produce it before the senate and upbraid the emperor , had he not been deluded by vain promises from sejanus
 vitellius then ordered that these latter troops should be attached to his own force , in consideration of their loyalty , and that the legion should pass over the graian alps , and then take that line of road , by which they would avoid passing vienna , for the inhabitants of that place were also suspected
 one of these was junia silana , whom messalina had driven from her husband , caius silius , as i have already related conspicuous for her birth , her beauty , and her wantonness , she had long been a special favourite of agrippina , till after a while there were secret mutual dislikes , because sextius africanus , a noble youth , had been deterred from marrying silana by agrippina , who repeatedly spoke of her as an immodest woman in the decline of life , not to secure africanus for herself , but to keep the childless and wealthy widow out of a husband's control
 he flew hither and thither among the cherusci , demanding war against segestes , war against caesar
 if their native state sinks into the sloth of prolonged peace and repose , many of its noble youths voluntarily seek those tribes which are waging some war , both because inaction is odious to their race , and because they win renown more readily in the midst of peril , and cannot maintain a numerous following except by violence and war
at the same time our horsemen , and light-armed infantry , who had been with those , who , as i have related , were routed by the first assault of the enemy , as they were betaking themselves into the camp , met the enemy face to face , and again sought flight into another quarter ; and the camp-followers who from the decuman gate , and from the highest ridge of the hill had seen our men pass the river as victors , when , after going out for the purposes of plundering , they looked back and saw the enemy parading in our camp , committed themselves precipitately to flight ; at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came with the baggage-train : and they , were carried some one way , some another .
 but even while his strength was fast failing he gave up none of his debaucheries in his sufferings he would simulate health , and was wont to jest at the arts of the physician and at all who , after the age of thirty , require another man's advice to distinguish between what is beneficial or hurtful to their constitutions
 he had been repulsed from placentia his auxiliaries had been recently cut up , and even when the skirmishers had met in a series of actions , frequent indeed , but not worth relating , he had been worsted and now that valens was coming up , fearful that all the distinctions of the campaign would centre in that general , he made a hasty attempt to retrieve his credit , but with more impetuosity than prudence
 my respect for vespasian is of long standing while he was still a subject , we were called friends
 staberius the governor , hearing of his approach , began to bring water into the citadel , and to fortify it , and to demand hostages of the town's people . 
 all felt a common alarm at the idea of having to serve elsewhere
 where the noise of the assailants was heard , or where the ladders placed against the walls brought the enemy within reach of their hands , they pushed them back with their shields , and followed them with their javelins
 the winter , they said , the delays of a cowardly inaction must not stop us
 some hesitation had shewn itself , when the generals , seeing that the weary troops would not listen to what seemed to them unmeaning encouragement , pointed to cremona whether this was , as messalla relates , the device of hormus , or whether caius plinius be the better authority when he charges it upon antonius , i cannot easily determine
 africanus was from the santones , one of the states of gaul
by day-break all our soldiers were brought across , and the army of the enemy was in sight .
 consider this too , whether piso dealt with the armies in a revolutionary and seditious spirit whether he sought by intrigue popularity with the soldiers whether he attempted to repossess himself of the province by arms , or whether these are falsehoods which his accusers have published with exaggeration
 in the winter quarters of the legions there is nothing but property to plunder and a few old men

 shame indeed checked the utterance even of a righteous anger
 drusus , thinking that he ought to avail himself of this change in their temper and turn what chance had offered to a wise account , ordered the tents to be visited
 now the conscription is at hand , tearing , we may say , for ever children from parents , and brothers from brothers
labienus , having encouraged his soldiers to retain the memory of their ancient valor , and so many most successful actions , and imagine caesar himself , under whose command they had so often routed the enemy , to be present , gives the signal for action .
 even good men through fear do the like
 the same summer , the germs of a slave war in italy were crushed by a fortunate accident
 the consuls put the question on the regulation of the state . 
 the other germans will abandon them , as but lately did the usipii
 knights and senators perished indiscriminately , and yet their deaths were less deplored because they seemed to forestal the emperor's cruelty by an ordinary death

 therefore , of the number of the ships not one was lost : of the fleet of the massilians five were sunk , four taken , and one ran off with nasidius : all that escaped made the best of their way to hither spain , but one of the rest was sent forward to massilia for the purpose of bearing this intelligence , and when it came near the city , the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings , and , on being informed of the event , were so oppressed with grief , that one would have imagined that the city had been taken by an enemy at the same moment . 
 all their other customs , which are at once perverse and disgusting , owe their strength to their very badness
 he then put an end to a quarrel between the censes and the leptitani , which , originating in robberies of corn and cattle by two rustic populations , had grown from this insignificant beginning till it was carried on in pitched battles

 peculiar consternation was caused by a machine , which , being poised in the air over the heads of the enemy , suddenly descended , and carried up one or more of them past the faces of their friends , and then , by a shifting of the weights , projected them within the limits of the camp
 let me no longer tremblingly experience the madness and perils of the forum , and the pallors of fame
 then , again , an ancient historian has but few disparagers , and no one cares whether you praise more heartily the armies of carthage or rome
 the poorer class of houses had their foundations sapped by the stagnant waters , and fell when the river returned to its channel
accordingly , messengers having been forthwith dispatched to the centrones , the grudii , the levaci , the pleumoxii , and the geiduni , all of whom are under their government , they assemble as large bodies as they can , and rush unexpectedly to the winter-quarters of cicero , the report of the death of titurius not having as yet been conveyed to him .
 to him the decrees of this house , the offices of state , the city of rome seem as nothing
 but there was with them a great number of camp-followers , who had assembled there on the disturbance of peace , and who could be employed in the contest
caesar , thinking that this had happened fortunately enough for him , because he neither wished to leave an enemy behind him , nor had an opportunity for carrying on a war , by reason of the time of year , nor considered that employment in such trifling matters was to be preferred to his enterprise on britain , imposes a large number of hostages ; and when these were brought , he received them to his protection .
 all the incentives to victory are on our side

there , while some were filling up the ditch , and others , by throwing a large number of darts , were driving the defenders from the rampart and fortifications , and the auxiliaries , on whom crassus did not much rely in the battle , by supplying stones and weapons , and by conveying turf to the mound , presented the appearance and character of men engaged in fighting ; while also the enemy were fighting resolutely and boldly , and their weapons , discharged from their higher position , fell with great effect ; the horse , having gone round the camp of the enemy , reported to crassus that the camp was not fortified with equal care on the side of the decuman gate , and had an easy approach .
 about the same time lepidus asked the senate's leave to restore and embellish , at his own expense , the basilica of paulus , that monument of the aemilian family
since the march of our army would be obstructed by these things , the nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected by them .
 this man , whether through some fatal impulse he had indeed never before given any evidence of courage or a misdirected acuteness which made him tremble at the uncertain future , while he forgot impending perils , attached himself to the waverers , and warned the consuls not to enter on the debate
 at first there was a fierce struggle , as is proved by the great speeches delivered by both men
 and indeed the infamy is his who gave them wealth to reward their degradation rather than to deter them from degrading themselves

one thing provided by our men was of great service , sharp hooks inserted into and fastened upon poles , of a form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls .
 the work of rebuilding the capitol was assigned by him to lucius vestinius , a man of the equestrian order , who , however , for high character and reputation ranked among the nobles
having investigated the case , caesar finds that the auxiliaries had been sent by the suevi ; he accepts the apology of the ubii , and makes the minute inquiries concerning the approaches and the routes to the territories of the suevi .
 there he died , and so fulfilled the presage of his destiny
 silius' horse had now , as i have already related , opened the way into italy , and transferred the war across the borders no one entertained any attachment to otho , yet it was not because they preferred vitellius long years of peace had subdued them to any kind of servitude , had made them ready to submit to the first comer and careless about the better cause
 but when once they have joined conflict with us , the help of winds or oars will be unavailing to the vanquished

 that she begged him , alarmed , as he might be , by his mother's peril , to put off the duty of a visit , as for the present she needed repose
he ordered titus labienus , another of his legates , to follow them closely with three legions .
 he had offered her marriage and had won her consent but as soon as she was free , she devised delays , pretended that her father's wishes were against it , and having secured the prospect of a richer husband , she repudiated her promises
 part of the camp occupied the gentle slope of a hill
 on the arrival of these troops the mutiny broke out afresh , and straggling from the camp they plundered the neighbourhood
 they even seized clothes and detained weapons , for the soldiers were utterly cowed and gave up everything , so that no cause for fighting might arise
if the romans were disposed to accept their friendship , they might be serviceable allies to them ; and let them either assign them lands , or permit them to retain those which they had acquired by their arms ; that they are inferior to the suevi alone , to whom not even the immortal gods can show themselves equal ; that there was none at all besides on earth whom they could not conquer .
 i do not ask who is the best speaker meantime i am content to have proved that eloquence has more than one face , and even in those whom you call ancients several varieties are to be discovered nor does it at once follow that difference implies inferiority
 a few only have corslets , and just one or two here and there a metal or leathern helmet
 may we still keep up with our ancestors a rivalry in all that is honourable ! 
 sabinus meantime , while he was concentrating his troops , returned gentle answers but on the arrival of pomponius labeo with a legion from moesia and of king rhoemetalces with some reinforcements from his subjects , who had not thrown off their allegiance , with these and the force he had on the spot , he advanced on the enemy , who were drawn up in some wooded defiles
 it is rich in flocks and herds , but these are for the most part undersized , and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head
elated by this victory , ambiorix marches immediately with his cavalry to the aduatuci , who bordered on his kingdom ; he halts neither day nor night , and orders the infantry to follow him closely .
 marcus valerius and caius aurelius , the consuls , who had already entered on office , and a great number of the people thronged the road in scattered groups , every one weeping as he felt inclined
 how easy to put otho to death ! i must therefore do and dare now while galba's authority is still unsettled , and before that of piso is consolidated
 a man who had struggled with various calamities and earned the hate of many , was then impeached and condemned , but not without angry feelings towards seneca
 anicetus then surrounded the house with a guard , and having burst open the gates , dragged off the slaves who met him , till he came to the door of her chamber , where a few still stood , after the rest had fled in terror at the attack
 hearing this , seeing too that his wrath was subsiding and his passion returning , and fearing , in the event of delay , the effect of approaching night and conjugal recollections , narcissus rushed out , and ordered the centurions and the tribunes , who were on guard , to accomplish the deed of blood
 then suetonius paullinus enjoyed success for two years he subdued several tribes and strengthened our military posts
 in the end caecina was repulsed with great slaughter among his troops , and the night was spent in the preparation of siege-works the vitellianists constructed mantlets , hurdles , and sheds , for undermining the walls and screening the assailants
 caesar was touched by his appeal and inclined to mercy , but his freedmen prevailed on him not to let any indulgence be shown to a player when so many illustrious citizens had fallen
 soon full freedom for their possession caused their oblivion
 drusus went as far as tarracina with claudius , brother of germanicus , and had been at rome
 our ships being at some distance from each other , room was allowed both for the skill of their pilots and the maueuvering of their ships ; and if at any time ours , gaining an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their ships , grappled with them , from all parts they assisted those who were distressed . 
 juba , being informed by sabura of the battle in the night , sent to his relief two thousand spanish and gallic horse , which he was accustomed to keep near him to guard his person , and that part of his infantry on which he had the greatest dependence , and he himself followed slowly after with the rest of his forces and forty elephants , suspecting that as curio had sent his horse before , he himself would follow them . 
 nor could the troops who were posted on the battlements , long withstand the immense number of our darts , but fainting under their wounds , quitted the place , and under the conduct of their centurions and tribunes , fled , without stopping , to the high mountains which joined the camp . 
 agrippina , always impetuous , and now kindled into fury by the peril of her kinswoman , went straight to tiberius and found him , as it happened , offering a sacrifice to his father
 he added nothing about himself , fearing jealousy , or thinking that the conciousness of the achievement was enough
 we still read with admiration the speeches in which lucius crassus in his nineteenth , cæsar and asinius pollio in their twenty-first year , calvus , when very little older , denounced , respectively , carbo , dolabella , cato , and vatinius
 the vitellianist auxiliaries on the spot were routed
and this , though it was small in itself , scarcely 7 , 000 men , and these too without baggage , still by the narrowness of the passages , he contracts as much as he can , with this object , that he may come into the greatest contempt with the enemy .
 though i might allow it , do you imagine it would be tolerated by those who have seen her brother , her father , and our ancestors in the highest offices of state
 not being accustomed to tie themselves by marriage and rear children , they left behind them homes without families
when noon now seemed to draw nigh , he marched hastily against that camp which we have mentioned before ; and , at the same time , the cavalry began to approach the fortifications in the plain , and the rest of the forces to make a demonstration in front of the camp .
 nor are there any advantages in childlessness
they marched for about fifteen days in such a manner that there was not more than five or six miles between the enemy's rear and our van .
 and so the capitol , with its gates shut , neither defended by friends , nor spoiled by a foe , was burnt to the ground
 they came out of their tents , asking what was that mournful sound
 it was , he said , the old custom to nominate together three patricians , sons of parents wedded according to the primitive ceremony , and of these one was to be chosen
 he urged the virulence of his enemies , who refused to comply with what they required from others , and had rather that all things should be thrown into confusion , than that they should lose their power and their armies . 
 here is the true image , sprung of heavenly blood , and she perceives her danger , and assumes its mournful emblems
 the auxiliary infantry and cavalry , summoned long before , had hastened to join him after his victory
having arranged these matters , he marches to vienna by as long journeys as he can , when his own soldiers did not expect him .
 triumphal distinctions were voted to ostorius , who thus far had been successful , but soon afterwards met with reverses either because , when caractacus was out of the way , our discipline was relaxed under an impression that the war was ended , or because the enemy , out of compassion for so great a king , was more ardent in his thirst for vengeance
 fronto went further , and insisted on restrictions being put on plate , furniture , and household establishments
 what made such deaths eagerly sought was dread of the executioner , and the fact too that the condemned , besides forfeiture of their property , were deprived of burial , while those who decided their fate themselves , had their bodies interred , and their wills remained valid , a recompense this for their despatch
 civilis , who was recognised while seeking to stop his flying troops , became the mark of many missiles , left his horse , and swam across the river
 do the praetorian cohorts , which have just got their two denarii per man , and which after sixteen years are restored to their homes , encounter more perils
 thus the first day's inquiry was futile
 when these things were nearly completed , being informed of curio's approach , he made a complaint that he was abandoned and betrayed by pompey , who had undertaken an unnecessary war , without making any preparation , and when questioned by him and other members in the senate , had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for the war . 
 soon after , the legions arrived
 this officer , thinking that he could carry out the order more at his leisure , when the camp was quiet , opened the armoury , and ordered the wagons of the cohort to be laden at night-fall the time provoked suspicion , the motive challenged accusation , the elaborate attempt at quiet ended in a disturbance , and the sight of arms among a drunken crowd excited the desire to use them the soldiers murmured , and charged the tribunes and centurions with treachery , alleging that the households of the senators were being armed to destroy otho
 when these men prose in the old style before the judges , they have neither select listeners nor a popular audience
sabinus kept himself within his camp , which was in a position convenient for everything ; while viridovix encamped over against him at a distance of two miles , and daily bringing out his forces , gave him an opportunity of fighting ; so that sabinus had now not only come into contempt with the enemy , but also was somewhat taunted by the speeches of our soldiers ; and furnished so great a suspicion of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to approach even to the very rampart of our camp .
 nero gave both of them the roman franchise , and ordered the frisii to withdraw from the territory in question
 the most complimentary form of assent is to express approbation with their weapons
 at any rate , all the glory of a successful remedy would be caesar's , while the ridicule of failure would fall on the sufferers
 the fiercest clamour arose from the veteran soldiers , who , as they counted their thirty campaigns or more , implored him to relieve worn-out men , and not let them die under the same hardships , but have an end of such harassing service , and repose without beggary
to these remarks caesar replied in such terms as he thought proper ; but the conclusion of his speech was , that he could make no alliance with them , if they continued in gaul ; that it was not probable that they who were not able to defend their own territories , should get possession of those of others , nor were there any lands lying waste in gaul , which could be given away , especially to so great a number of men , without doing wrong ; but they might , if they were desirous , settle in the territories of the ubii ; whose ambassadors were then with him , and were complaining of the aggressions of the suevi , and requesting assistance from him ; and that he would obtain this request from them .
a great slaughter ensues ; some leave their horses , and endeavor to cross the ditch and climb the wall .
 many trusted to old superstitions , or to their services to the roman people
 while agricola was yet speaking , the ardour of the soldiers was rising to its height , and the close of his speech was followed by a great outburst of enthusiasm
 when they approached a valley or declivity , and the advanced men could not impart assistance to the tardy , our horse threw their darts at them from the rising grounds with advantage ; then their affairs were in a perilous situation ; the only plan left was , that whenever they came near such places , they should give orders to the legions to halt , and by a violent effort repulse our horse ; and these being forced to give way , they should suddenly , with the utmost speed , run all together down to the valley , and having passed it , should face about again on the next hill . 
 the young man himself , anxious to be thought superior to his station , was ever displaying his gracefulness and his energy in war by his courtesy and affability he called forth a willing obedience , and he often mixed with the common soldiers , while working or marching , without impairing his dignity as general
to these cicero made only one reply : that it is not the custom of the roman people to accept any condition from an armed enemy : if they are willing to lay down their arms , they may employ him as their advocate and send embassadors to caesar : that he believed , from his justice , they would obtain the things which they might request .
 but while the miseries of the state were daily growing worse , its supports were becoming weaker
 a race without either natural or acquired cunning , they disclose their hidden thoughts in the freedom of the festivity
 the close array of the legions , and the skirmishing parties of auxiliaries assailed with showers of arrows and stones the loftier parts of the walls , attacking them at close quarters where they were undefended , or old and decayed
 the same year witnessed shows of gladiators as magnificent as those of the past
 for this reason the emperor had entrusted to him , as being the confidant of his amours , poppaea sabina , the imperial favourite , until he could rid himself of his wife octavia soon suspecting him with regard to this same poppaea , he sent him out of the way to the province of lusitania , ostensibly to be its governor

 john and simon were strong in numbers and equipment , eleazar in position
caesar , when informed of these matters , fearing the fickle disposition of the gauls , who are easily prompted to take up resolutions , and much addicted to change , considered that nothing was to be intrusted to them ; for it is the custom of that people to compel travelers to stop , even against their inclination , and inquire what they may have heard , or may know , respecting any matter ; and in towns the common people throng around merchants and force them to state from what countries they come , and what affairs they know of there .
 lucius , the praetor , fled from alba , with six cohorts : rutilus , lupus , the praetor , from tarracina , with three .

 some public money had been embezzled , and he was pressing for its payment too rigorously for the patience of barbarians
 men's grief at all this had not died away when news was heard of agrippina she had lived on , sustained by hope , i suppose , after the destruction of sejanus , and , when she found no abatement of horrors , had voluntarily perished , though possibly nourishment was refused her and a fiction concocted of a death that might seem self-chosen

vercingetorix follows closely upon caesar by shorter marches , and selects for his camp a place defended by woods and marshes , at the distance of fifteen miles from avaricum .

 they flew to arms , and as the rage of the soldiers at the supposed treachery fell upon t
 domitius required certain ships for his own use , which he manned with colonists and shepherds , whom he had brought along with him . 
 other men's money he did not covet , with his own he was parsimonious , with that of the state avaricious
he himself , though the matter was one of great difficulty and labor , yet thought it to be most expedient for all the ships to be brought up on shore and joined with the camp by one fortification .

 drusus germanicus indeed did not lack daring
 scarcely allowing a day's interval , he left germanicus and hastened on in advance when he reached syria and the legions , he began , by bribery and favouritism , to encourage the lowest of the common soldiers , removing the old centurions and the strict tribunes and assigning their places to creatures of his own or to the vilest of the men , while he allowed idleness in the camp , licentiousness in the towns , and the soldiers to roam through the country and take their pleasure

 when the people of rome asked for a remission of the one per cent tax on all saleable commodities , tiberius declared by edict that the military exchequer depended on that branch of revenue , and , further , that the state was unequal to the burden , unless the twentieth year of service were to be that of the veteran's discharge thus the ill-advised results of the late mutiny , by which a limit of sixteen campaigns had been extorted , were cancelled for the future
it had been made lately , too , in italy , during the rebellion of the slaves , whom , however , the experience and training which they had received from us , assisted in some respect .
 gradually forsaken by the very slaves who waited on him , he turned into ridicule the ill-timed attentions of his stepmother , perceiving their insincerity
 he taunted macro , in no obscure terms , with forsaking the setting and looking to the rising sun
 their able-bodied men had swum across the river adrana , and were trying to keep back the romans as they were commencing a bridge
 but when domitian harangued them a few days afterwards , they received him with increased confidence
 at the same time shouts were heard from the people in front of the senate house , threatening violence if he escaped the verdict of the senators
 the boy , who was brought up at ravenna , soon afterwards suffered an insult , which at the proper time i shall relate
 some flat-bottomed , that they might ground without being injured
 thus passing each other , they separated after a brief discharge of light missiles
 the victorious army , wearing their proper decorations and arms , he drew up with moderate intervals of space between the divisions
 it was the dread of personal humiliation that made marcellus so earnest , for he feared that , if others were chosen , he should himself appear slighted
 yet religious rites had not ceased if during so many years it was possible for there to be no appointment without any prejudice to religion , with what comparative ease might he be absent for one year's proconsulate
 most of them laughed at the effrontery of such a comparison , though some were pleased at the very circumstance of his having selected , not one of the most influential men of the time , but thrasea , as his model of true glory
 by this means , the lesser camp , included within the greater , answered the purpose of a fort and citadel . 
 doubtless it was good for the state that vitellius should be overthrown , but they who betrayed vitellius to vespasian cannot make a merit of their treachery , since they had themselves revolted from galba
 this would have befitted a private individual anxious to shun all appearance of imperial power
 as soon as it was sufficiently clear to those who keenly watch the angry moods of princes , that vitellius was exasperated , and that blaesus might be destroyed , the part of the informer was intrusted to lucius vitellius
 but he spurned the notion , and unwilling to disgrace a life which had clung to freedom by a final act of servility , he bestowed on his slaves all his ready money , and ordered each to convey away for himself whatever he could carry , leaving only three couches for the last scene
 enter then on life with a brave heart , and never entirely forget , or remember too vividly , that otho was your uncle
 i have to present in succession the merciless biddings of a tyrant , incessant prosecutions , faithless friendships , the ruin of innocence , the same causes issuing in the same results , and i am everywhere confronted by a wearisome monotony in my subject matter
 pacensis , however , was put in irons by his insubordinate troops , antonius possessed no kind of authority , and clemens commanded only for popularity , and was as reckless in transgressing the good order of military discipline as he was eager to fight
upon their valiantly resisting , he raised vineae and turrets .
 nor did they stand the sight and charge of our men , and the foremost falling , the rest turned their backs and quitted the field . 
that being dispersed , they made a charge on them with drawn swords .
 hence there was no criminal , whose doom was from opposite motives more importunately demanded , as well by those who hated nero , as by those who regretted him
 the whole populace and the slaves with them were now crowding the palace , clamouring with discordant shouts for the death of otho and the destruction of the conspirators , just as if they were demanding some spectacle in the circus or amphitheatre
 could they be going to the treveri , to be subjects of the foreigner
 the harii , besides being superior in strength to the tribes just enumerated , savage as they are , make the most of their natural ferocity by the help of art and opportunity
 he was no intruder , they said , on an unwilling people he had obeyed a call superior as he was to all others in noble birth , should they not put his valour to the test , and see whether he showed himself worthy of his uncle arminius and his grandfather catumerus
 and silanus failed not to resist and to strike blows , as well as he could with his bare hands , till he was cut down by the centurion , as though in battle , with wounds in his breast
 they received his speech with enthusiasm , and as is usual among barbarians , with songs , shouts and discordant cries
 then , by sailing rapidly and by the shortest route through the cyclades , he overtook germanicus at the island of rhodes
 nero meanwhile availed himself of his country's desolation , and erected a mansion in which the jewels and gold , long familiar objects , quite vulgarised by our extravagance , were not so marvellous as the fields and lakes , with woods on one side to resemble a wilderness , and , on the other , open spaces and extensive views the directors and contrivers of the work were severus and celer , who had the genius and the audacity to attempt by art even what nature had refused , and to fool away an emperor's resources
 they pass whole days on the hearth by the fire the wealthiest are distinguished by a dress which is not flowing , like that of the sarmatæ and parthi , but is tight , and exhibits each limb
 about the same time , vonones , who , as i have related , had been banished to cilicia , endeavoured by bribing his guards to escape into armenia , thence to albania and heniochia , and to his kinsman , the king of scythia
 both the consuls leave the city , and private men had lictors in the city and capital , contrary to all precedents of former times . 
 then he confined her in the island of pandataria
 pompey , having made great additions to his works in the night , the following days built turrets , and having carried his works fifteen feet high , faced that part of his camp with mantelets ; and after an interval of five days , taking advantage of a second cloudy night , he barricaded all the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit , and about midnight , quietly marched off his army , and retreated to his old fortifications . 
 petreius and afranius , having got this opportunity , retired to their camp . 
 when every one in the senate , those especially who had most cause to mourn , abased himself in flattery , salienus clemens denounced junius gallio , who was terror-stricken at his brother seneca's death was pleading for his life he called him an enemy and traitor to the state , till the unanimous voice of the senators deterred him from perverting public miseries into an occasion for a personal resentment , and thus importing fresh bitterness into what by the prince's clemency had been hushed up or forgotten
 according to some writers , poison was prepared for him at nero's command by his own freedman , whose name was cleonicus this seneca avoided through the freedman's disclosure , or his own apprehension , while he used to support life on the very simple diet of wild fruits , with water from a running stream when thirst prompted
 now that their youth were restored to them they could more easily bear the burden of the tribute and , finding themselves despised , they were more ready to obey civilis and classicus , having heard of the defeat of tutor and of the rout of the treveri , and indeed of the complete success of the enemy , hastened in their alarm to concentrate their own scattered forces , and meanwhile sent repeated messages to valentinus , warning him not to risk a decisive battle
 marauding parties were also led by picked moors , dolabella in person directing every operation
 vote impunity , in heaven's name , and then who will be protected by his rank , when the prefecture of the capital has been of no avail to its holder
 i had men and horses , arms and wealth
 they all wrap themselves in a cloak which is fastened with a clasp , or , if this is not forthcoming , with a thorn , leaving the rest of their persons bare
 but people generally had no pleasure in the memory of quirinus , because of the perils he had brought , as i have related , on lepida , and the meanness and dangerous power of his last years
 why , if his friend or relative or even he himself stumbles into some troublesome affair , he will run to secundus here , or to you , maternus , not because you are a poet or that you may make verses for him
 and so matters , which as being still not accurately known my predecessors embellished with their eloquence , shall now be related on the evidence of facts
 but in our day we entrust the infant to a little greek servant-girl who is attended by one or two , commonly the worst of all the slaves , creatures utterly unfit for any important work
 in addition to this loss , they were prevented from getting water by the horse which antonius had disposed along the sea-coast . 
 gaining credit by the result , and arguing from his own conjectures and from the common talk of those who compared galba's age with otho's youth , he had persuaded the latter that he would be called to the throne
 tax could be lightened , which , for the future , he fixed at one-half per cent during the same time , on the deaths of antiochus and philopator , kings respectively of the commageni and cilicians , these nations became excited , a majority desiring the roman rule , some , that of their kings
 feasts and entertainments , which , though inelegant , are plentifully furnished , are their only pay
 about the same time the proconsul lucius piso was murdered
 they wished also to keep their own soldiers from passing their unoccupied time in idleness boats were ranged at equal distances from each other , connected at both ends by strong beams , and with their heads turned against the current , while anchors were thrown out above to keep the bridge firm the cables , however , instead of being taut , hung loose in the water , in order that as the stream rose the vessels might rise without their arrangement being disturbed on the end of the bridge was placed a turret
 silius had a wife , sosia galla , whose love of agrippina made her hateful to the emperor
 as the enemy were scattered everywhere , while from the fact that the battle was raging within the entrenchments , they were themselves hampered with their tents and baggage
 vitellius seemed unconscious
 his defence was that of all this he had done nothing on his own responsibility but had simply obeyed the emperor , till nero stopped such pleadings , by stating that he had ascertained from his father's notebooks that he had never compelled the prosecution of a single person
 the following day showed more fully the extent of the calamity , for the silence of desolation reigned everywhere 
although caesar was aware of this proceeding , yet he addresses the embassadors with as much mildness as he can : that he did not think worse of the state on account of the ignorance and fickleness of the mob , nor would diminish his regard for the aedui .
 still it would not have been right for me to conceal what was related by those who lived up to the time of my youth
 hence came cruel severities , immediately exercised on the humble , and resentments , concealed for the moment , but subsequently paid off , towards men of distinction
 presently valerius messalinus , messala's son , in whom the father's eloquence was reproduced , replied that much of the sternness of antiquity had been changed into a better and more genial system
 in the mean time , on the arrival of his men of war , curio ordered proclamation to be made to the merchant ships , which lay at anchor before utica , in number about two hundred , that he would treat as enemies all that did not set sail immediately for the cornelian camp . 
 the general saw how unequal this close fighting was , and having withdrawn his legions to a little distance , ordered the slingers and artillerymen to discharge a volley of missiles and scatter the enemy
 at last , in an interval of the uproar , drusus read his father's letter , in which it was fully stated that he had a special care for the brave legions with which he had endured a number of campaigns
 finally , by this plan he either secured safety , or he would suffer nothing worse by daring than by cowardice
 after having thus spoken , he courteously entreated all in terms befitting their age and rank to go at once , and not exasperate the anger of the conqueror by staying with the young he used his authority , with the old his prayers , and still his look was calm , his speech collected , as he checked the unseasonable tears of his friends
 the assailants could not be checked as they mounted the continuous line of buildings , which , as was natural in a time of profound peace , had grown up to such a height as to be on a level with the soil of the capitol
 the first business of the campaign was to levy troops and recall the veterans to service
 thereupon , as though he were contracting the pollution of guilt , he leapt impetuously from the tribunal
 it was to cut off all passage at this point from the armies of germany that they had barred this route
 pollio's daughter was preferred , only because her mother had lived with one and the same husband , while agrippa had impaired the honour of his house by a divorce
 on this pretext a thanksgiving was decreed , and also the expulsion from the senate of sulla and plautus , more grievous , however , as a farce than as an actual calamity
 by an edict which gratified the leading men of the state , while it approved itself even to the populace , vitellius gave back to the returned exiles their rights over their freedmen , although servile ingenuity sought in every way to neutralise the boon , concealing money in quarters which either obscurity or rank rendered secure some freedmen had made their way into the palace of the emperor , and thus became more powerful even than their patrons
 meantime junius blaesus received an extension of his government of africa , and servius maluginensis , the priest of jupiter , demanded to have asia allotted to him it was , he asserted , a popular error that it was not lawful for the priests of jupiter to leave italy in fact , his own legal position differed not from that of the priests of mars and of quirinus
 as the men were dragged off , they struggled violently , clasped the knees of the bystanders , called to their comrades by name , or to the company , cohort , or legion to which they respectively belonged , exclaiming that all were threatened with the same fate
 that his only hope of safety was in bold action that in such action two paths were open he might defend himself on the spot , or he might sail for gaul and offer his services as general to the vitellianist armies
 they are to every man the most sacred witnesses of his bravery they are his most generous applauders
induced by all these things , the enemy lead over their forces and draw up their line in a disadvantageous position ; and as our men also had been led down from the ramparts , they approach nearer , and throw their weapons into the fortification from all sides , and sending heralds round , order it to be proclaimed that , if any , either gaul or roman , was willing to go over to them before the third hour , it was permitted ; after that time there would not be permission ; and so much did they disregard our men , that the gates having been blocked up with single rows of turf as a mere appearance , because they did not seem able to burst in that way , some began to pull down the rampart with their hands , others to fill up the trenches .
 about the same time sextus papinius , who belonged to a family of consular rank , chose a sudden and shocking death , by throwing himself from a height
 the roman knights offered their services and money , and even the freedmen voluntarily sought the privilege of doing the same
 the character of valens did not stand well with caecina's army they complained that , though so much weaker in numbers , they had been exposed to the whole force of the enemy , thus at once excusing themselves , and extolling , in the implied flattery , the strength of the new arrivals , who might , they feared , despise them as beaten and spiritless soldiers
 after parading these pretexts for quarrel , they pointed out how vast would be the plunder from secret encouragement they passed to open entreaty
 his unpopularity was heightened by the efforts of roscius caelius , the legate of the 20th legion , who had long been on bad terms with him , and who now seized the opportunity of a civil war to break out into greater violence
 it was the peril of the legions which had stirred him to leave his province , and , as there was uncertainty about the designs of the parthians , he should return to syria , and , even as it was , he must pray for fortune under her most favourable aspect in order that the infantry , wearied out with long marches , might keep pace with the enemy's untiring cavalry , certain to outstrip him on the plains , which facilitated their movements
on the next day , caesar , having called a meeting , censured the rashness and avarice of his soldiers , in that they had judged for themselves how far they ought to proceed , or what they ought to do , and could not be kept back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the lieutenants ; and stated , what the disadvantage of the ground could effect , what opinion he himself had entertained at avaricum , when having surprised the enemy without either general or cavalry , he had given up a certain victory , lest even a trifling loss should occur in the contest owing to the disadvantage of position .
 if , whenever orders are given , individuals may ask questions , obedience ceases , and all command is at an end
 a vast multitude streamed to the spot with torches , and as soon as all knew that she was safe , they at once prepared to wish her joy , till the sight of an armed and threatening force scared them away
 can it be that he is not satisfied with your sorrows and griefs
together with these embassadors came commius the atrebatian , who , as i have above said , had been sent by caesar into britain him they had seized upon when leaving his ship , although in the character of embassador he bore the general's commission to them , and thrown into chains : then after the battle was fought , they sent him back , and in suing for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common people , and entreated that it might be pardoned on account of their indiscretion .
 minucius was of equestrian rank , and both had enjoyed , though discreetly , the friendship of sejanus
 temples were thronged with the vilest of the slaves
this day was the fifth before the kalends of april in the consulship of lucius piso and aulus gabinius .
 he stood too with fearless countenance when he was exposed to the people's gaze near the rostra , under military guard
 and so the senate , when the question was put , gave the preference to smyrna
 for livia had surrounded the house and its approaches with a strict watch , and favourable bulletins were published from time to time , till , provision having been made for the demands of the crisis , one and the same report told men that augustus was dead and that tiberius nero was master of the state
he stations quintus tullius cicero , and publius sulpicius among the aedui at cabillo and matisco on the saone , to procure supplies of corn .
 tiberius instantly broke out into invective against haterius
to their nobles he promises money , and to their state the dominion of the whole province .
 a gracious look predominated
 it is an ornament in peace and a defence in war and not only in his own tribe but also in the neighbouring states it is the renown and glory of a chief to be distinguished for
 he alleged , too , against him the following charges 
 antonius then went to vespasian , who received him , not indeed as he expected , but in a not unfriendly spirit
the matrons begin to cast their clothes and silver over the wall , and bending over as far as the lower part of the bosom , with outstretched hands beseech the romans to spare them , and not to sacrifice to their resentment even women and children , as they had done at avaricum .
 the rebels , conscious of their guilt , and finding escape barred , performed many noble feats
 there was respect shown to the allies
they point to ambiorix for the purpose of obtaining credence ; they are mistaken , say they , if they hoped for any relief from those who distrust their own affairs ; that they bear such feelings toward cicero and the roman people that they deny them nothing but winter-quarters , and are unwilling that the practice should become constant ; that through their means it is possible for them to depart from their winter-quarters safely and to proceed without fear into whatever parts they desire .
they , as they had been commanded , having brought out the four cohorts , which , as they had been left as a guard for the camp , were not fatigued by exertion , and having led them round by a some what longer way , lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy , when the eyes and minds of all were intent upon the battle , quickly arrived at those fortifications which we have spoken of , and , having demolished these , stood in the camp of the enemy before they were seen by them , or it was known what was going on .
 by all his words and acts he sought to pave for himself the way to power
 incessantly were there flying through the public places , through private houses , country fields , and the neighbouring villages , horse and foot soldiers , mixed with germans , whom the emperor trusted as being foreigners in long succession , troops of prisoners in chains were dragged along and stood at the gates of his gardens
 after this their march was uninterrupted , and the soldiery , with the confidence of recent success , and forgetful of the past , were placed in winter-quarters
but vercingetorix , having pitched his camp on the mountain near the town , placed the forces of each state separately and at small intervals around himself , and having occupied all the hills of that range as far as they commanded a view , he presented a formidable appearance ; he ordered the rulers of the states , whom he had selected as his council of war , to come to him daily at the dawn , whether any measure seemed to require deliberation or execution .
 the first legion from the fleet was sent into spain , that in the peaceful repose of that province their excitement might subside the 7th and 11th were sent back to their winter quarters
 for they were all quartered in the same summer-camp , in the territory of the ubii , enjoying ease or having only light duties
 but the crime imputed to him was friendship with plautus and intrigues to lure the province into thoughts of revolt
 they meantime , he said , would hold to their fidelity while life lasted
 the numbers of the germans also increased as fresh troops continued to join both sides , a regular battle ensued
 augustus meanwhile , as supports to his despotism , raised to the pontificate and curule aedileship claudius marcellus , his sister's son , while a mere stripling , and marcus agrippa , of humble birth , a good soldier , and one who had shared his victory , to two consecutive consulships , and as marcellus soon afterwards died , he also accepted him as his son-in-law
 a battle or even a skirmish it did not deserve to be called , in which merely half-armed stragglers were slaughtered without bloodshed on our side
 but vocula , leaving the flying foe , began to strengthen the rampart and the towers of the camp , as if another siege were imminent
 then tearing them from the ground , mangled , and some lifeless , they flung them outside the entrenchments or into the river rhine
 every one else was repulsed with noisy cries
in like manner , in another quarter two different legions , the eleventh and the eighth , having routed the viromandui , with whom they had engaged , were fighting from the higher ground upon the very banks of the river .
some fearing a trial , fled ; when he had forbidden these fire and water , he stationed in winter quarters two legions at the frontiers of the treviri , two among the lingones , the remaining six at agendicum , in the territories of the senones ; and , having provided corn for the army , he set out for italy , as he had determined , to hold the assizes .
 the truth indeed is this , my excellent friends , that cicero's wonderful eloquence wells up and overflows out of a store of erudition , a multitude of accomplishments , and a knowledge that was universal
 then came a procession of the royal vassals , and the ornaments and neck-chains and the spoils which the king had won in wars with other tribes , were displayed
 even in the years which , on the pretext of seclusion he spent in exile at rhodes , he had had no thoughts but of wrath , hypocrisy , and secret sensuality
 but now all are on the same side , and we have whatever remnant of military vigour still flourished in the camps of rome
 germanicus accordingly gave caecina four legions , five thousand auxiliaries , with some hastily raised levies from the germans dwelling on the left bank of the rhine
 they retired to their walls , and there , without fear , set the musculus and brick tower on fire . 
 consequently , the sentries were strengthened with denser masses of troops
 piling up logs of wood round the walls and lighting them , they sat feasting , and rushed to the conflict , as each grew heated with wine , with a useless daring
but the barbarians , upon perceiving the design of the romans , sent forward their cavalry and charioteers , a class of warriors of whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles , and following with the rest of their forces , endeavored to prevent our men landing .
 a year of shame and of so many evil deeds heaven also marked by storms and pestilence
 what you will have to encounter is indeed perfectly plain there will be the darkness , the strange localities of the town , the enemy inside the walls , and all possible facilities for ambuscades
he plans the size and shape of them .
 the evils which first began in rome soon spread through italy , and are now diffusing themselves into the provinces
 for the rhine after flowing continuously in a single channel or encircling merely insignificant islands , divides itself , so to say , where the batavian territory begins , into two rivers , retaining its name and the rapidity of its course in the stream which washes germany , till it mingles with the ocean
 minucius and servaeus , on being condemned , went over to the prosecution , and then julius africanus with seius quadratus were dragged into the same ruin
 if you , who have been victorious in so many campaigns , who have so often routed the enemy at gelduba and at the old camp , yet shrink from battle , this indeed is an unworthy fear
 having come to this resolution , they gave orders to collect all the ships in the river ebro , and to bring them to octogesa , a town situated on the river ebro , about twenty miles distant from their camp . 
 he then concluded that it was a divine apparition , and discovered an oracular force in the name of basilides
 if , said she , you have come to see me , take back word that i have recovered , but if you are here to do a crime , i believe nothing about my son
the germans when , upon hearing a noise behind them , saw that their families were being slain , throwing away their arms and abandoning their standards , fled out of the camp , and when they had arrived at the confluence of the meuse and the rhine , the survivors despairing of further escape , as a great number of their countrymen had been killed , threw themselves into the river and there perished , overcome by fear , fatigue , and the violence of the stream .
 but in that heart , utterly corrupted by profligacy , nothing noble remained she still prolonged her tears and idle complaints , till the gates were forced open by the rush of the new comers , and there stood at her side the tribune , sternly silent , and the freedman , overwhelming her with the copious insults of a servile tongue
 but for my plan of referring each event to its own year , i should feel a strong impulse to anticipate matters and at once relate the deaths by which latinius and opsius and the other authors of this atrocious deed perished , some after caius became emperor , some even while tiberius yet ruled for although he would not have the instruments of his wickedness destroyed by others , he frequently , when he was tired of them , and fresh ones offered themselves for the same services , flung off the old , now become a mere incubus
 everything , sacred or profane , the temple too of tamfana , as they called it , the special resort of all those tribes , was levelled to the ground
 do not , i conjure you , suffer a dishonor to be sustained in the field , which never before happened to caesar's army , but deliver it safe into his hands . 
 in the hope that they might be fired to courage by the delights of plunder , vocula led the army against the nearest villages of the gugerni , who had accepted the alliance of civilis
 these two men guided the emperor's youth with an unity of purpose seldom found where authority is shared , and though their accomplishments were wholly different , they had equal influence burrus , with his soldier's discipline and severe manners , seneca , with lessons of eloquence and a dignified courtesy , strove alike to confine the frailty of the prince's youth , should he loathe virtue , within allowable indulgences
 if you would act as becomes the censorship , the thrice-repeated consulate of your father , and all the honours of your illustrious house , let despair at any rate arm you to courageous action
 tigellinus , who was daily becoming more powerful and who thought that the wicked schemings which alone gave him strength , would be better liked if he could secure the emperor's complicity in guilt , dived into nero's most secret apprehensions , and , as soon as he had ascertained that plautus and sulla were the men he most dreaded , plautus having been lately sent away to asia , sulla to gallia narbonensis , he spoke much of their noble rank and of their respective proximity to the armies of the east and of germany
 it was a hideous and terrible sight not forty days had passed since the battle , and there lay mangled corpses , severed limbs , the putrefying forms of men and horses the soil was saturated with gore , and , what with levelled trees and crops , horrible was the desolation
 lucius stertinius was despatched by germanicus with a flying column and routed the bructeri as they were burning their possessions , and amid the carnage and plunder , found the eagle of the nineteenth legion which had been lost with varus
 the rest affected indignation at the idea that a consul had betrayed the state , a general his emperor , a man loaded with wealth so vast and honours so numerous his benefactor , and seemed to deplore the wrongs of vitellius , while they uttered their private griefs
 the greed of the foe helped him , for they left the slaughter to secure the spoil , and the legions , towards evening , struggled on to open and firm ground
 curio detached marcus before with the fleet to utica , and marched thither with his army . 
 riches were one thing with the fabricii , quite another with the scipios
 vitellius with his sensuality and gluttony was his own enemy otho , with his profligacy , his cruelty , and his recklessness , was held to be more dangerous to the commonwealth
 in a word , either freedom will follow on our efforts , or , if we are vanquished , we shall but be what we were before
 thus this nation , whose settlements and territories are on their own side of the river , are yet in sentiment and purpose one with us in all other respects they resemble the batavi , except that they still gain from the soil and climate of their native land a keener vigour
 there were close at hand seven legions
 a legion of troops drafted from the fleet followed
 behind him , however , came in a vast body the 6th legion and 13 , 000 veterans
 on questioning the centurion , and finding that he had sought a pretext for accusing and murdering him , he ordered the man to be executed , moved , not so much by any hope of saving his life , as by indignation against the assassin for this fellow had been one of the murderers of macer , and was now come to slay the proconsul with hands already stained with the blood of the legate
 he had the guard under arms , with all the other adjuncts of a court
these either through their want of canvas and their ignorance of its application , or for this reason , which is more probable , that they thought that such storms of the ocean , and such violent gales of wind could not be resisted by sails , nor ships of such great burden be conveniently enough managed by them .
the rest , on observing this action , fearing lest they should be surrounded , betake themselves to flight .
 to this view they assented , but that they might not be thought to have approved the crime and receive contrary orders from the emperor , envoys were sent to pharasmanes , requiring him to withdraw from armenian territory and remove his son
he granted the petition of the aedui , that they might settle the boii , in their own territories , as these were known to be of distinguished valor , to whom they gave lands , and whom they afterward admitted to the same state of rights and freedom as themselves .
 but as soon as they appeared in his presence , without hearing them , or learning the occasion of their coming , he ordered them to be seized and put to death . 
 throughout asia and achaia not only votive gifts , but the images of deities were seized , acratus and secundus carinas having been sent into those provinces
 there were numerous desertions among the tribunes and centurions
 pompey weighed anchor at nightfall .
